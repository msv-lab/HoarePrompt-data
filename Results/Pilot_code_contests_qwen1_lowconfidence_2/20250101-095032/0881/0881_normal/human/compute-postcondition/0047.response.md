The code `s += 'B'` appends the character 'B' to the string `s`. Given the initial state, `s` is initially set to the string 'B'. Appending 'B' to 'B' results in 'BB'. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 1` if `a >= b`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is either `0` or `k`, `d` is `True`, `s` is 'BB', `i` is 1.**
