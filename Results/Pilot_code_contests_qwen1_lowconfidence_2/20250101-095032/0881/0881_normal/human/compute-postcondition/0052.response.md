Postcondition: ***`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 1` if `a >= b`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, `s` is 'BB', `i` is 1, if `b < a`, `c` is 0 and `d` is `False`; otherwise, the values of `c` and `d` remain unchanged.***
