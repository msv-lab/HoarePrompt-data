`c` is incremented by 1. The original value of `c` is 0, so now `c` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 2` if `a >= b` and `a` was originally `vals[2] - 1`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is `vals[3] - 2`, `c` is 1, `d` is `True`, `s` is either `'BGB'` or `'BBB'`, `i` is 2.**
