The code `d = not d` changes the value of `d`. Initially, `d` is `False`. After applying `not` to `False`, `d` becomes `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 2` if `a >= b` and `a` was originally `vals[2] - 1`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is `True`, `s` is either `'BG'` or `'BB'`, `i` is 2**
