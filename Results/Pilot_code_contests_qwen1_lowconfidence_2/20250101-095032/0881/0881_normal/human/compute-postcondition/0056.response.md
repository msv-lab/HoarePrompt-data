Postcondition: ***`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 2` if `a >= b` and `a` was originally `vals[2] - 1`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, `s` is either `'BG'` or `'BB'`, `i` is 1, the program prints 'NO' to the console, and the execution is terminated.***

Explanation:
- If `a < 0` or `b < 0` is true, the program prints 'NO' to the console and terminates, resulting in the postcondition where `c` remains 0 (as specified in the if part).
- There is no else part in the code, so the postcondition does not change if the condition `a < 0 or b < 0` is false.

Since the else part is empty, the postcondition remains as described in the if part, which is that `c` remains 0.
