The code `vals = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `vals`. The length of this list will be equal to the number of space-separated integers entered by the user.

Since the initial state defines that `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are integers with the conditions specified, and the code does not affect these variables, they remain unchanged. However, a new list `vals` is created based on the user's input.

The output state will include the new list `vals` which contains the integers entered by the user, and the original variables `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain as per their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n; `vals` is a list containing integers entered by the user.**
