Postcondition: ***`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 1` if `a >= b`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2]`; `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3]`; `c` is `0`; `d` is `False`; `s` is `'B'`; `i` is `0`. If `a < 0` or `b < 0`, the values of `d` and `s` remain unchanged.***
