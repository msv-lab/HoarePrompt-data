Postcondition: ***`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is adjusted based on the comparison with `b`. Specifically, if `a < b`, then `a` is set to `vals[2] - 2`, otherwise `a` remains `vals[2] - 3`. `b` is adjusted based on the comparison with `a`, so if `b >= a`, `b` is set to `vals[3] - 1`, otherwise `b` remains `vals[3] - 1`. `c` is 1, `d` is `True`, `s` is either `'BGG'` or `'BBG'`, `i` is 2.***
