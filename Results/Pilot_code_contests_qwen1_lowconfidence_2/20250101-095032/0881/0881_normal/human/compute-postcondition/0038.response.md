The variable `d` is updated to the opposite of its current value due to the `not` operator. Since `d` was initially `False`, it will now be `True`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 1` if `a >= b`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is `0`, `d` is `True`, `s` is `'B'`, `i` is `1`**
