Postcondition: ***`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 2` if `a >= b` and `a` was originally `vals[2] - 1`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is `True`, `s` is either `'BG'` or `'BB'`, `i` is 2. The condition `c == k` is true, and thus `d` is set to `True`.***
