`s` is concatenated with the string `'B'`. The initial value of `s` is either `'BG'` or `'BB'`. After concatenation, `s` will become `'BGB'` if it was initially `'BG'`, or `'BBB'` if it was initially `'BB'`.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 2` if `a >= b` and `a` was originally `vals[2] - 1`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is `True`, `s` is either `'BGB'` or `'BBB'`, `i` is 2.**
