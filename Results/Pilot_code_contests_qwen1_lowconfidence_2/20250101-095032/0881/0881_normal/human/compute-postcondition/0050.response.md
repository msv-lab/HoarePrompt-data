The code `d = not d` changes the value of `d` from its current boolean value to its negated value. Given the initial state, `d` is `True`. Negating `True` results in `False`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 1` if `a >= b`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is `k + 1`, `d` is `False`, `s` is 'BB', `i` is 1**
