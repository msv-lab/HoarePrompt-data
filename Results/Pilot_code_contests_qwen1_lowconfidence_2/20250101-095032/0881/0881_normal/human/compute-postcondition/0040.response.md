Postcondition: ***`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 1` if `a >= b`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is either `0` or `k`, `d` is `True`, `s` is `'B'`, `i` is 1.*** 

Explanation: 
- If `c == k` is true, then `c` is set to `k` and `d` is set to `True`.
- Since there is no else part, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `s`, and `i` remain as they were in the precondition when `c != k`.
