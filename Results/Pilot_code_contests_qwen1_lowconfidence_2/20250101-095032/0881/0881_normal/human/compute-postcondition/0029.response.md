The code `d = not d` changes the value of `d` from its current boolean value to its negation. Given that `d` is initially `False`, it will become `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is 1, `d` is `True`, `s` is 'B', `i` is 0**
