`s` is assigned the value of `s` plus the string `'G'`. Since `s` was initially an empty string, after adding `'G'`, `s` becomes `'G'`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `d` is True, `s` is `'G'`, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `d` is True, `s` is `'G'`, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0.**
