Postcondition: ***`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `d` is True, `s` is an empty string, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0.***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and the if part sets `d` to `True`, the overall postcondition is simply the state defined by the if part, as the else part does not change these variables.
