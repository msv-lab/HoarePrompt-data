The code `d = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `d`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, and `d` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `d` is `True`**
