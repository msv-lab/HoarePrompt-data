The function `func` accepts no parameters directly defined in the given code snippet. However, based on the constraints provided, the function likely uses internal variables or parameters `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` with specific constraints: 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n. The output is not specified in the snippet, but the constraints suggest the function might return some value or perform some operation based on these parameters.

Given the format required, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, a, and b (though not explicitly defined in the function signature), with constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n, and returns a value based on these parameters.**
