The variable `d` is updated to the negation of its current value. Since the initial state says `d` is `True`, after executing `d = not d`, `d` will become `False`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 1, `d` is `False`, `s` is 'G', `i` is 0**
