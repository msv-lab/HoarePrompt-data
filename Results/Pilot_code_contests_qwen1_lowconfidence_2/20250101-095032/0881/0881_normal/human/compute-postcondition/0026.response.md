`b` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `b` is `vals[3]`, so after executing `b -= 1`, the new value of `b` is `vals[3] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is False, `s` is 'B', `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is False, `s` is 'B', `i` is 0**
