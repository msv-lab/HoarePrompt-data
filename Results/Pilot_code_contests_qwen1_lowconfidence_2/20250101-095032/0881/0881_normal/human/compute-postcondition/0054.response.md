The code `print('NO')` prints 'NO' to the console but does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 2` if `a >= b` and `a` was originally `vals[2] - 1`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, `s` is either `'BG'` or `'BB'`, `i` is 1, and the program prints 'NO' to the console.**
