Postcondition: ***`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is `k`, `d` is `False`, `s` is an empty string, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0***

This postcondition includes all the variables from the precondition and updates `c` to be equal to `k` as per the if condition.
