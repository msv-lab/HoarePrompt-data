`s` is initially an empty string, and the code appends 'B' to it. This means `s` will now contain the string 'B'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `d` is False, `s` is 'B', `i` is 0**
