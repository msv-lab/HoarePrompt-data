Postcondition: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 2` if `a >= b` and `a` was originally `vals[2] - 1`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is `0`, `d` is `False`, `s` is `'BG'`. If `a < b`, then `c` remains `0`. If `a >= b`, then `c` becomes `1` if it was `0` initially, or `k + 1` if it was `k` initially.**
