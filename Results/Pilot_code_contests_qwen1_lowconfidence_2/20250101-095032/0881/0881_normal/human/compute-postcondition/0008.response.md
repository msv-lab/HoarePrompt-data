The variable `d` is set to `False`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `b` is greater than `a` also remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, and `b` is greater than `a`.**
