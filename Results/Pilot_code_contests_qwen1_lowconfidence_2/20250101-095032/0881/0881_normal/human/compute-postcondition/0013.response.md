`d` is assigned the value `not d`. Since the initial value of `d` is `False`, `not d` evaluates to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is `k`, `d` is `True`, `s` is an empty string, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0**
