The code `k = vals[1]` assigns the second element of the list `vals` to the variable `k`. Initially, `k` is an integer such that `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5`. After executing this line of code, `k` will take the value of `vals[1]`, which replaces its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is vals[0]; `k` is vals[1]; `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ n; `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ n; and a + b = n**
