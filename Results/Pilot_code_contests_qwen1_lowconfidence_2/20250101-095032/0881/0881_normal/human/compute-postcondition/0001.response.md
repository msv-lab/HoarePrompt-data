`n` is assigned the value of `vals[0]`, which means `n` now holds the first element from the list `vals`. The other variables (`k`, `a`, `b`, and `vals`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is vals[0], `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ n, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ n, and a + b = n; `vals` is a list containing integers entered by the user.**
