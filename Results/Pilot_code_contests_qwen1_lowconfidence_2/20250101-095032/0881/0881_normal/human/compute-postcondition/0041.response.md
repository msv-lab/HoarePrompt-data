The code `s += 'G'` appends the character 'G' to the string `s`. Initially, `s` is `'B'`. After appending 'G', `s` becomes `'BG'`.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) remain unchanged from their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 1` if `a >= b`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is either `0` or `k`, `d` is `True`, `s` is `'BG'`**
