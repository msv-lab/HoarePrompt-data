The code sets `c` to 0. According to the initial state, the value of `c` was `k + 1`. Now, `c` is explicitly set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 1` if `a >= b`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, `s` is 'BB', `i` is 1**
