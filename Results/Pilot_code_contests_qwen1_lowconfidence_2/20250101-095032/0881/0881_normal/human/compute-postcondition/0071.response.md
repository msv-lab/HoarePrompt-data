`c` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `c` was previously `1`, but it is now updated to `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 2` if `a >= b` and `a` was originally `vals[2] - 1`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is `vals[3] - 2`, `c` is `0`, `d` is `False`, `s` is either `'BGB'` or `'BBB'`, `i` is 2.**
