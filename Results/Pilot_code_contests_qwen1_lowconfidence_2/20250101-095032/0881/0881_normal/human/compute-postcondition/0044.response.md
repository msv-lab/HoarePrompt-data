The variable `d` is assigned the value `not d`. Since `d` was initially `True`, `not d` will make `d` become `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 2` if `a >= b` and `a` was originally `vals[2] - 1`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is `1` if `c` was `0` initially, or `k + 1` if `c` was `k` initially, `d` is `False`, `s` is `'BG'`**
