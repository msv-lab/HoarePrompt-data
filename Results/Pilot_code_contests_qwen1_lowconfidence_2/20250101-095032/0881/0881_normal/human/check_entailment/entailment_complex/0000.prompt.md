You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Innokentiy likes tea very much and today he wants to drink exactly n cups of tea. He would be happy to drink more but he had exactly n tea bags, a of them are green and b are black.

Innokentiy doesn't like to drink the same tea (green or black) more than k times in a row. Your task is to determine the order of brewing tea bags so that Innokentiy will be able to drink n cups of tea, without drinking the same tea more than k times in a row, or to inform that it is impossible. Each tea bag has to be used exactly once.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, k, a and b (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — the number of cups of tea Innokentiy wants to drink, the maximum number of cups of same tea he can drink in a row, the number of tea bags of green and black tea. It is guaranteed that a + b = n.

Output

If it is impossible to drink n cups of tea, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, print the string of the length n, which consists of characters 'G' and 'B'. If some character equals 'G', then the corresponding cup of tea should be green. If some character equals 'B', then the corresponding cup of tea should be black.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n.
def func():
    vals = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    n = vals[0]
    k = vals[1]
    a = vals[2]
    b = vals[3]
    c = 0
    d = True
    if (b > a) :
        d = False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, and `d` is `False`, provided that `b` is greater than `a`. There is no alternative outcome since there is no else part in the code.
    s = ''
    for i in range(n):
        if c == k:
            d = not d
            c = 0
        
        if d:
            s += 'G'
            a -= 1
            c += 1
            if a < b:
                d = not d
                c = 0
        else:
            s += 'B'
            b -= 1
            c += 1
            if b < a:
                d = not d
                c = 0
        
        if a < 0 or b < 0:
            print('NO')
            quit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - `n` is `vals[0]`.
    #- `k` is `vals[1]`.
    #- `a` is the final value of `a` after `n` iterations, which could be any non-negative integer depending on the decrement logic.
    #- `b` is the final value of `b` after `n` iterations, which could be any non-negative integer depending on the decrement logic.
    #- `c` is `n`.
    #- `d` is `True` if `b >= a` and `a` is even, `False` otherwise.
    #- `s` is a string consisting of 'G' and 'B' characters, with the exact sequence determined by the loop logic.
    #- The program prints 'NO' and exits if `a < 0` or `b < 0` during any iteration, otherwise it does not print anything.
    #
    #Thus, the output state is:
    print(s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` accepts four integers `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` (with constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n) and generates a string `s` consisting of 'G' and 'B' characters. It alternates between appending 'G' and 'B' based on the values of `a` and `b` and a toggle flag `d`. The function ensures that `a` and `b` do not become negative during the process. If either `a` or `b` becomes negative at any point, the function prints 'NO' and exits. After completing the loop, the function prints the generated string `s`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where `b` is initially greater than `a`, setting `d` to `False` and `c` to `0`.
- The function correctly toggles `d` and resets `c` when either `a` or `b` becomes less than the other.
- If `a` and `b` are both zero initially, the function will still work correctly, as it will simply print an empty string `s`.
- The function does not handle the case where `a` or `b` is zero and `k` is not zero; in such a scenario, the function will print 'NO' and exit because `c` will never reach `k`.
- The function does not account for the possibility that `k` might be larger than `a` or `b`, which would also result in `a` or `b` becoming negative before `c` reaches `k`, leading to the printing of 'NO' and exit.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
