You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Innokentiy likes tea very much and today he wants to drink exactly n cups of tea. He would be happy to drink more but he had exactly n tea bags, a of them are green and b are black.

Innokentiy doesn't like to drink the same tea (green or black) more than k times in a row. Your task is to determine the order of brewing tea bags so that Innokentiy will be able to drink n cups of tea, without drinking the same tea more than k times in a row, or to inform that it is impossible. Each tea bag has to be used exactly once.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, k, a and b (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — the number of cups of tea Innokentiy wants to drink, the maximum number of cups of same tea he can drink in a row, the number of tea bags of green and black tea. It is guaranteed that a + b = n.

Output

If it is impossible to drink n cups of tea, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, print the string of the length n, which consists of characters 'G' and 'B'. If some character equals 'G', then the corresponding cup of tea should be green. If some character equals 'B', then the corresponding cup of tea should be black.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
