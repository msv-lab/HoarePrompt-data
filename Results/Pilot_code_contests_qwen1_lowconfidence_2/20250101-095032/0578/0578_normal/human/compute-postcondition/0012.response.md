The code sets `at_start` to `False`. This updates the value of `at_start`. The values of the other variables (`args`, `file`, `sep`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must be an iterable collection with at least two elements, `file` now contains the string representation of the first element of `args` appended to its previous content, `file` has had `sep` written to it, and the file has now also had `str(x)` written to it.**
