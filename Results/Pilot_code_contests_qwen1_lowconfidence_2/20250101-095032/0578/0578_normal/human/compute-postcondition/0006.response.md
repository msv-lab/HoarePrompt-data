Output State: **`x` is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the initial values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are non-negative integers.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs as long as `y` is non-zero.
   - In each iteration, the values of `x` and `y` are updated using the equation \( x, y = y, x \% y \).

3. **First Iteration:**
   - After the first iteration: `x` becomes `y_initial` and `y` becomes `x_initial % y_initial`.

4. **Second Iteration:**
   - After the second iteration: `x` becomes `y_initial` and `y` becomes `x_initial % y_initial`, which simplifies to `x_initial % y_initial` because `x` now holds the previous `y`.

5. **Third Iteration:**
   - After the third iteration: `x` becomes `x_initial % y_initial` and `y` becomes `y_initial % (x_initial % y_initial)`.

6. **General Pattern:**
   - Each iteration reduces `y` until it eventually becomes zero.
   - When `y` becomes zero, the loop stops.

7. **Final Values:**
   - The final value of `x` is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the initial values of `x` and `y`.
   - The final value of `y` is zero because the loop terminates when `y` becomes zero.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the output state is that `x` is the gcd of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.
