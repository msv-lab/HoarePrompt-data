Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter.
- `i` is 0.
- The condition to check is if the frequency of `group[0]` is greater than or equal to `div`. If true, decrease the frequency of `group[0]` by `div`. Otherwise, keep `group[0]` and `i` unchanged.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The `range` function generates indices starting from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` down to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.
- Given that `i` is currently 0, the loop will start iterating from `i = 0` down to the initial value of `i` specified by the range.

### Current State:
- `i` is 0.
- `group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter.

### Condition for the Next Iteration:
- For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than or equal to the lower bound of the range, which is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`.

### Calculation:
- Let's denote `index_of_group_0` as `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])`.
- The range starts from `index_of_group_0 - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i = 0`.
   - `group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter.

2. **Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will start from `index_of_group_0 - 1` and go down to `-1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than or equal to `index_of_group_0 - 1`.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, it is indeed greater than or equal to `index_of_group_0 - 1`.
   - Therefore, the loop can continue.

4. **New Value of `i`**:
   - On the first iteration of the loop, `i` will be decremented from 0 to -1.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be `-1`.
- `group[0]` remains the same (a valid lowercase letter).

### Conclusion:
State: **`group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter, and `i` is -1**.

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter, and `i` is -1**.
