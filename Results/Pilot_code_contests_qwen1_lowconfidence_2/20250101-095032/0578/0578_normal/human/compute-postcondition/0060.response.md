The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration without executing the subsequent statements in the loop. Since no specific action is taken (other than skipping the remaining part of the loop), the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`group[0]`'s frequency in `freq` is reduced by `rem` unless it is less than `rem`, in which case it remains unchanged; `i` is 0; `rem` is `len(group) % k`; `div` is `len(group) // k`**
