The `break` statement is used to exit a loop, but in this case, there is no loop present in the code snippet. The values of the variables `group[0]` and `i` are not affected by the `break` statement. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter, `i` is -1**
