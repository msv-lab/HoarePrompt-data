Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `args` must be an iterable collection, `file` now contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `\n`. If the keyword argument `'flush'` with a value of `False` is popped from `kwargs`, the function proceeds without any additional changes. Otherwise, the function executes without any specific changes to `args`, `file`, or `kwargs`.***
