Let's break down the task step by step.

### Initial State
- `group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter.
- `i` is -1.
- The condition `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div` will always evaluate to False because `i` is -1 and `string.ascii_lowercase[-1]` is 'z', which has a frequency of 0.

### For Loop Statement
```
for i in range(string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Range Calculation**:
   - The start of the range is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`.
   - The stop of the range is `-1`.
   - The step of the range is `-1`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**:
   - `i` starts from -1 and decrements by 1 until it reaches the stop value of -1.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - Since `i` is -1 initially, the loop will check if `i` can decrement further.
   - As the loop decrements `i`, it will eventually reach -2, -3, ..., until it hits the stop value of -1.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was -1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be -2.
   - The range condition will then evaluate to True, allowing the loop to continue.

### Updated State
- `group[0]` remains a valid lowercase letter.
- `i` needs to be -2 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer
State: **`group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter, `i` is -2**.
