Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `args` must be an iterable collection with at least one element, `file` now contains the string representation of the first two elements of `args` appended to its previous content, followed by `sep` and `str(x)`, and the file has now also had `sep` and `str(x)` written to it. Since the condition `not at_start` is always true in this case, the if part is executed, so the file now additionally contains `sep` written to it.***
