Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `group[0]`'s frequency in `freq` is either `original_frequency - div` if `original_frequency` is greater than or equal to `div`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - `i` is `-1`.
   - `rem` is a non-negative integer.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for group in groups:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each `group` in the `groups` list.
   - The variable `i` starts from `-1` and gets incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` starts from `-1` and gets incremented by 1 for each iteration, at the start of the first iteration, `i` will be `0`.
   - The state of `group[0]`'s frequency in `freq` remains as it was in the previous iteration unless the loop body changes it.
   - `rem` remains a non-negative integer throughout the iterations.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `group[0]`'s frequency in `freq` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (either `original_frequency - div` if `original_frequency >= div`, otherwise unchanged).
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `rem` is still a non-negative integer.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`group[0]'s` frequency in `freq` is either `original_frequency - div` if `original_frequency` is greater than or equal to `div`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `i` is 0, and `rem` is a non-negative integer.**
