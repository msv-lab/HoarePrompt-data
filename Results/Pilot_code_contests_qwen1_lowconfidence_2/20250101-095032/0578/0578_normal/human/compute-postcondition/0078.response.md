The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. The constraints and relationships are defined for variables outside the function scope, but they are not parameters of the function itself. The function does not return any value in two cases and returns -1 in one case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to execute based on certain conditions and return -1 when specified, while not returning anything in other scenarios.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, returns -1 in one case, and does not return any value in other cases.**
