Postcondition: ***`group[0]'s` frequency in `freq` is either `original_frequency - div` if `original_frequency` is greater than or equal to `div`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`, and `rem` is a non-negative integer. The most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
