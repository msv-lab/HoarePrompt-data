The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but rather breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is mentioned, the only impact is that the execution would break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `freq`, `group[0]`, `original_frequency`, `div`, `i`, and `rem` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`group[0]'s` frequency in `freq` is either `original_frequency - div` if original_frequency >= div, otherwise it remains unchanged; `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`; `rem` is a non-negative integer; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
