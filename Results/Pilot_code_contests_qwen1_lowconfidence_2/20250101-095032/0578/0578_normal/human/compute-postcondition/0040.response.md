Postcondition: **`group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter, `freq` is a valid frequency dictionary, `freq[group[0]]` is a positive integer, `rem` is a non-negative integer, there exists at least one index `i` in the range `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` to `-1` such that `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] < rem`, and the current value of `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`.**
