Let's analyze the given Python code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `x` is `y_initial`
   - `y` is `x_initial % y_initial`

2. Code to execute:
   ```python
   x, y = y, x % y
   ```

3. Step-by-step analysis:
   - Before the assignment, `x` is `y_initial` and `y` is `x_initial % y_initial`.
   - The new value of `x` is set to the current value of `y`, which is `x_initial % y_initial`.
   - The new value of `y` is set to `x % y`, which is `y_initial % (x_initial % y_initial)`.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- `x` is now `x_initial % y_initial`
- `y` is now `y_initial % (x_initial % y_initial)`

Output State: **`x` is `x_initial % y_initial`; `y` is `y_initial % (x_initial % y_initial)`**
