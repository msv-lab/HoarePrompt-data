The provided code snippet is `func_3('No')`. However, there is no definition of `func_3` in the initial state description, and the variables `group`, `freq`, and `div`, and `k` are not defined either. Given the lack of context about what `func_3` does, the only variables that are directly mentioned and potentially affected by the code are `i` and `rem`.

Since `func_3` is called with 'No', and without knowing the implementation of `func_3`, we cannot determine what changes, if any, it makes to the variables. The initial state describes that `i` and `rem` might be updated, but since `func_3` is not defined, these variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, as no changes are made by the function call.

Output State: **`group[0]` is a valid character in `string.ascii_lowercase`, `i` is the largest index in `range(string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1, -1, -1)` such that `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is less than `div` if such an index exists, otherwise `i` is -1; the frequency dictionary `freq` remains unchanged, `rem` is `len(group) % k`.**
