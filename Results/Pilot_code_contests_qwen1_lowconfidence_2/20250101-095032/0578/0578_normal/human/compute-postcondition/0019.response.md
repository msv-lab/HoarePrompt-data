`kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` removes the key-value pair with the key 'end' from the `kwargs` dictionary and assigns the value `\n` (if 'end' was not present in `kwargs`) to the `file`. The `file.write()` method writes this value to the file.

- `at_start` remains `False`.
- `args` remains an iterable collection.
- `file` now contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, which is `\n`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must be an iterable collection, `file` now contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `\n`.**
