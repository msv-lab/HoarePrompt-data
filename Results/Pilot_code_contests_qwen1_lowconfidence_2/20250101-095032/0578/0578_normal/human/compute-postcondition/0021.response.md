The `file.flush()` method flushes the internal buffer to the file, but it does not return a value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must be an iterable collection, `file` now contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `\n`, the current value of `kwargs` does not contain the key `'flush'`**
