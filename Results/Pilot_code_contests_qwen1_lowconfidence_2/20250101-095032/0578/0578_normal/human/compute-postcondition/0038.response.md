Postcondition: ***`freq[group[0]]` is reduced by `rem`, `i` is the largest index in `range(string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1, -1, -1)` such that `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is less than `rem` if such an index exists, otherwise `i` is -1; the frequency dictionary `freq` remains unchanged except for the updated value of `freq[group[0]]`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`, and the function returns None. Since the else part is None, this implies that the only case considered is when `div == 0`, hence the postcondition is the same as the if part.***
