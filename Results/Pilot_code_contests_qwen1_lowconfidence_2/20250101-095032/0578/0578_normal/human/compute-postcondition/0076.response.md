Output State: **`freq[group[0]]` is the original frequency of `group[0]` in `s` minus `rem` and then possibly further reduced by `div * (number of times the inner loop executes)`, `i` is -1, `rem` is a non-negative integer, and no changes occur to the frequencies of other characters unless they are between `group[0]` and `'a'` and their frequencies are greater than or equal to `div`, in which case they are decreased by `div` for each occurrence. If `func_3('No')` is called at any point, the function returns without further changes to the variables.**
