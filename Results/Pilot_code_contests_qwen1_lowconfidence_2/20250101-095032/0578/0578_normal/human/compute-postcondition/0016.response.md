The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. Given the initial state, the file already contains the string representation of the first two elements of `args` followed by `sep` and `str(x)`, and the file has also had `sep` and `str(x)` written to it.

Since the condition `not at_start` is always true in this case, the file will now have `sep` written to it again. However, the key point here is that the file already has `sep` and `str(x)` written to it, so writing `sep` and `str(x)` again will not add new unique content, only repeat what is already there.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except the file will have an additional `sep` and `str(x)` appended to it, which is already present.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must be an iterable collection with at least one element, `file` now contains the string representation of the first two elements of `args` appended to its previous content, followed by `sep` and `str(x)`, and the file has now also had `sep` and `str(x)` written to it, and `sep` and `str(x)` have been written to the file again.**
