Postcondition: ***`group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter, and `i` is -1. Since `i` is -1, the condition `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div` will always evaluate to False (as `string.ascii_lowercase[-1]` is 'z' and its frequency is typically 0), hence the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
