The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only causes the exit from the nearest enclosing loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the only affected part is the understanding that the execution would immediately exit if it were inside a loop.

Given the initial state:
- `group[0]` is a valid character in `string.ascii_lowercase`
- `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2` remains unchanged
- `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`
- `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[group[0] - 2]]` is decreased by `div`

The code `break` does not alter these values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`group[0]` is a valid character in `string.ascii_lowercase`, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2` remains unchanged, `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[group[0] - 2]]` is decreased by `div`**
