The `break` statement does not change any variable values; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Given the initial state and the fact that no loop or conditional block is specified in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter, `i` is 0, `freq['a']` is `freq['a'] - div`**
