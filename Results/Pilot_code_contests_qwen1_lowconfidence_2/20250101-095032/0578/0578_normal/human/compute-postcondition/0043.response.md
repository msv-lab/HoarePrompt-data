Postcondition: ***`group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter, `freq` is a valid frequency dictionary, `freq[group[0]]` is a valid positive integer, `rem` is a non-negative integer. For each index `i` in the range `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` to `-1`, if `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` was initially less than `rem` and the condition `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div` holds true, then `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is updated to its original value minus `div`. If no such index `i` satisfies the condition, then the value of `freq[group[0]]` remains unchanged.***
