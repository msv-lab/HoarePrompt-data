The code updates the values of `x` and `y`. Initially, `x` is `y_initial`, and `y` is `x_initial % y_initial` and must be non-zero. After executing `x, y = y, x % y`, the new value of `x` becomes `y_initial`, and the new value of `y` becomes `x_initial % y_initial % y_initial`. Since `y_initial % y_initial` is always 0 (except when `y_initial` is 0), and `y` must be non-zero, the expression simplifies to `x_initial % y_initial`.

Output State: **`x` is `y_initial`, `y` is `x_initial % y_initial`**
