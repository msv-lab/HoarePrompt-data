The function `func_3` is called with the argument `'No'`. However, the exact implementation of `func_3` is not provided, so we cannot determine the specific changes it might make to the variables. Given this information, the only variables that are explicitly mentioned and could potentially be affected are `i` and `rem`, but since no operations are performed on them within the provided snippet, they remain unchanged.

The output state includes the unchanged values of the variables and mentions that the function call does not alter the given variables.

Output State: **`group[0]`'s frequency in `freq` is either `original_frequency - div` if `original_frequency` is greater than or equal to `div`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `rem` is `len(group) % k`, and `div` is `len(group) // k`, and the function `func_3` is called with the argument `'No'`.**
