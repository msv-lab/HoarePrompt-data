Postcondition: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must be an iterable collection, `file` now contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `\n`. The `kwargs` dictionary has been modified by popping the key `'flush'` with a default value of `False`, and the current value of `kwargs` does not contain the key `'flush'`**.
