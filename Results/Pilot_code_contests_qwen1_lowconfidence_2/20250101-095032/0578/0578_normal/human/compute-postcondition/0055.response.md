`rem` is assigned the value of `len(group) % k`. This operation calculates the remainder when the length of `group` is divided by `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`group[0]`'s frequency in `freq` is either `original_frequency - div` if `original_frequency` is greater than or equal to `div`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `rem` is `len(group) % k`, and `div` is `len(group) // k`.**
