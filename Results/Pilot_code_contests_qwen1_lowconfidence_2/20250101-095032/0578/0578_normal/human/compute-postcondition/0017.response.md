The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `at_start`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`**, `args` must be an iterable collection with at least one element, `file` now contains the string representation of the first two elements of `args` appended to its previous content, followed by `sep` and `str(x)`, and the file has now also had `sep` and `str(x)` written to it, and `sep` and `str(x)` have been written to the file again.
