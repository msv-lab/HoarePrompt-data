Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while y:`. This means the loop continues as long as `y` is not zero.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `x` is `y_initial`
   - `y` is `x_initial % y_initial`

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is not zero.
   - In the given state, `y` is `x_initial % y_initial`. Since the modulus operation (`%`) results in a non-zero value as long as `x_initial` is not a multiple of `y_initial`, we know that `y` is not zero initially.

4. **Adjusting the State for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must still be non-zero.
   - Given that `y` is `x_initial % y_initial`, the only way `y` could become zero is if `x_initial` is exactly a multiple of `y_initial` after some iterations.
   - However, since the problem specifies the state at the end of the previous iteration, we assume that `y` is not zero and we need to ensure that the loop can proceed.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - No adjustment is necessary to the current values of `x` and `y` because the loop will continue as long as `y` is non-zero, which it is according to the given state.

**Final State**:
State: **`x` is `y_initial`, `y` is `x_initial % y_initial`**
