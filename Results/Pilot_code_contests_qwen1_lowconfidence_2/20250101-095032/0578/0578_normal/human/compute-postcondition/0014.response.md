The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file `file`. The previous state of `file` contains the string representation of the first two elements of `args` appended to its previous content, followed by `sep` and `str(x)`, and the file has also had `sep` and `str(x)` written to it. After executing this line of code, `file` will have the additional `sep` written to it.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must be an iterable collection with at least one element, `file` now contains the string representation of the first two elements of `args` appended to its previous content, followed by `sep` and `str(x)`, and the file has now also had `sep` written to it.**
