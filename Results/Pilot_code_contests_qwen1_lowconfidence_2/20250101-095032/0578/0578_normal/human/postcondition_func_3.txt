The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y`. After the loop completes, `x` contains the gcd of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is set to 0. This function effectively finds the gcd and normalizes the input such that one of the inputs is zero. Potential edge cases include when either `x` or `y` is zero initially, in which case the gcd is the non-zero value. If both `x` and `y` are zero, the function will still execute the loop but ultimately return `x` (which would be 0) and set `y` to 0. There is no missing functionality as the annotations and the code align correctly.
