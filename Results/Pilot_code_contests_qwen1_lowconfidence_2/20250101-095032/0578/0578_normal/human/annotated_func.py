#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. s and t are strings of length n consisting of lowercase English letters. freq is a dictionary representing the frequency of characters in string s.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `freq[group[0]]` is the original frequency of `group[0]` in `s` minus `rem` and then possibly further reduced by `div * (number of times the inner loop executes)`, `i` is -1, `rem` is a non-negative integer, and no changes occur to the frequencies of other characters unless they are between `group[0]` and `'a'` and their frequencies are greater than or equal to `div`, in which case they are decreased by `div` for each occurrence. If `func_3('No')` is called at any point, the function returns without further changes to the variables.
    func_3('Yes')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two input strings `s` and `t` based on certain conditions. It first reads `n` and `k` from the output of `func_5()`, then reads `s` and `t` from `func_5()` as well. It calculates the frequency of each character in `s` and identifies repeating groups in `t`. For each group, it checks if the frequency of the first character in the group can accommodate the remainder when the group's length is divided by `k`. If not, it calls `func_3('No')` and returns immediately. Otherwise, it attempts to distribute the required frequency reduction among characters in decreasing lexicographical order, starting from the character just before the first character of the group. If no suitable character is found, it also calls `func_3('No')` and returns. If all groups pass these checks, it finally calls `func_3('Yes')`. The function does not return any value in most cases but may return `-1` in specific scenarios, although this seems inconsistent with the provided return postconditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a and b are strings of length n consisting of lowercase English letters; the sum of all n values among all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_2():
    for _ in range(int(func_5())):
        func_1()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `func_5()` must return a positive integer greater than the number of iterations, `func_1()` is called every iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts implicit parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` where `t` is an integer in the range \([1, 10^5]\), `n` and `k` are integers within specified ranges, and `a` and `b` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters. The function iterates `func_5()` times (where `func_5()` returns a positive integer greater than the number of iterations), and during each iteration, it calls `func_1()`. After the loop completes, the function does not return any explicit output. However, it is implied that `func_1()` might modify the strings `a` and `b` or perform some calculations involving `n`, `k`, and the strings. There is no explicit mention of what `func_5()` returns, but it is stated that it must return a positive integer greater than the number of iterations. If `func_5()` returns a value less than or equal to the number of iterations, it would lead to an infinite loop or undefined behavior, which should be handled as an edge case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list where the first element is a list of test case descriptions, and sep, file, end, and flush are keyword arguments with default values. Specifically, sep is a string used to separate the arguments when writing to the file, file is the output stream (defaulting to sys.stdout), end is a string appended after the last argument (defaulting to a newline), and flush is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream (defaulting to False).
def func_3():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `at_start` is `False`, `args` must be an iterable collection, `file` now contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`at_start` is `False`, `args` must be an iterable collection, `file` now contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `\n`. If the keyword argument `'flush'` with a value of `False` is popped from `kwargs`, the function proceeds without any additional changes. Otherwise, the function executes without any specific changes to `args`, `file`, or `kwargs`.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a list of test case descriptions as the first element of `args` and keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` with default values. It writes the test case descriptions to the specified output stream (`sys.stdout` by default), separating each description with the given separator (`' '` by default). After writing all descriptions, it appends the end character (`'\n'` by default) and, if the `flush` flag is set to `True`, it flushes the output stream. The function ensures that the output stream contains the concatenated string representations of all test case descriptions separated by the specified separator and followed by the end character. If the `flush` flag is set to `False`, the function does not perform any additional operations on the output stream.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_4(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the initial values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the initial values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y`. After the loop completes, `x` contains the gcd of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is set to 0. This function effectively finds the gcd and normalizes the input such that one of the inputs is zero. Potential edge cases include when either `x` or `y` is zero initially, in which case the gcd is the non-zero value. If both `x` and `y` are zero, the function will still execute the loop but ultimately return `x` (which would be 0) and set `y` to 0. There is no missing functionality as the annotations and the code align correctly.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, a and b are strings of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
    #`sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')` which reads an input line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace characters
#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), strips any trailing whitespace characters, and returns the resulting string. There are no parameters accepted by this function. The function does not perform any additional operations beyond reading and processing the input line. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing only whitespace, in which case the returned value will still be an empty string after stripping.
