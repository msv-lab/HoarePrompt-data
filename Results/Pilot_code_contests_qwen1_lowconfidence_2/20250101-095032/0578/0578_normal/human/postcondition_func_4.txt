This function reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), strips any trailing whitespace characters, and returns the resulting string. There are no parameters accepted by this function. The function does not perform any additional operations beyond reading and processing the input line. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing only whitespace, in which case the returned value will still be an empty string after stripping.
