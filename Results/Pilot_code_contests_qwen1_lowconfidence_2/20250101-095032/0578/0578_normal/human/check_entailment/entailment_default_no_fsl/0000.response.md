Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle all cases correctly as described in the problem statement.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Group Transformations:**
   - The function `func_1` processes groups in `t` based on the character and its frequency in `s`. However, it assumes that the transformation of groups in `t` can always be achieved by reducing the frequency of characters in `s` through the allowed operations. This is not necessarily true.
   - For example, consider the following case:
     - `n = 4`, `k = 2`
     - `s = "abcd"`
     - `t = "accd"`
   - The group `"cc"` in `t` requires a transformation where both `c` characters become `d`. However, `s` only has one `c` character, so this cannot be achieved.

2. **No Consideration for Edge Cases:**
   - The function does not account for edge cases where the transformations might require more frequent characters in `s` than available.
   - For instance, if `t` has multiple consecutive characters that need to be incremented, but `s` does not have enough of those characters, the function will incorrectly conclude that it is possible.

### Example where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
- `n = 4`, `k = 2`
- `s = "abcd"`
- `t = "accd"`

The group `"cc"` in `t` requires transforming two `c` characters to `d`, but `s` only has one `c` character. Therefore, the program will incorrectly return "Yes" because it does not handle this scenario properly.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that for each group in `t`, the required transformation can be achieved using the characters available in `s` through the allowed operations. This involves checking the frequency of necessary characters in `s` and ensuring they can be distributed correctly.
