You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ashish has two strings a and b, each of length n, and an integer k. The strings only contain lowercase English letters.

He wants to convert string a into string b by performing some (possibly zero) operations on a.

In one move, he can either 

  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i≤ n-1) and swap a_i and a_{i+1}, or 
  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n-k+1) and if a_i, a_{i+1}, …, a_{i+k-1} are all equal to some character c (c ≠ 'z'), replace each one with the next character (c+1), that is, 'a' is replaced by 'b', 'b' is replaced by 'c' and so on. 



Note that he can perform any number of operations, and the operations can only be performed on string a. 

Help Ashish determine if it is possible to convert string a into b after performing some (possibly zero) operations on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n).

The second line of each test case contains the string a of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

The third line of each test case contains the string b of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n among all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case, print "Yes" if Ashish can convert a into b after some moves, else print "No".

You may print the letters of the answer in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


4
3 3
abc
bcd
4 2
abba
azza
2 1
zz
aa
6 2
aaabba
ddddcc


Output


No
Yes
No
Yes

Note

In the first test case it can be shown that it is impossible to convert a into b.

In the second test case,

"abba" \xrightarrow{inc} "acca" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "azza".

Here "swap" denotes an operation of the first type, and "inc" denotes an operation of the second type.

In the fourth test case,

"aaabba" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaabab" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddbb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddcc".

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function processes two input strings `s` and `t` based on certain conditions. It first reads `n` and `k` from the output of `func_5()`, then reads `s` and `t` from `func_5()` as well. It calculates the frequency of each character in `s` and identifies repeating groups in `t`. For each group, it checks if the frequency of the first character in the group can accommodate the remainder when the group's length is divided by `k`. If not, it calls `func_3('No')` and returns immediately. Otherwise, it attempts to distribute the required frequency reduction among characters in decreasing lexicographical order, starting from the character just before the first character of the group. If no suitable character is found, it also calls `func_3('No')` and returns. If all groups pass these checks, it finally calls `func_3('Yes')`. The function does not return any value in most cases but may return `-1` in specific scenarios, although this seems inconsistent with the provided return postconditions.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    for _ in range(int(func_5())):
        func_1()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts implicit parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` where `t` is an integer in the range \([1, 10^5]\), `n` and `k` are integers within specified ranges, and `a` and `b` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters. The function iterates `func_5()` times (where `func_5()` returns a positive integer greater than the number of iterations), and during each iteration, it calls `func_1()`. After the loop completes, the function does not return any explicit output. However, it is implied that `func_1()` might modify the strings `a` and `b` or perform some calculations involving `n`, `k`, and the strings. There is no explicit mention of what `func_5()` returns, but it is stated that it must return a positive integer greater than the number of iterations. If `func_5()` returns a value less than or equal to the number of iterations, it would lead to an infinite loop or undefined behavior, which should be handled as an edge case.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(*args, **kwargs):
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  This function accepts a list of test case descriptions as the first element of `args` and keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` with default values. It writes the test case descriptions to the specified output stream (`sys.stdout` by default), separating each description with the given separator (`' '` by default). After writing all descriptions, it appends the end character (`'\n'` by default) and, if the `flush` flag is set to `True`, it flushes the output stream. The function ensures that the output stream contains the concatenated string representations of all test case descriptions separated by the specified separator and followed by the end character. If the `flush` flag is set to `False`, the function does not perform any additional operations on the output stream.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y`. After the loop completes, `x` contains the gcd of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is set to 0. This function effectively finds the gcd and normalizes the input such that one of the inputs is zero. Potential edge cases include when either `x` or `y` is zero initially, in which case the gcd is the non-zero value. If both `x` and `y` are zero, the function will still execute the loop but ultimately return `x` (which would be 0) and set `y` to 0. There is no missing functionality as the annotations and the code align correctly.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  This function reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), strips any trailing whitespace characters, and returns the resulting string. There are no parameters accepted by this function. The function does not perform any additional operations beyond reading and processing the input line. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing only whitespace, in which case the returned value will still be an empty string after stripping.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
