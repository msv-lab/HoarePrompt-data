You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ashish has two strings a and b, each of length n, and an integer k. The strings only contain lowercase English letters.

He wants to convert string a into string b by performing some (possibly zero) operations on a.

In one move, he can either 

  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i≤ n-1) and swap a_i and a_{i+1}, or 
  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n-k+1) and if a_i, a_{i+1}, …, a_{i+k-1} are all equal to some character c (c ≠ 'z'), replace each one with the next character (c+1), that is, 'a' is replaced by 'b', 'b' is replaced by 'c' and so on. 



Note that he can perform any number of operations, and the operations can only be performed on string a. 

Help Ashish determine if it is possible to convert string a into b after performing some (possibly zero) operations on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n).

The second line of each test case contains the string a of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

The third line of each test case contains the string b of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n among all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case, print "Yes" if Ashish can convert a into b after some moves, else print "No".

You may print the letters of the answer in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


4
3 3
abc
bcd
4 2
abba
azza
2 1
zz
aa
6 2
aaabba
ddddcc


Output


No
Yes
No
Yes

Note

In the first test case it can be shown that it is impossible to convert a into b.

In the second test case,

"abba" \xrightarrow{inc} "acca" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "azza".

Here "swap" denotes an operation of the first type, and "inc" denotes an operation of the second type.

In the fourth test case,

"aaabba" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaabab" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddbb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddcc".

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to account for the case where multiple consecutive characters in `s` need to be incremented by more than one step.

Consider the following test case:
```
4 2
zzz
aaaa
```

### Analysis:
1. **Case Description:**
   - We have `n = 4` and `k = 2`.
   - String `a` is `"zzz"`.
   - String `b` is `"aaaa"`.

2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - To convert `"zzz"` to `"aaaa"`, we need to increment each 'z' to 'a'. Since 'z' is the last letter in the alphabet, we cannot simply increment each 'z' by 1 (since 'a' comes right after 'z'). Instead, we would need to go through the entire alphabet sequence from 'a' to 'z' to get back to 'a'.

3. **Program's Current Logic:**
   - The current logic attempts to increment sequences of characters by finding the longest sequence that starts with the same character and then decrementing by the required steps.
   - For the given test case, the program will attempt to increment from 'z' to 'a' but will fail because it does not properly handle the wrap-around nature of the alphabet.

4. **Failure Scenario:**
   - The program will check the sequence `"zzz"` and see that `k = 2`. It will try to increment each 'z' to 'a' but will not correctly handle the wrap-around from 'z' to 'a'.
   - The program will print "No" because it incorrectly assumes that the increment operation can only be applied once per segment.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle the wrap-around behavior of the alphabet, it fails to provide the correct output for this specific case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. s and t are strings of length n consisting of lowercase English letters. freq is a dictionary representing the frequency of characters in string s.

            if freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div:
                freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] -= div
                break
        else:
            func_3('No')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `freq[group[0]]` is the original frequency of `group[0]` in `s` minus `rem` and then possibly further reduced by `div * (number of times the inner loop executes)`, `i` is -1, `rem` is a non-negative integer, and no changes occur to the frequencies of other characters unless they are between `group[0]` and `'a'` and their frequencies are greater than or equal to `div`, in which case they are decreased by `div` for each occurrence. If `func_3('No')` is called at any point, the function returns without further changes to the variables.
    func_3('Yes')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two input strings `s` and `t` based on certain conditions. It first reads `n` and `k` from the output of `func_5()`, then reads `s` and `t` from `func_5()` as well. It calculates the frequency of each character in `s` and identifies repeating groups in `t`. For each group, it checks if the frequency of the first character in the group can accommodate the remainder when the group's length is divided by `k`. If not, it calls `func_3('No')` and returns immediately. Otherwise, it attempts to distribute the required frequency reduction among characters in decreasing lexicographical order, starting from the character just before the first character of the group. If no suitable character is found, it also calls `func_3('No')` and returns. If all groups pass these checks, it finally calls `func_3('Yes')`. The function does not return any value in most cases but may return `-1` in specific scenarios, although this seems inconsistent with the provided return postconditions.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a and b are strings of length n consisting of lowercase English letters; the sum of all n values among all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_2():
    for _ in range(int(func_5())):
        func_1()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `func_5()` must return a positive integer greater than the number of iterations, `func_1()` is called every iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts implicit parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` where `t` is an integer in the range \([1, 10^5]\), `n` and `k` are integers within specified ranges, and `a` and `b` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters. The function iterates `func_5()` times (where `func_5()` returns a positive integer greater than the number of iterations), and during each iteration, it calls `func_1()`. After the loop completes, the function does not return any explicit output. However, it is implied that `func_1()` might modify the strings `a` and `b` or perform some calculations involving `n`, `k`, and the strings. There is no explicit mention of what `func_5()` returns, but it is stated that it must return a positive integer greater than the number of iterations. If `func_5()` returns a value less than or equal to the number of iterations, it would lead to an infinite loop or undefined behavior, which should be handled as an edge case.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list where the first element is a list of test case descriptions, and sep, file, end, and flush are keyword arguments with default values. Specifically, sep is a string used to separate the arguments when writing to the file, file is the output stream (defaulting to sys.stdout), end is a string appended after the last argument (defaulting to a newline), and flush is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream (defaulting to False).
def func_3():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `at_start` is `False`, `args` must be an iterable collection, `file` now contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`at_start` is `False`, `args` must be an iterable collection, `file` now contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `\n`. If the keyword argument `'flush'` with a value of `False` is popped from `kwargs`, the function proceeds without any additional changes. Otherwise, the function executes without any specific changes to `args`, `file`, or `kwargs`.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a list of test case descriptions as the first element of `args` and keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` with default values. It writes the test case descriptions to the specified output stream (`sys.stdout` by default), separating each description with the given separator (`' '` by default). After writing all descriptions, it appends the end character (`'\n'` by default) and, if the `flush` flag is set to `True`, it flushes the output stream. The function ensures that the output stream contains the concatenated string representations of all test case descriptions separated by the specified separator and followed by the end character. If the `flush` flag is set to `False`, the function does not perform any additional operations on the output stream.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_4(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the initial values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the initial values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y`. After the loop completes, `x` contains the gcd of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is set to 0. This function effectively finds the gcd and normalizes the input such that one of the inputs is zero. Potential edge cases include when either `x` or `y` is zero initially, in which case the gcd is the non-zero value. If both `x` and `y` are zero, the function will still execute the loop but ultimately return `x` (which would be 0) and set `y` to 0. There is no missing functionality as the annotations and the code align correctly.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, a and b are strings of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
    #`sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')` which reads an input line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace characters
#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), strips any trailing whitespace characters, and returns the resulting string. There are no parameters accepted by this function. The function does not perform any additional operations beyond reading and processing the input line. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing only whitespace, in which case the returned value will still be an empty string after stripping.
