You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ashish has two strings a and b, each of length n, and an integer k. The strings only contain lowercase English letters.

He wants to convert string a into string b by performing some (possibly zero) operations on a.

In one move, he can either 

  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i≤ n-1) and swap a_i and a_{i+1}, or 
  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n-k+1) and if a_i, a_{i+1}, …, a_{i+k-1} are all equal to some character c (c ≠ 'z'), replace each one with the next character (c+1), that is, 'a' is replaced by 'b', 'b' is replaced by 'c' and so on. 



Note that he can perform any number of operations, and the operations can only be performed on string a. 

Help Ashish determine if it is possible to convert string a into b after performing some (possibly zero) operations on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n).

The second line of each test case contains the string a of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

The third line of each test case contains the string b of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n among all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case, print "Yes" if Ashish can convert a into b after some moves, else print "No".

You may print the letters of the answer in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


4
3 3
abc
bcd
4 2
abba
azza
2 1
zz
aa
6 2
aaabba
ddddcc


Output


No
Yes
No
Yes

Note

In the first test case it can be shown that it is impossible to convert a into b.

In the second test case,

"abba" \xrightarrow{inc} "acca" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "azza".

Here "swap" denotes an operation of the first type, and "inc" denotes an operation of the second type.

In the fourth test case,

"aaabba" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaabab" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddbb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddcc".

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to account for the case where multiple consecutive characters in `s` need to be incremented by more than one step.

Consider the following test case:
```
4 2
zzz
aaaa
```

### Analysis:
1. **Case Description:**
   - We have `n = 4` and `k = 2`.
   - String `a` is `"zzz"`.
   - String `b` is `"aaaa"`.

2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - To convert `"zzz"` to `"aaaa"`, we need to increment each 'z' to 'a'. Since 'z' is the last letter in the alphabet, we cannot simply increment each 'z' by 1 (since 'a' comes right after 'z'). Instead, we would need to go through the entire alphabet sequence from 'a' to 'z' to get back to 'a'.

3. **Program's Current Logic:**
   - The current logic attempts to increment sequences of characters by finding the longest sequence that starts with the same character and then decrementing by the required steps.
   - For the given test case, the program will attempt to increment from 'z' to 'a' but will fail because it does not properly handle the wrap-around nature of the alphabet.

4. **Failure Scenario:**
   - The program will check the sequence `"zzz"` and see that `k = 2`. It will try to increment each 'z' to 'a' but will not correctly handle the wrap-around from 'z' to 'a'.
   - The program will print "No" because it incorrectly assumes that the increment operation can only be applied once per segment.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle the wrap-around behavior of the alphabet, it fails to provide the correct output for this specific case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 5 : This function reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), strips any trailing whitespace characters, and returns the resulting string. There are no parameters accepted by this function. The function does not perform any additional operations beyond reading and processing the input line. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing only whitespace, in which case the returned value will still be an empty string after stripping.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
