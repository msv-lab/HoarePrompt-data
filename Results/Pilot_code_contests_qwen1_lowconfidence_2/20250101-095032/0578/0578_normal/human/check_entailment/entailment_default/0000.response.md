Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to convert string `a` into string `b` using the allowed operations. Specifically, the function `func_1` incorrectly checks the feasibility of converting `s` to `t` rather than checking if `a` can be converted to `b`.

The function `func_1` performs several operations:
1. It reads `n` and `k` from the input.
2. It reads strings `s` and `t`.
3. It checks if the frequency of each character in `s` can accommodate the transformation of `t` according to the rules described.

However, the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the operations allowed on `a` to transform it into `b`. Instead, it tries to verify if `t` can be transformed into `s`, which is not the same as transforming `a` into `b`.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4 2
aaabba
ddddcc
```
The correct approach would be to check if `a` can be transformed into `b` using the allowed operations. The provided code does not perform this check correctly.

To fix this, the code needs to simulate the operations on `a` to see if it can match `b`. Specifically, it should:
1. Try swapping adjacent characters in `a` to match the characters in `b`.
2. Increment characters in `a` to match the corresponding characters in `b` if possible.

Since the provided code does not implement this logic, it is incorrect.
