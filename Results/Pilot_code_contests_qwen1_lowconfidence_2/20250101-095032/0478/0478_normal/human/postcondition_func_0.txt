This function accepts a variable number of arguments (`args`), an optional keyword argument `sep` for specifying the separator between arguments, an optional keyword argument `file` for specifying the output file (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), an optional keyword argument `end` for specifying the string appended after the last argument (defaulting to a newline), and an optional keyword argument `flush` for flushing the stream after writing. The function writes the elements of `args`, separated by `sep`, to `file`, followed by `end`. If `flush` is set to `True`, the stream is flushed after writing. After executing the function, `file` contains the concatenated strings from `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `args` is empty, no output is produced. Edge cases include handling when `args` is empty, and ensuring that `kwargs` does not contain unnecessary keys after processing.
