Postcondition: ***`num` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, `even_digits` is a deque, and `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed. `ret` is a list that either contains the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits` depending on the condition: if `odd_digits` is empty or if the first element of `even_digits` is smaller than the first element of `odd_digits`, `ret` contains the first element of `even_digits`; otherwise, `ret` contains the first element of `odd_digits`.***
