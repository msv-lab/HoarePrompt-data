The code appends a `digit` to the `odd_digits` deque. The initial state indicates that `num` is a non-empty list of integers (one element shorter), `even_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next even digit, and `odd_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next odd digit. After appending the `digit` to `odd_digits`, the `odd_digits` deque will contain the original contents plus the new `digit`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-empty list of integers (one element shorter), `even_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next even digit, `odd_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next odd digit and the newly appended `digit`.**
