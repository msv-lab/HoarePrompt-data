The code `ret.append(odd_digits.popleft())` appends the first element of `odd_digits` (which is a deque) to the list `ret`. Since `odd_digits` is a deque and its first element is removed using `popleft`, the updated states of the variables are:

- `num` remains a non-empty list with at least 2 elements.
- `even_digits` remains a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared.
- `odd_digits` remains a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed, but now it has one less element.
- `ret` is a list containing the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits` depending on the condition, and now it includes the first element of `odd_digits` that was just removed.

Output State: **`num` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared, `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed and one less element, `ret` is a list containing either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits` depending on the condition, and the first element of `odd_digits` is appended to `ret`.**
