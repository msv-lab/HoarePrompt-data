State before the loop starts: `num` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the original string `num`; `even_digits` is an empty deque; `odd_digits` is an empty deque.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num` list. The loop will execute if the `num` list has at least one element. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `digit` in the loop will take the value of each element in the list `num` one by one.
2. For the loop to start, the list `num` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `num` is not empty.

State: **`num` is a non-empty list of integers, `even_digits` is an empty deque, `odd_digits` is an empty deque**
