The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a string representing a huge integer without leading zeros except possibly for the case where the entire number is '0'. Additionally, it accepts two deques, `even_digits` and `odd_digits`, which contain the even and odd digits of the integer respectively.

The function returns an empty string since `ret` is an empty list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `num`, along with two deques `even_digits` and `odd_digits`, and return an empty string.
