The code snippet converts each character in the string `num` into its corresponding integer value using the expression `(ord(x) - ord('0'))`. This operation transforms `num` from a string of digits into a list of integers.

Given that `num` initially is a string representing a huge integer without leading zeros (except possibly for the case where the entire number is '0'), the transformation will result in a list of integers where each element is the integer representation of the corresponding digit in `num`.

Therefore, after executing the code, `num` will be a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the original string.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the original string `num`; `even_digits` and `odd_digits` are unchanged deques containing even and odd digits of the integer respectively.**
