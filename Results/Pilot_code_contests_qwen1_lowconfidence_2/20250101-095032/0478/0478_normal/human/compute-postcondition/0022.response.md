The code appends the first element of `odd_digits` (which is a deque) to the `ret` list. Since `odd_digits` is a deque, the first element is removed from `odd_digits` and added to `ret`.

Given the precondition that `odd_digits` is not empty or the first element of `even_digits` is greater than or equal to the first element of `odd_digits`, the condition for executing this line of code is satisfied.

After executing the line `ret.append(odd_digits.popleft())`:
- `ret` will contain the first element of `odd_digits`.
- `odd_digits` will be updated by removing its first element.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`num` is a non-empty list, `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared, `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed, `ret` is a list containing the first element of `odd_digits`, either `odd_digits` is not empty or the first element of `even_digits` is greater than or equal to the first element of `odd_digits` after the operation.**
