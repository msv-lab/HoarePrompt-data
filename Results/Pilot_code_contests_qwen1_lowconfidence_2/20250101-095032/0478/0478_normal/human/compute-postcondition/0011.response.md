Postcondition: **`num` is a non-empty list of integers, `even_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next even digit, and `odd_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next odd digit. If the `digit` is even, `even_digits` has the `digit` appended to it. If the `digit` is odd, `odd_digits` contains the next odd digit (or the previously contained odd digits plus the new digit).**
