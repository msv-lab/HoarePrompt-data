Output State: **`num` is an empty list, `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared, and `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations of the loop, the `num` list will be empty because each digit is removed from `num` as it is processed.
- If the loop executed at least once, `even_digits` will contain all even digits from the original `num` list, and `odd_digits` will contain all odd digits from the original `num` list. The order in which they appear in the respective deques is the same as their order in the original `num` list.

If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `num` is an empty list to begin with), then:
- `num` remains an empty list.
- `even_digits` remains an empty deque.
- `odd_digits` remains an empty deque.
