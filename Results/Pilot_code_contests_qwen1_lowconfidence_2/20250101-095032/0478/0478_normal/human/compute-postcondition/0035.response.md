Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a string `num` representing a huge integer without leading zeros (except possibly for the entire number being '0'), and two deques `even_digits` and `odd_digits` containing the even and odd digits of the integer, respectively. It processes these inputs by first converting `num` into a list of integers, then separating even and odd digits into the respective deques. Next, it constructs a new list `ret` by alternating between the first elements of `even_digits` and `odd_digits` until one of the deques is exhausted. Finally, it returns an empty string since `ret` is converted to a string and returned.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `num` is an empty string or consists only of '0', the function will still execute as expected, resulting in an empty list `ret` and an empty string as the return value.
- If `even_digits` and `odd_digits` are both empty, the function will still execute the for loop, ensuring that `ret` remains empty and an empty string is returned.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations and code indicate that the function should return an empty string, but the initial comment suggests that the function returns an empty string based on `ret` being empty. This is correct, as `ret` is indeed constructed to be empty by the end of the function, but the annotation incorrectly states that the function returns an empty string because `num` is empty. This is misleading; the actual reason for returning an empty string is that `ret` is empty.
