Postcondition: ***`num` is a non-empty list of integers, `even_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the current even digit, and `odd_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the odd integer `digit`. The digit currently being processed is either even, in which case it is added to `even_digits`, or it is odd, in which case it is added to `odd_digits`.***
