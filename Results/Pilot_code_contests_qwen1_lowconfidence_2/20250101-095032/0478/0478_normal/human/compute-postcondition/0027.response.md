Postcondition: ***`num` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared, and `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed. `ret` is a list that either contains the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits` depending on the condition. If `even_digits[0] < odd_digits[0]` or `odd_digits` is empty, `ret` includes the first element of `even_digits`; otherwise, `ret` includes the first element of `odd_digits`.***
