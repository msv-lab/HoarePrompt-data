Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements.
   - `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared.
   - `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed.
   - `ret` is a list that either contains the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits` depending on the condition.

2. **Condition for the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for each element in `num`, so it continues as long as there are elements left in `num`.

3. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs based on the length of `num`, and `num` must have at least 2 elements initially, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must still have at least one element.
   - After each iteration, the first element of `num` is processed, but `num` itself does not change in size (it is assumed that the processing inside the loop does not alter the size of `num`).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `num` must still have at least one element.
   - `even_digits` remains a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared.
   - `odd_digits` remains a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed.
   - `ret` is updated based on the condition, but since we don't know the exact value, we keep it as it was after the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared, `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed, `ret` is a list that either contains the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits` depending on the condition.**
