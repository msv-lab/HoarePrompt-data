According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digit`. For each iteration of the loop, the loop processes the next digit in the list `num`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `num` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `even_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the current even digit.
- `odd_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the odd integer `digit`.
- The digit currently being processed is either even or odd.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to process the next digit in the list `num`. Therefore:
- `num` remains a non-empty list of integers (since it still has more digits to process).
- `even_digits` or `odd_digits` will be updated based on the next digit's parity (even or odd).

Let's break it down step by step:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, the digit currently being processed was either even or odd.
2. For the next iteration, the next digit in `num` will be processed.
3. If the next digit is even, it will be added to `even_digits`.
4. If the next digit is odd, it will be added to `odd_digits`.

Since we do not know the parity of the next digit, we consider both possibilities:
- If the next digit is even, `even_digits` will contain the new even digit.
- If the next digit is odd, `odd_digits` will contain the new odd digit.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `num` remains a non-empty list of integers.
- `even_digits` or `odd_digits` will be updated based on the parity of the next digit.

State: **`num` is a non-empty list of integers, `even_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next even digit, and `odd_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next odd digit.**
