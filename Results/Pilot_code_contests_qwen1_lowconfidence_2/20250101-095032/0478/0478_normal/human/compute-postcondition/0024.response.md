Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `num` is a non-empty list.
- `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared.
- `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed.
- `ret` is a list containing either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits` depending on the condition.
- `odd_digits` is not empty or the first element of `even_digits` is greater than or equal to the first element of `odd_digits`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(len(num)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the length of `num`.
- Since `num` is a non-empty list, the length of `num` is at least 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the new state of the variables at the start of the next iteration.

### Adjusting the States:
1. **`num`**: The length of `num` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
2. **`even_digits`**: Since the loop does not modify `even_digits`, it remains unchanged.
3. **`odd_digits`**: Since the loop does not modify `odd_digits`, it remains unchanged.
4. **`ret`**: The value of `ret` could change based on the condition inside the loop. However, since we don't know the exact condition, we can't determine the exact value of `ret` without the loop body. But we can say that `ret` will be updated based on the condition.

Given that the only thing that changes is the iteration count, and assuming the condition inside the loop holds true for the next iteration, the key variable that affects the loop continuation is the length of `num`.

### New State:
- The length of `num` decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `num` should be greater than 1.

Since the loop iterates over the length of `num`, and we need the loop to execute one more time, the length of `num` must be at least 2.

### Final State:
- `num` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements.
- `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared.
- `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed.
- `ret` is a list containing either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits` depending on the condition.
- `odd_digits` is not empty or the first element of `even_digits` is greater than or equal to the first element of `odd_digits`.

State: **`num` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared, `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed, `ret` is a list containing either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits` depending on the condition, and `odd_digits` is not empty or the first element of `even_digits` is greater than or equal to the first element of `odd_digits`.**
