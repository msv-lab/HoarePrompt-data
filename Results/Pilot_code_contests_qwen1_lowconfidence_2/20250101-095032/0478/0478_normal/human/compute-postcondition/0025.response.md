The code appends the first element of `even_digits` to `ret` and removes this element from `even_digits`. The value of `even_digits` changes because its first element is removed, while `odd_digits` remains unchanged. `ret` gets a new element, which is the first element of `even_digits`.

Since `odd_digits` is not empty and the first element of `even_digits` is greater than or equal to the first element of `odd_digits`, the condition for `ret` being the first element of `even_digits` or `odd_digits` remains valid.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `num` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements (unchanged).
- `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared, except its first element (since it was appended to `ret` and removed).
- `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed (unchanged).
- `ret` contains either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits` depending on the condition, and now includes one additional element, the first element of `even_digits` that was just appended.

Output State: **`num` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared, except its first element, `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed, `ret` is a list containing either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits` depending on the condition, and `ret` now includes the first element of `even_digits` that was appended.**
