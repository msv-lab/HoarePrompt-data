The code appends the current digit to the `even_digits` deque. Since the digit currently being processed is even, it will be added to the `even_digits` deque. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a non-empty list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque containing the current even digit, `odd_digits` is an empty deque, the digit currently being processed is even**
