Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `num` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `even_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next even digit.
- `odd_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next odd digit.

Given the for loop:
```python
for digit in num:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Values:**
   - `num` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `even_digits` contains either the next even digit or is empty.
   - `odd_digits` contains either the next odd digit or is empty.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each `digit` in `num`.
   - If `digit` is even, it is appended to `even_digits`.
   - If `digit` is odd, `odd_digits` gets updated to include this new odd digit.

3. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - After processing one digit, the remaining list of integers in `num` is one element shorter.
   - The value of `even_digits` might have changed based on whether the current digit was even or odd.
   - The value of `odd_digits` might have changed similarly.

### Updated States:
- `num` will now be a non-empty list (one element shorter) because one digit has been processed.
- `even_digits` will contain the next even digit if the current digit was even, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- `odd_digits` will contain the next odd digit if the current digit was odd, otherwise it remains unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`num` is a non-empty list of integers (one element shorter), `even_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next even digit, and `odd_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next odd digit.**

This reflects that after processing one digit from `num`, the list `num` is one element shorter, while `even_digits` and `odd_digits` are updated based on the parity of the current digit.
