The code appends a `digit` to the `odd_digits` deque. Since the initial state specifies that `odd_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next odd digit, after appending a digit, `odd_digits` will now contain the next odd digit if it was empty, or will append the new digit to the existing elements in `odd_digits`. The `num` and `even_digits` variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a non-empty list of integers, `odd_digits` contains the next odd digit (or the previously contained odd digits plus the new digit), and `even_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next even digit.**
