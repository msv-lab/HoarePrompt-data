According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `len(num)` is at least 1. The loop variable `_` will iterate over the range of indices from 0 to `len(num) - 1`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`num`**: It should have at least one element for the loop to execute. If `num` is empty, the loop won't run.
2. **`even_digits` and `odd_digits`**: These deques are constructed based on the contents of `num`. However, their contents do not affect whether the loop executes. They are only used within the loop body.
3. **`ret`**: This list is not relevant to the loop execution itself but may be modified during the loop iterations.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `num` contains at least one element. Therefore, we adjust `num` to have at least one element.

State: **`num` is a non-empty list (must contain at least one element), `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared, `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared, `ret` is an empty list**
