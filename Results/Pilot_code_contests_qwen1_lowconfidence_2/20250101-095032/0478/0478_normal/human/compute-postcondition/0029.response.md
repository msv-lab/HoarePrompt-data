The code appends the first element of `even_digits` to `ret` and removes this element from `even_digits`. Given the initial conditions:

- `num` is a non-empty list with at least one element.
- `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared.
- `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed.
- `ret` is a list that either contains the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits` depending on the condition.

After running the code `ret.append(even_digits.popleft())`:

- The first element of `even_digits` is appended to `ret`.
- This element is also removed from `even_digits`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `num` remains unchanged.
- `even_digits` loses its first element.
- `odd_digits` remains unchanged.
- `ret` now includes the first element of `even_digits`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, `even_digits` is a deque with its first element removed, `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed, `ret` is a list containing the first element of `even_digits` appended to it.**
