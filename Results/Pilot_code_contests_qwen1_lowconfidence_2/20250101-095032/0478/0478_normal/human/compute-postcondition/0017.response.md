The code initializes an empty list `ret`. This does not affect the values of `num`, `even_digits`, or `odd_digits`. The only change is the creation of the `ret` list.

Output State: **`num` is an empty list, `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared, and `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared; `ret` is an empty list**
