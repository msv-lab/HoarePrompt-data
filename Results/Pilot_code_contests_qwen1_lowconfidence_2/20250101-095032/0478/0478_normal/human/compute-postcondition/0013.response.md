The code appends a `digit` to the `even_digits` deque. The initial state indicates that `num` is a non-empty list of integers (one element shorter), `even_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next even digit, and `odd_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next odd digit.

After executing the line `even_digits.append(digit)`, the `even_digits` deque will have one more element, which is the `digit`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a non-empty list of integers (one element shorter), `even_digits` is a deque containing the next even digit and the appended `digit`, and `odd_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next odd digit.**
