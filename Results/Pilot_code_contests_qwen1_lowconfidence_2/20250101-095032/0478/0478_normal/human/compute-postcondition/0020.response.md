The code appends the first element of `even_digits` to `ret` using `popleft()`, which removes this element from `even_digits`. This means `even_digits` loses its first element, and `ret` gains a new element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the precondition:
- `num` is a non-empty list.
- `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared.
- `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared.
- `ret` is an empty list.
- The deque `even_digits` is not empty or the deque `odd_digits` is empty, or the first element of `even_digits` is smaller than the first element of `odd_digits`.

After the code executes, the output state is:
- `num` remains unchanged.
- `even_digits` loses its first element.
- `odd_digits` remains unchanged.
- `ret` is now a list with the first element of `even_digits` appended to it.
- The condition that `even_digits` is not empty or `odd_digits` is empty, or the first element of `even_digits` is smaller than the first element of `odd_digits` remains valid.

Output State: **`num` is a non-empty list, `even_digits` is a deque with one less element, `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared, `ret` is a list with the first element of `even_digits` appended to it, the deque `even_digits` is not empty or the deque `odd_digits` is empty, or the first element of `even_digits` is smaller than the first element of `odd_digits`**.
