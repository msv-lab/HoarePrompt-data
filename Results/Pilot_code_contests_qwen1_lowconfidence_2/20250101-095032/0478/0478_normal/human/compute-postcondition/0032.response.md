Output State: **`num` is an empty list, `even_digits` is an empty deque, `odd_digits` is an empty deque, `ret` is a list containing all elements from the original `num` list in the order they appeared, such that each element is either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits` depending on the condition.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues until `num` becomes an empty list. Once `num` is empty, the loop terminates.
- During each iteration, the loop pops either the first element from `even_digits` or `odd_digits` based on the condition `if not odd_digits or even_digits and even_digits[0] < odd_digits[0]`. This ensures that `ret` accumulates elements from `even_digits` if the condition is met or from `odd_digits` otherwise.
- After all elements from `num` are processed, `num` becomes an empty list, `even_digits` and `odd_digits` also become empty deques, and `ret` contains all elements from the original `num` list in the order they appeared, following the logic described by the loop condition.
