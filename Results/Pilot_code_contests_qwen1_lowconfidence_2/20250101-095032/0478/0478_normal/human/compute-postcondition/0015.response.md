Postcondition: ***`num` is a non-empty list of integers (one element shorter). `even_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next even digit, and `odd_digits` is either an empty deque or contains the next odd digit. Specifically, if the `digit` is even, `even_digits` will contain this digit along with any existing even digits, and `odd_digits` will remain unchanged. If the `digit` is odd, `even_digits` will remain unchanged, and `odd_digits` will contain this digit along with any existing odd digits.***
