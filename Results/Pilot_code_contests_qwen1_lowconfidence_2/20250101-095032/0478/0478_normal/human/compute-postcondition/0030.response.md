The code appends the first element of `odd_digits` to `ret`. Since `odd_digits` is a deque with its first element removed, it now contains one less element than before. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's denote the first element of `odd_digits` as `first_odd`.

- `num` remains a non-empty list with at least 1 element.
- `even_digits` remains a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared.
- `odd_digits` remains a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed.
- `ret` now includes the first element of `odd_digits`, which is `first_odd`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element; `even_digits` is a deque containing all even digits from the original `num` list in the order they appeared; `odd_digits` is a deque containing all odd digits from the original `num` list with its first element removed; `ret` is a list that includes the first element of `odd_digits`, which is `first_odd`.**
