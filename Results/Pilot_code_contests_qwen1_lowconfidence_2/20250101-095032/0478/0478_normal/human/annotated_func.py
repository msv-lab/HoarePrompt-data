#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^4. Each test case consists of a string a representing a huge integer consisting of n digits (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), where n is the length of the string a. The integer a may contain leading zeros.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is `False`, `file` contains the concatenated strings from `args` separated by `sep`.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is `False`, `file` contains the concatenated strings from `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `'\n'`, `kwargs` does not contain the key 'end'. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `False`, the postcondition remains the same.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a variable number of arguments (`args`), an optional keyword argument `sep` for specifying the separator between arguments, an optional keyword argument `file` for specifying the output file (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), an optional keyword argument `end` for specifying the string appended after the last argument (defaulting to a newline), and an optional keyword argument `flush` for flushing the stream after writing. The function writes the elements of `args`, separated by `sep`, to `file`, followed by `end`. If `flush` is set to `True`, the stream is flushed after writing. After executing the function, `file` contains the concatenated strings from `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `args` is empty, no output is produced. Edge cases include handling when `args` is empty, and ensuring that `kwargs` does not contain unnecessary keys after processing.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a string representing a huge integer (consisting of n digits where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) without leading zeros except possibly for the case where the entire number is '0'. even_digits and odd_digits are dequeues containing even and odd digits of the integer respectively.

    return ''.join(map(str, ret))
    #The program returns an empty string since `ret` is an empty list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `num` representing a huge integer without leading zeros (except possibly for the entire number being '0'), and two deques `even_digits` and `odd_digits` containing the even and odd digits of the integer, respectively. It processes these inputs by first converting `num` into a list of integers, then separating even and odd digits into the respective deques. Next, it constructs a new list `ret` by alternating between the first elements of `even_digits` and `odd_digits` until one of the deques is exhausted. Finally, it returns an empty string since `ret` is converted to a string and returned.
