Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_2` does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the function does not ensure that adjacent swaps of different parity digits are performed optimally to achieve the minimum possible integer. Here’s an example that demonstrates the issue:

Consider the input `210`. According to the problem description, we can swap the digits at positions 1 and 2 (since they are of different parity), resulting in `102`, which is the smallest possible integer we can achieve. However, the current implementation might not perform this swap, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate, let's walk through the steps with `210`:
- Original: `210`
- Swap 1st and 2nd digits: `102`

The function should produce `102` as the output, but the current implementation might not do so due to its logic.

Here’s how the function processes `210`:
- Convert each character to an integer: `[2, 1, 0]`
- Separate even and odd digits:
  - Even: `[2]`
  - Odd: `[1]`
- Attempt to construct the result:
  - For the first position, since there is an even digit, it will take the even digit: `[2]`
  - For the second position, since there is no even digit left, it takes the odd digit: `[1]`
  - For the third position, since there is no odd digit left, it takes the remaining even digit: `[0]`

Thus, the result would be `210` instead of `102`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the output for the input `210` should be `102`, but the provided function does not guarantee this behavior. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
