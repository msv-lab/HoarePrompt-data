Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_2` still does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the function does not ensure that adjacent swaps of different parity digits are performed optimally to achieve the minimum possible integer. Let's re-examine the function `func_2` with the provided annotated version:

```python
def func_2(num):
    num = [(ord(x) - ord('0')) for x in num]
    even_digits, odd_digits = collections.deque(), collections.deque()
    for digit in num:
        if digit & 1 == 0:
            even_digits.append(digit)
        else:
            odd_digits.append(digit)
    
    ret = []
    for _ in range(len(num)):
        if not odd_digits or (even_digits and even_digits[0] < odd_digits[0]):
            ret.append(even_digits.popleft())
        else:
            ret.append(odd_digits.popleft())
    
    return ''.join(map(str, ret))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `num` is converted to a list of integers.
   - `even_digits` and `odd_digits` deques are initialized to store even and odd digits respectively.

2. **Digit Classification**:
   - Digits are classified into `even_digits` and `odd_digits` based on their parity.

3. **Reconstruction**:
   - A list `ret` is constructed by iterating over the length of `num`.
   - In each iteration, the function decides whether to pop from `even_digits` or `odd_digits` based on the condition:
     - If `odd_digits` is empty or the front of `even_digits` is smaller than the front of `odd_digits`, it pops from `even_digits`.
     - Otherwise, it pops from `odd_digits`.

### Issues:
1. **Optimal Swapping**:
   - The current implementation does not guarantee that the smallest possible integer is formed. It only ensures that each digit in the result is either the smallest even or the smallest odd at the current step, but it does not consider the global optimal solution.

2. **Example Revisited**:
   - Consider the input `210`:
     - `num` becomes `[2, 1, 0]`.
     - `even_digits` becomes `[2]`.
     - `odd_digits` becomes `[1]`.
     - After reconstruction, `ret` becomes `[2, 1, 0]` instead of `[1, 0, 2]`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To achieve the minimum integer, we need to consider the smallest possible digit at each position by considering the parity and the overall structure of the number.

Given these observations, the provided function `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic to form the minimum possible integer. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final assessment remains:

Final: **False**
