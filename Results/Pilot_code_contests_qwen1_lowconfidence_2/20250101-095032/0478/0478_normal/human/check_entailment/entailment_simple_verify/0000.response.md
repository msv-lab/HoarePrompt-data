Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to swap adjacent digits of different parity to minimize the integer. The annotated version clearly shows that the function `func_2` sorts the digits such that even digits come before odd digits, but it does not consider the relative order of even and odd digits to achieve the smallest possible integer. 

For example, for the input "246432":
- The function sorts the digits as "244632" instead of achieving "234642".
- The function does not take into account the relative order of even and odd digits to ensure that the smallest possible integer is achieved.

The provided code fails to handle the scenario where multiple even and odd digits are present and needs to ensure that the smallest possible integer is formed by moving smaller even and odd digits to the front while maintaining their relative order within even and odd groups. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being False is accurate.
