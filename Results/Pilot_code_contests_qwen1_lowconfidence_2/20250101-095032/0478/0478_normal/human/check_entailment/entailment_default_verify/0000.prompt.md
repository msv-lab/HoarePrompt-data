You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a huge integer a consisting of n digits (n is between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5, inclusive). It may contain leading zeros.

You can swap two digits on adjacent (neighboring) positions if the swapping digits are of different parity (that is, they have different remainders when divided by 2). 

For example, if a = 032867235 you can get the following integers in a single operation: 

  * 302867235 if you swap the first and the second digits; 
  * 023867235 if you swap the second and the third digits; 
  * 032876235 if you swap the fifth and the sixth digits; 
  * 032862735 if you swap the sixth and the seventh digits; 
  * 032867325 if you swap the seventh and the eighth digits. 



Note, that you can't swap digits on positions 2 and 4 because the positions are not adjacent. Also, you can't swap digits on positions 3 and 4 because the digits have the same parity.

You can perform any number (possibly, zero) of such operations.

Find the minimum integer you can obtain.

Note that the resulting integer also may contain leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the input.

The only line of each test case contains the integer a, its length n is between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5, inclusive.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all values n does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print line — the minimum integer you can obtain.

Example

Input


3
0709
1337
246432


Output


0079
1337
234642

Note

In the first test case, you can perform the following sequence of operations (the pair of swapped digits is highlighted): 0 \underline{70} 9 → 0079.

In the second test case, the initial integer is optimal. 

In the third test case you can perform the following sequence of operations: 246 \underline{43} 2 → 24 \underline{63}42 → 2 \underline{43} 642 → 234642.

            ret.append(even_digits.popleft())
        else:
            ret.append(odd_digits.popleft())
    return ''.join(map(str, ret))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to swap adjacent digits of different parity to minimize the integer. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where multiple even and odd digits are present, and it does not ensure that the minimum possible integer is achieved.

Consider the input "246432":
- The program sorts the digits such that even digits come before odd digits, but it does not consider the relative order of even and odd digits to achieve the smallest possible integer.
- The correct approach would involve swapping adjacent digits to move smaller even and odd digits to the front while maintaining their relative order within even and odd groups.

For example, for the input "246432", the correct minimum integer should be "234642", but the provided function does not achieve this. The function simply interleaves the even and odd digits without considering the relative order, which might not always yield the minimum possible integer.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a string `num` representing a huge integer without leading zeros (except possibly for the entire number being '0'), and two deques `even_digits` and `odd_digits` containing the even and odd digits of the integer, respectively. It processes these inputs by first converting `num` into a list of integers, then separating even and odd digits into the respective deques. Next, it constructs a new list `ret` by alternating between the first elements of `even_digits` and `odd_digits` until one of the deques is exhausted. Finally, it returns an empty string since `ret` is converted to a string and returned.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
