Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the problem's requirements for performing adjacent swaps of different parity digits to achieve the minimum possible integer. As illustrated with the example input `210`, the function does not guarantee the optimal swaps to produce the smallest possible integer. Instead of ensuring the smallest integer is produced by making the necessary swaps, the function simply alternates between the first elements of the even and odd digit deques, which may not lead to the optimal result. Therefore, the program is still incorrect based on the problem description and the provided output hints.
