Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to swap adjacent digits of different parity to minimize the integer. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the relative order of even and odd digits properly. Instead of swapping adjacent digits to achieve the smallest possible integer, it simply interleaves the even and odd digits without considering their relative positions. This results in incorrect outputs for many cases, as evidenced by the problem description and the expected behavior provided in the output hints. For example, the input "246432" should produce "234642", but the current implementation does not achieve this. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
