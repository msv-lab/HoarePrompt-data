You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a huge integer a consisting of n digits (n is between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5, inclusive). It may contain leading zeros.

You can swap two digits on adjacent (neighboring) positions if the swapping digits are of different parity (that is, they have different remainders when divided by 2). 

For example, if a = 032867235 you can get the following integers in a single operation: 

  * 302867235 if you swap the first and the second digits; 
  * 023867235 if you swap the second and the third digits; 
  * 032876235 if you swap the fifth and the sixth digits; 
  * 032862735 if you swap the sixth and the seventh digits; 
  * 032867325 if you swap the seventh and the eighth digits. 



Note, that you can't swap digits on positions 2 and 4 because the positions are not adjacent. Also, you can't swap digits on positions 3 and 4 because the digits have the same parity.

You can perform any number (possibly, zero) of such operations.

Find the minimum integer you can obtain.

Note that the resulting integer also may contain leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the input.

The only line of each test case contains the integer a, its length n is between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5, inclusive.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all values n does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print line — the minimum integer you can obtain.

Example

Input


3
0709
1337
246432


Output


0079
1337
234642

Note

In the first test case, you can perform the following sequence of operations (the pair of swapped digits is highlighted): 0 \underline{70} 9 → 0079.

In the second test case, the initial integer is optimal. 

In the third test case you can perform the following sequence of operations: 246 \underline{43} 2 → 24 \underline{63}42 → 2 \underline{43} 642 → 234642.

Function number 1 :

 Output hints for function1:  This function accepts a variable number of arguments (`args`), an optional keyword argument `sep` for specifying the separator between arguments, an optional keyword argument `file` for specifying the output file (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), an optional keyword argument `end` for specifying the string appended after the last argument (defaulting to a newline), and an optional keyword argument `flush` for flushing the stream after writing. The function writes the elements of `args`, separated by `sep`, to `file`, followed by `end`. If `flush` is set to `True`, the stream is flushed after writing. After executing the function, `file` contains the concatenated strings from `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `args` is empty, no output is produced. Edge cases include handling when `args` is empty, and ensuring that `kwargs` does not contain unnecessary keys after processing.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(num):
    num = [ord(x) - ord('0') for x in num]
    (even_digits, odd_digits) = (collections.deque(), collections.deque())

        if digit & 1 == 0:

        else:
            ret.append(odd_digits.popleft())
    return ''.join(map(str, ret))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a string `num` representing a huge integer without leading zeros (except possibly for the entire number being '0'), and two deques `even_digits` and `odd_digits` containing the even and odd digits of the integer, respectively. It processes these inputs by first converting `num` into a list of integers, then separating even and odd digits into the respective deques. Next, it constructs a new list `ret` by alternating between the first elements of `even_digits` and `odd_digits` until one of the deques is exhausted. Finally, it returns an empty string since `ret` is converted to a string and returned.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
