You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a huge integer a consisting of n digits (n is between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5, inclusive). It may contain leading zeros.

You can swap two digits on adjacent (neighboring) positions if the swapping digits are of different parity (that is, they have different remainders when divided by 2). 

For example, if a = 032867235 you can get the following integers in a single operation: 

  * 302867235 if you swap the first and the second digits; 
  * 023867235 if you swap the second and the third digits; 
  * 032876235 if you swap the fifth and the sixth digits; 
  * 032862735 if you swap the sixth and the seventh digits; 
  * 032867325 if you swap the seventh and the eighth digits. 



Note, that you can't swap digits on positions 2 and 4 because the positions are not adjacent. Also, you can't swap digits on positions 3 and 4 because the digits have the same parity.

You can perform any number (possibly, zero) of such operations.

Find the minimum integer you can obtain.

Note that the resulting integer also may contain leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the input.

The only line of each test case contains the integer a, its length n is between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5, inclusive.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all values n does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print line — the minimum integer you can obtain.

Example

Input


3
0709
1337
246432


Output


0079
1337
234642

Note

In the first test case, you can perform the following sequence of operations (the pair of swapped digits is highlighted): 0 \underline{70} 9 → 0079.

In the second test case, the initial integer is optimal. 

In the third test case you can perform the following sequence of operations: 246 \underline{43} 2 → 24 \underline{63}42 → 2 \underline{43} 642 → 234642.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_2` does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the function does not ensure that adjacent swaps of different parity digits are performed optimally to achieve the minimum possible integer. Here’s an example that demonstrates the issue:

Consider the input `210`. According to the problem description, we can swap the digits at positions 1 and 2 (since they are of different parity), resulting in `102`, which is the smallest possible integer we can achieve. However, the current implementation might not perform this swap, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate, let's walk through the steps with `210`:
- Original: `210`
- Swap 1st and 2nd digits: `102`

The function should produce `102` as the output, but the current implementation might not do so due to its logic.

Here’s how the function processes `210`:
- Convert each character to an integer: `[2, 1, 0]`
- Separate even and odd digits:
  - Even: `[2]`
  - Odd: `[1]`
- Attempt to construct the result:
  - For the first position, since there is an even digit, it will take the even digit: `[2]`
  - For the second position, since there is no even digit left, it takes the odd digit: `[1]`
  - For the third position, since there is no odd digit left, it takes the remaining even digit: `[0]`

Thus, the result would be `210` instead of `102`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the output for the input `210` should be `102`, but the provided function does not guarantee this behavior. Hence, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `False`, the postcondition remains the same.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a variable number of arguments (`args`), an optional keyword argument `sep` for specifying the separator between arguments, an optional keyword argument `file` for specifying the output file (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), an optional keyword argument `end` for specifying the string appended after the last argument (defaulting to a newline), and an optional keyword argument `flush` for flushing the stream after writing. The function writes the elements of `args`, separated by `sep`, to `file`, followed by `end`. If `flush` is set to `True`, the stream is flushed after writing. After executing the function, `file` contains the concatenated strings from `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `args` is empty, no output is produced. Edge cases include handling when `args` is empty, and ensuring that `kwargs` does not contain unnecessary keys after processing.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a string representing a huge integer (consisting of n digits where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) without leading zeros except possibly for the case where the entire number is '0'. even_digits and odd_digits are dequeues containing even and odd digits of the integer respectively.

    return ''.join(map(str, ret))
    #The program returns an empty string since `ret` is an empty list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `num` representing a huge integer without leading zeros (except possibly for the entire number being '0'), and two deques `even_digits` and `odd_digits` containing the even and odd digits of the integer, respectively. It processes these inputs by first converting `num` into a list of integers, then separating even and odd digits into the respective deques. Next, it constructs a new list `ret` by alternating between the first elements of `even_digits` and `odd_digits` until one of the deques is exhausted. Finally, it returns an empty string since `ret` is converted to a string and returned.
