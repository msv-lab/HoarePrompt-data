Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_2` does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the function does not ensure that adjacent swaps of different parity digits are performed optimally to achieve the minimum possible integer.

To elaborate, the function `func_2` works by first separating the digits into even and odd deques. Then, it alternates between taking the smallest available even and odd digits, which does not necessarily lead to the optimal solution. For instance, consider the input `210`:

- Original: `210`
- Function's approach: Separates even digits `[2]` and odd digits `[1]`. It then constructs the result by alternating between even and odd digits: `[2, 1, 0]`, resulting in `210`.

However, the optimal approach would be to swap the 1st and 2nd digits to get `102`, which is smaller. The function fails to account for such optimal swaps, leading to incorrect results.

Given the examples provided in the annotated code, the function does not produce the expected results for inputs like `'210'`, `'246432'`, and others, further confirming the original assessment. Therefore, the program is not correct.
