Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_2` fails to handle the relative order of even and odd digits effectively. It simply interleaves the even and odd digits without considering the optimal order to achieve the smallest possible integer. For example, for the input "246432", the function should produce "234642" but instead, it may produce a different result due to the incorrect implementation. The annotations show that the function constructs `ret` by alternately appending the first elements of `even_digits` and `odd_digits`, which does not guarantee the minimum possible integer is achieved. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
