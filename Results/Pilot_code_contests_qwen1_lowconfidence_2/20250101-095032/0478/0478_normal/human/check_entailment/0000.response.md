Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to swap adjacent digits of different parity to minimize the integer. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where multiple even and odd digits are present, and it does not ensure that the minimum possible integer is achieved.

Consider the input "246432":
- The program sorts the digits such that even digits come before odd digits, but it does not consider the relative order of even and odd digits to achieve the smallest possible integer.
- The correct approach would involve swapping adjacent digits to move smaller even and odd digits to the front while maintaining their relative order within even and odd groups.

For example, for the input "246432", the correct minimum integer should be "234642", but the provided function does not achieve this. The function simply interleaves the even and odd digits without considering the relative order, which might not always yield the minimum possible integer.
