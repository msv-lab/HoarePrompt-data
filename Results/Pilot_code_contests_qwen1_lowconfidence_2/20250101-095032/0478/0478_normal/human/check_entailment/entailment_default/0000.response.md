Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the minimum integer by swapping adjacent digits of different parity (odd and even) any number of times. However, the code implemented in `func_2` does not actually perform any swaps; instead, it simply reorders the digits such that even digits come before odd digits. This does not necessarily result in the minimum possible integer, as the relative order of even and odd digits within the number is not preserved in a way that minimizes the final value.

For example, consider the input "246432". The correct solution should involve swapping '4' and '3' to get "236442", but the provided code would incorrectly return "234642". This shows that the code does not correctly implement the required logic to achieve the minimum possible integer through valid swaps.
