`ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` modulo 2 is not 0, and either the element at index `(n + 1) // 2` in list `r` is truthy or the element at index `(n + 1) // 2` in list `c` is truthy. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `r` is a list of integers; `c` is a list of integers; `ans` is equal to the original value of `ans` plus 1; the value of `n` modulo 2 is not 0; either the element at index `(n + 1) // 2` in list `r` is truthy or the element at index `(n + 1) // 2` in list `c` is truthy.**
