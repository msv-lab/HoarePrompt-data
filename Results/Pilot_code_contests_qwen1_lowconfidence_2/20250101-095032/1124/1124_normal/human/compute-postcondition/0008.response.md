`r[x]` is set to `0` and `c[y]` is set to `0`. The values of `n`, `m`, `ban`, `r`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` must be greater than 1, `ban` is a list of `m-2` tuples, `r` and `c` lists are unchanged except `r[x]` and `c[y]` are both 0, and `ans` is 0**
