The code provided is a lambda function that reads multiple integers from standard input and splits them into a list. This function does not assign any values directly to variables `n` or `m`, nor does it modify the list of banned cells. It simply defines a new function that can be called later to read input.

Therefore, the only thing that changes is the definition of the function `rints`, which now exists. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and the list of banned cells remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and there are m pairs of integers (xi, yi) such that 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, representing the coordinates of banned cells. A function `rints` is defined which reads multiple integers from standard input and splits them into a list.**
