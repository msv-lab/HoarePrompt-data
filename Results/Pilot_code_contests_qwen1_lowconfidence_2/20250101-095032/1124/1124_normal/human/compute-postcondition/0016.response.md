Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000.
- `m` is 0.
- `ban` is an empty list.
- `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s.
- `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s.
- `ans` is 0.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(2, 2 + (n - 2) // 2):
    ans += sum([r[i], r[n - i + 1], c[i], c[n - i + 1]])
```

### Observations from the Provided Output States
1. **Output State after the loop executes 1 time**:
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `ban` is an empty list.
   - `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s.
   - `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s.
   - `ans` is `sum([1, 1, 1, 1]) = 4`.

2. **Output State after the loop executes 2 times**:
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `m` is 1.
   - `ban` is an empty list.
   - `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s.
   - `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s.
   - `ans` is 12.
   
3. **Output State after the loop executes 3 times**:
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `m` is 1.
   - `ban` is an empty list.
   - `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s.
   - `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s.
   - `ans` is 16.
   - `i` is 3.

### Analysis
- The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `2 + (n - 2) // 2`.
- For each iteration, `ans` is incremented by the sum of four elements: `r[i]`, `r[n - i + 1]`, `c[i]`, and `c[n - i + 1]`. Since `r` and `c` are initially filled with 1s, this sum is always 4.

### Final State Calculation
- The loop will run exactly `(n - 2) // 2` times because `i` starts from 2 and increments by 1 until `2 + (n - 2) // 2`.
- Therefore, the loop will add 4 to `ans` for each iteration.
- The number of iterations is `n - 2` if `n` is even, or `n - 3` if `n` is odd. This can be expressed as `k = (n - 2) // 2`.

Thus, the final value of `ans` will be:
\[ \text{ans} = 4 \times k = 4 \times \frac{n - 2}{2} = 2(n - 2) \]

### Final Output State
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000.
- `m` is 0.
- `ban` is an empty list.
- `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s.
- `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s.
- `ans` is `2(n - 2)`.

### Output State:
**Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is 0, `ban` is an empty list, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s, `ans` is `2(n - 2)`.**
