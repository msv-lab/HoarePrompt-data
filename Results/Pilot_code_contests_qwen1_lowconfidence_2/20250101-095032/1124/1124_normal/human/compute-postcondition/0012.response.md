Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is at least 2
- `m` is 0
- `ban` is an empty list
- `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s
- `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s
- `ans` is `sum([1, 1, 1, 1])` which evaluates to 4

### Loop Details:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(2, 2 + (n - 2) // 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 2 up to `2 + (n - 2) // 2`.
2. **Range Calculation**:
   - For `n = 2`, `(n - 2) // 2` is 0, so the range is from 2 to 2, meaning the loop runs once.
   - For `n > 2`, the loop runs for values of `i` starting from 2 up to `2 + (n - 2) // 2`.

3. **Current Value of `i`**: Since we are determining the state at the start of the next iteration, `i` must have reached its maximum value in the previous iteration. 

4. **Determine Maximum `i`**:
   - Let's assume `i` has just completed its last iteration. This means `i` is now `2 + (n - 2) // 2 - 1`.
   - Simplifying, `i` is now `1 + (n - 2) // 2`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `n` remains unchanged since the loop condition does not depend on `n` itself.
   - `m` will increase by 1 because the loop variable `i` starts from 2 and increments by 1 each time.
   - `ban` remains an empty list unless the loop body modifies it, but no modification is mentioned.
   - `r` and `c` remain lists of length `n + 1` filled with 1s unless the loop body modifies them, but no modification is mentioned.
   - `ans` remains 4 unless the loop body modifies it, but no modification is mentioned.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, the state should reflect the updated value of `m` and the potential updated values of `r` and `c` if the loop body modified them. However, based on the information given, no modifications to these lists or `ans` are indicated.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is 1, `ban` is an empty list, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s, `ans` is 4**
