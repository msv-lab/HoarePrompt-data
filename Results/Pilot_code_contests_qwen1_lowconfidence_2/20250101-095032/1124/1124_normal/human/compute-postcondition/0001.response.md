`n, m` are assigned the values obtained from calling the function `rints()`. This function reads multiple integers from standard input and splits them into a list. Since the exact input values are not specified, the values of `n` and `m` will be whatever integers are inputted, but they are constrained by the initial state conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 0 and 10^5, and they are the values read from standard input by the function `rints()`.**
