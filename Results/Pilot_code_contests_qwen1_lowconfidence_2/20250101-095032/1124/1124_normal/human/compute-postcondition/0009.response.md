Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is 0, `ban` is an empty list, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the list `ban`. For each iteration, the values `r[x]` and `c[y]` are set to 0.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as there are tuples in the list `ban`. Once all tuples have been processed, the loop will stop.
- After all iterations of the loop, if no tuples were present in `ban`, the lists `r` and `c` will remain as they were initialized (all elements are 1), and `ban` will be an empty list.
- If `ban` was initially a list with multiple tuples, after all iterations, `ban` will be an empty list, and the lists `r` and `c` will have their corresponding indices set to 0 for each `(x, y)` pair that was processed.
