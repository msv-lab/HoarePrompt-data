The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the problem statement, there are implicit constraints and relationships involving `n` and `m` as well as `xi` and `yi` which represent the coordinates of banned cells. The function processes these implicit inputs and returns a value.

Functionality: **The function accepts implicit inputs where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and there are m pairs of integers (xi, yi) such that 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, representing the coordinates of banned cells. The function returns a value based on these inputs.**
