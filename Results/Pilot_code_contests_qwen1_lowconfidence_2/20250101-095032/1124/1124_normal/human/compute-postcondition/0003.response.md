Let's break down the requirements for the loop to execute:

1. The loop iterates over pairs `(x, y)` from the list `ban`.
2. For the loop to start, `ban` must contain at least one tuple.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000.
- `m` is an integer between 0 and \(10^5\).
- `ban` is a list of `m` tuples, each containing four integers.
- `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s.
- `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s.
- `ans` is 0.

The key point here is ensuring that `ban` contains at least one tuple, as the loop will only execute if there is at least one element in `ban`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `m` is greater than 0. This ensures that `ban` is not empty and the loop can proceed.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` must be greater than 0, `ban` is a list of `m` tuples, each containing four integers, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s, and `ans` is 0.**
