Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `r` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of integers, and `ans` is equal to the original value of `ans` plus 1. If `n` modulo 2 is not 0 and either the element at index `(n + 1) // 2` in list `r` is truthy or the element at index `(n + 1) // 2` in list `c` is truthy, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied and the values of `n`, `r`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
