The code `print(ans)` prints the value of `ans`. Since no assignment or modification is performed on `ans` within this line of code, the value of `ans` remains unchanged from its previous state. The other variables (`n`, `r`, `c`) also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `r` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is equal to the original value of `ans` plus 1.**
