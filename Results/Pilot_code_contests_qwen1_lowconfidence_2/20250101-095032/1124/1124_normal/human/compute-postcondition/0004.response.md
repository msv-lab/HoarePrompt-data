The code updates the values of `r[x]` and `c[y]` to 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `ban`, `r`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` must be greater than 0, `ban` is a list of `m` tuples, each containing four integers, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s except `r[x]` which is 0, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s except `c[y]` which is 0, and `ans` is 0.**
