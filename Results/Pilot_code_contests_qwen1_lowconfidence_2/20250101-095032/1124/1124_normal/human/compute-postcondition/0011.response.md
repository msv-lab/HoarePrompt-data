Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is 0, `ban` is an empty list, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s, `ans` is `sum([1, 1, 1, 1])`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the sum of `[r[i], r[n - i + 1], c[i], c[n - i + 1]]`. Given that both `r` and `c` are lists of length `n + 1` filled with 1s, each of these four elements is 1. Therefore, the sum is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1`, which is 4. Since `ans` was initially 0, after executing this line, `ans` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
