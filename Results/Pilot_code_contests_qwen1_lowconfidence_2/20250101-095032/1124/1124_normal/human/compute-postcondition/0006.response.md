The code `r[x], c[y] = 0, 0` assigns the value `0` to both `r[x]` and `c[y]`. The variables `n`, `m`, `ban`, `r`, `c`, and `ans` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` must be greater than 1, `ban` is a list of `m-1` tuples, `r` and `c` lists are unchanged except `r[x]` and `c[y]` are both 0, and `ans` is 0.**
