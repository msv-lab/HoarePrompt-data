According to the code, the loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the list `ban`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one tuple remaining in the list `ban`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `ban` is a list of `m-1` tuples.
- `r` and `c` lists are unchanged except `r[x]` and `c[y]` are both 0.
- `ans` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more tuple in the list `ban`. This means that the list `ban` should have `m-2` tuples after this iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` must be greater than 1, `ban` is a list of `m-2` tuples, `r` and `c` lists are unchanged except `r[x]` and `c[y]` are both 0, and `ans` is 0**.
