Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to handle the case where chips are placed on border cells (not corner cells) and moved according to the rules. The code incorrectly marks rows and columns as invalid when banned cells are encountered, which leads to an incorrect count of valid placements.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 0
```

The expected output should be 2 because we can place chips on any of the border cells (excluding corners) and move them without violating the game rules. However, the current implementation will only allow placing one chip, as it incorrectly counts the number of valid cells.

To fix this, the code needs to correctly identify and count valid border cells (excluding corners) and ensure that chips can be placed and moved according to the specified rules without overlapping or landing on banned cells.
