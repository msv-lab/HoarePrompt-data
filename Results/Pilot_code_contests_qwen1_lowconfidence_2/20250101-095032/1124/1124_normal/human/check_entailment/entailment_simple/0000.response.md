Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The initialization of `r` and `c` lists to `[1] * (n + 1)` is incorrect. These should represent the borders (rows and columns) of the board, and should be initialized to 1s for non-banned cells.
   - The loop that sets `r[x]` and `c[y]` to 0 for banned cells is also flawed. It should set the corresponding entries in `r` and `c` to 0, but instead it incorrectly resets them to 0 without considering the initial state.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Cells:**
   - The loop `for i in range(2, 2 + (n - 2) // 2):` attempts to count valid cells on the borders, but it does not correctly handle the symmetry of the board. It only checks specific positions and does not ensure that all valid cells are counted.
   - The condition `if (n % 2 and (r[(n + 1) // 2] or c[(n + 1) // 2])):` is unnecessary and incorrect. It checks the middle row and column, which is not part of the border and is not relevant to the problem.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the board size `n` is even. For even `n`, the middle cells `(n//2, n//2)` are not considered in the current logic.
   - The program does not correctly account for the symmetry of the board and the requirement that chips move to the opposite border without colliding or falling on banned cells.

To correctly implement the solution, the program needs to:
- Initialize `r` and `c` properly based on the banned cells.
- Correctly count the valid border cells while ensuring no two chips collide or fall on banned cells.
- Handle both even and odd-sized boards correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ban = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Initialize border arrays
    r = [1] * (n + 1)
    c = [1] * (n + 1)
    
    # Mark banned cells
    for x, y in ban:
        r[x] = 0
        c[y] = 0
    
    # Count valid cells
    ans = 0
    for i in range(2, n):
        if r[i] and r[n - i + 1]:
            ans += 1
        if c[i] and c[n - i + 1]:
            ans += 1
    
    # Handle center cell for odd n
    if n % 2 == 1:
        if r[(n + 1) // 2] and c[(n + 1) // 2]:
            ans += 1
    
    print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version initializes the border arrays correctly, handles the symmetry of the board, and ensures that no two chips collide or fall on banned cells.
