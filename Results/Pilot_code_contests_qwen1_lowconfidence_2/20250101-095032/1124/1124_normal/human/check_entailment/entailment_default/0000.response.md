Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code aims to count the number of valid squares (of different sizes) within an \(n \times n\) grid, excluding the banned cells. However, the problem requires placing chips on the border cells and moving them to the opposite border cells without violating the given constraints.

The function `func` incorrectly counts the number of valid squares instead of determining the maximum number of chips that can be placed on the border cells without falling into banned cells or overlapping with other chips. Additionally, the function does not account for the movement of chips over time, which is a crucial part of the problem.

For example, consider the following case:
- Input:
  ```
  4 3
  3 1
  3 2
  3 3
  ```

  According to the problem description, the only valid positions for chips are on the border cells, and no two chips can be on the same cell at any time. The given code would incorrectly count the number of valid squares, which does not reflect the actual constraints of the problem.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and hence is incorrect.
