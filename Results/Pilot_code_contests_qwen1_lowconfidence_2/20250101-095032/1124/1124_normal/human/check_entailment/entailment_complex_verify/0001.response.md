Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly handle the placement of multiple chips on the same border cell without violating the game rules. The annotated version confirms that the code incorrectly counts the number of valid border cells without ensuring that multiple chips can be placed on the same cell. The logic for counting valid cells and the conditions for adding to `ans` do not account for the possibility of placing multiple chips on the same cell, which is allowed according to the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
