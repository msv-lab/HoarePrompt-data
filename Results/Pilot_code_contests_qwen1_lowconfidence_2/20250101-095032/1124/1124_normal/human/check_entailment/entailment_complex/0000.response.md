Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the number of valid squares (or chips that can be placed) on a grid, but it does not correctly account for the movement constraints and the loss conditions specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Positions:**
   - The program calculates the number of valid positions for placing chips by considering only certain rows and columns, but it does not properly account for the movement constraint that each chip must move from one border to the opposite border without colliding with another chip or a banned cell.
   - The logic inside the `for` loop that sums up the valid positions does not reflect the actual movement rules of the game. It assumes that any position that is not banned can be used to place a chip, which is not necessarily true due to the movement constraints.

2. **Movement Constraints Not Properly Enforced:**
   - The problem description states that each chip must move from one border to the opposite border in \(n-1\) minutes, and no two chips should occupy the same cell at any time during this process. The program does not enforce these constraints, nor does it simulate the chip movements to ensure they follow the rules.
   - For example, the program does not check whether placing a chip in a certain position would result in two chips swapping places in the middle of the grid, which is explicitly forbidden.

3. **Loss Conditions Not Considered:**
   - The program does not check for the loss conditions mentioned in the problem description. Specifically, it does not ensure that:
     - At least one of the chips does not fall into a banned cell at any point.
     - No two chips ever occupy the same cell at any point.
     - No two chips swap places during the movement.

4. **Central Cell Check for Odd \(n\):**
   - The check for the central cell (when \(n\) is odd) is too simplistic. It only checks if the central cell is not banned, but it does not consider the movement constraints and whether placing a chip there would violate the other loss conditions.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
