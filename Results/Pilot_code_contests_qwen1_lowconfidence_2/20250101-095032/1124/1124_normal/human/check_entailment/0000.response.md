Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition where two chips might swap positions during the game. Specifically, the program does not check if two chips could move to the same cell, which would result in a loss according to the problem description.

For example, consider a 4x4 board with no banned cells:
- Place a chip on cell (1, 2).
- Place another chip on cell (4, 3).

During the game, both chips will move towards the center of their respective rows:
- The chip at (1, 2) will move to (2, 2).
- The chip at (4, 3) will also move to (3, 3).

This results in the chips being on the same cell at the midpoint, which is a losing condition. However, the provided program does not account for this scenario and thus may incorrectly calculate the maximum points.
