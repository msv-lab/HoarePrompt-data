The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and an integer `m` (0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) representing the number of banned cells, along with `m` pairs of integers (xi, yi) (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n) indicating the coordinates of the banned cells. The function processes the banned cells by marking them in two lists `r` and `c` which represent rows and columns respectively. It then calculates the number of valid squares of different sizes that can be formed within the grid of size `n x n`, excluding the banned cells. Finally, it checks for a central cell if `n` is odd and adds one to the count if the central cell is not banned. The function returns the total count of valid squares.
