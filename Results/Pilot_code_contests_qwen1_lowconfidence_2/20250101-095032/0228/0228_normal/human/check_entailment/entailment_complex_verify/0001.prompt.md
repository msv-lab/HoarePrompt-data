You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The princess is going to escape the dragon's cave, and she needs to plan it carefully.

The princess runs at vp miles per hour, and the dragon flies at vd miles per hour. The dragon will discover the escape after t hours and will chase the princess immediately. Looks like there's no chance to success, but the princess noticed that the dragon is very greedy and not too smart. To delay him, the princess decides to borrow a couple of bijous from his treasury. Once the dragon overtakes the princess, she will drop one bijou to distract him. In this case he will stop, pick up the item, return to the cave and spend f hours to straighten the things out in the treasury. Only after this will he resume the chase again from the very beginning.

The princess is going to run on the straight. The distance between the cave and the king's castle she's aiming for is c miles. How many bijous will she need to take from the treasury to be able to reach the castle? If the dragon overtakes the princess at exactly the same moment she has reached the castle, we assume that she reached the castle before the dragon reached her, and doesn't need an extra bijou to hold him off.

Input

The input data contains integers vp, vd, t, f and c, one per line (1 ≤ vp, vd ≤ 100, 1 ≤ t, f ≤ 10, 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000).

Output

Output the minimal number of bijous required for the escape to succeed.

Note

In the first case one hour after the escape the dragon will discover it, and the princess will be 1 mile away from the cave. In two hours the dragon will overtake the princess 2 miles away from the cave, and she will need to drop the first bijou. Return to the cave and fixing the treasury will take the dragon two more hours; meanwhile the princess will be 4 miles away from the cave. Next time the dragon will overtake the princess 8 miles away from the cave, and she will need the second bijou, but after this she will reach the castle without any further trouble.

The second case is similar to the first one, but the second time the dragon overtakes the princess when she has reached the castle, and she won't need the second bijou.
Program:
```
def func():
    vp = int(raw_input())
    vd = int(raw_input())
    t_read = int(raw_input())
    f = int(raw_input())
    c = int(raw_input())
    pl = 0
    dl = 0
    t = 1
    count = 0
    while pl + vp <= c:
        pl += vp
        if t > t_read:
            dl += vd
            if dl >= pl and pl + vp <= c:
                count += 1
                dl = pl
                pl += (2 * (dl / vd) + f) * vp
        t += 1
    print(count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the position of the dragon (`dl`) and the princess (`pl`). Specifically, the condition `if dl >= pl` does not accurately represent the scenario where the dragon overtakes the princess. The dragon overtakes the princess when the distance the dragon has traveled (`dl`) equals the distance the princess has traveled (`pl`), not when `dl` is greater than or equal to `pl`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:
- vp = 1
- vd = 2
- t = 1
- f = 1
- c = 10

According to the problem description, the dragon will overtake the princess at the same time she reaches the castle, so she should not need any bijous. However, the current implementation might incorrectly calculate that she needs bijous because it checks if `dl >= pl`, which is not the correct condition.

A corrected version of the condition would be `if dl == pl`. This ensures that the dragon overtakes the princess only when they are at the same position.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: vp, vd, t, f, and c are integers where 1 ≤ vp, vd ≤ 100, 1 ≤ t, f ≤ 10, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000. vp represents the speed of the princess, vd represents the speed of the dragon, t is the time after which the dragon discovers the escape, f is the time the dragon spends fixing the treasury, and c is the distance from the cave to the king's castle.
def func():
    vp = int(raw_input())
    vd = int(raw_input())
    t_read = int(raw_input())
    f = int(raw_input())
    c = int(raw_input())
    pl = 0
    dl = 0
    t = 1
    count = 0
    while pl + vp <= c:
        pl += vp
        
        if t > t_read:
            dl += vd
            if dl >= pl and pl + vp <= c:
                count += 1
                dl = pl
                pl += (2 * (dl / vd) + f) * vp
        
        t += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `pl` is the final value of `pl` after all iterations; `dl` is the final value of `dl` after all iterations; `t` is the final value of `t` after all iterations; `count` is the final value of `count` after all iterations.
    print(count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts five integer parameters `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c`, representing the speed of the princess, the speed of the dragon, the time after which the dragon discovers the escape, the time the dragon spends fixing the treasury, and the distance from the cave to the king's castle, respectively. The function calculates whether the princess can escape to the castle without being caught by the dragon. If the princess can escape, the function prints the number of times the dragon catches up to her before she escapes. If she cannot escape, the function prints 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
