You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The princess is going to escape the dragon's cave, and she needs to plan it carefully.

The princess runs at vp miles per hour, and the dragon flies at vd miles per hour. The dragon will discover the escape after t hours and will chase the princess immediately. Looks like there's no chance to success, but the princess noticed that the dragon is very greedy and not too smart. To delay him, the princess decides to borrow a couple of bijous from his treasury. Once the dragon overtakes the princess, she will drop one bijou to distract him. In this case he will stop, pick up the item, return to the cave and spend f hours to straighten the things out in the treasury. Only after this will he resume the chase again from the very beginning.

The princess is going to run on the straight. The distance between the cave and the king's castle she's aiming for is c miles. How many bijous will she need to take from the treasury to be able to reach the castle? If the dragon overtakes the princess at exactly the same moment she has reached the castle, we assume that she reached the castle before the dragon reached her, and doesn't need an extra bijou to hold him off.

Input

The input data contains integers vp, vd, t, f and c, one per line (1 ≤ vp, vd ≤ 100, 1 ≤ t, f ≤ 10, 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000).

Output

Output the minimal number of bijous required for the escape to succeed.

Note

In the first case one hour after the escape the dragon will discover it, and the princess will be 1 mile away from the cave. In two hours the dragon will overtake the princess 2 miles away from the cave, and she will need to drop the first bijou. Return to the cave and fixing the treasury will take the dragon two more hours; meanwhile the princess will be 4 miles away from the cave. Next time the dragon will overtake the princess 8 miles away from the cave, and she will need the second bijou, but after this she will reach the castle without any further trouble.

The second case is similar to the first one, but the second time the dragon overtakes the princess when she has reached the castle, and she won't need the second bijou.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: vp, vd, t, f, and c are integers where 1 ≤ vp, vd ≤ 100, 1 ≤ t, f ≤ 10, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000. vp represents the speed of the princess, vd represents the speed of the dragon, t is the time after which the dragon discovers the escape, f is the time the dragon spends fixing the treasury, and c is the distance from the cave to the king's castle.
def func():
    vp = int(raw_input())
    vd = int(raw_input())
    t_read = int(raw_input())
    f = int(raw_input())
    c = int(raw_input())
    pl = 0
    dl = 0
    t = 1
    count = 0
    while pl + vp <= c:
        pl += vp
        
        if t > t_read:
            dl += vd
            if dl >= pl and pl + vp <= c:
                count += 1
                dl = pl
                pl += (2 * (dl / vd) + f) * vp
        
        t += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `pl` is the final value of `pl` after all iterations; `dl` is the final value of `dl` after all iterations; `t` is the final value of `t` after all iterations; `count` is the final value of `count` after all iterations.
    print(count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts five integer parameters `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c`, representing the speed of the princess, the speed of the dragon, the time after which the dragon discovers the escape, the time the dragon spends fixing the treasury, and the distance from the cave to the king's castle, respectively. The function calculates whether the princess can escape to the castle without being caught by the dragon. If the princess can escape, the function prints the number of times the dragon catches up to her before she escapes. If she cannot escape, the function prints 0.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
