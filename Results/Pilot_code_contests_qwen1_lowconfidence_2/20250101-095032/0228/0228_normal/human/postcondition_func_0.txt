The function accepts five integer parameters `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c`, representing the speed of the princess, the speed of the dragon, the time after which the dragon discovers the escape, the time the dragon spends fixing the treasury, and the distance from the cave to the king's castle, respectively. The function calculates whether the princess can escape to the castle without being caught by the dragon. If the princess can escape, the function prints the number of times the dragon catches up to her before she escapes. If she cannot escape, the function prints 0.
