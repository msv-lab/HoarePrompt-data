Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `pl + vp <= c`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `vp` is the integer value entered by the user.
   - `vd` is the integer value entered by the user (not relevant to the loop).
   - `t` is 1.
   - `f` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `c` is the integer value entered by the user.
   - `t_read` is the integer value entered by the user.
   - `pl` is 0.
   - `dl` is 0.
   - `count` is 0.

3. **Determine the Required State for the First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `pl + vp <= c` must be true.
   - Currently, `pl` is 0, so the condition simplifies to `0 + vp <= c`, which means `vp <= c`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to ensure that `vp` is less than or equal to `c`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - The state right before the loop needs to include the condition that `vp` is less than or equal to `c`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`vp` is the integer value entered by the user and `vp` must be less than or equal to `c`**
