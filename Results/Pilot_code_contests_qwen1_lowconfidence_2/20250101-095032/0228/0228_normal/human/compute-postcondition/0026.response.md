Postcondition: ***`vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`. If `dl >= pl` and `pl + vp <= c`, then `pl` is updated to `pl + (2 * (pl / vd) + f) * vp`; `dl` remains equal to `pl`; `t` remains unchanged; `count` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if-else block executes.***
