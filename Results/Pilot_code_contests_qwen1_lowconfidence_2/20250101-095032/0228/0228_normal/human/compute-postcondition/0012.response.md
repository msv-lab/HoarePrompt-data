`dl` is incremented by `vd`. The previous value of `dl` is not specified, so it remains unknown, but it is increased by `vd`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`. `pl` is the previous value of `pl` plus `vp`. `t` is greater than `t_read`; `dl` is increased by `vd`.**
