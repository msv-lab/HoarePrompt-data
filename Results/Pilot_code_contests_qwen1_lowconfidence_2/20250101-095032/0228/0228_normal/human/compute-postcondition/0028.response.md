The value of `t` is incremented by 1. The conditions in the if-else block are not evaluated because the code executed is `t += 1`, which does not depend on the values of other variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `t` is incremented by 1; `dl` remains equal to `pl`; `t` remains unchanged; `count` remains unchanged.**
