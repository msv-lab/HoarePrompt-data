`count` is incremented by 1, but the initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `pl` is the previous value of `pl` plus `vp`; `t` is greater than `t_read`; `dl` is increased by `vd`; the current value of `dl` is greater than or equal to `pl` and the current value of `pl` plus `vp` is less than or equal to `c`; `count` is incremented by 1.
