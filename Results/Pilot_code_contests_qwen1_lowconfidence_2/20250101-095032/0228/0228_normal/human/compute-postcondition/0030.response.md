`pl` is incremented by `vp`. The value of `vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `t` is incremented by 1; `dl` remains equal to `pl`; `pl` is equal to `pl + vp`; `count` remains unchanged.**
