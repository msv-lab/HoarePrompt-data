`pl` is incremented by `vp`. Since `vp` is the integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`, the value of `pl` is updated by adding `vp` to its current value. The state of `vp` and `c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`vp` is the integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `pl` is the previous value of `pl` plus `vp`.**
