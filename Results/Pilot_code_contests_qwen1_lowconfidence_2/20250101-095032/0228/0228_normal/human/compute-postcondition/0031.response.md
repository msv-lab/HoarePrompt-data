`dl` is incremented by `vd`. The value of `vd` is not specified in the initial state, so we will keep it as `vd`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `t` is incremented by 1; `dl` is equal to `pl + vd`; `pl` is equal to `pl + vp`; `count` remains unchanged.**
