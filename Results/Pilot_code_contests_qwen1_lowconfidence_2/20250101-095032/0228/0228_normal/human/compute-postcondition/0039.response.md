The `print(count)` statement simply prints the value of the variable `count`. It does not modify any variables or change the state of any other variables in the program. Therefore, the only change is the output of the value of `count`.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `pl` is the final value of `pl` after all iterations; `dl` is the final value of `dl` after all iterations; `t` is the final value of `t` after all iterations; `count` is printed and its value remains the same as the final value after all iterations.**
