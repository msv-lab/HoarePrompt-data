`vp` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. This means that `vp` now holds the integer value entered by the user, while the values of `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vp` is the integer value entered by the user, `vd` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10, and `c` is an integer between 1 and 1000.**
