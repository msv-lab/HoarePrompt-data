`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `vp` is still an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `t` is still incremented by 1; `dl` is still equal to `pl + vd`; `pl` is still equal to `pl + vp`; `count` is now `count + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `t` is incremented by 1; `dl` is equal to `pl + vd`; `pl` is equal to `pl + vp`; `count` is `count + 1`.
Output State: **`vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `t` is incremented by 1; `dl` is equal to `pl + vd`; `pl` is equal to `pl + vp`; `count` is `count + 1`**
