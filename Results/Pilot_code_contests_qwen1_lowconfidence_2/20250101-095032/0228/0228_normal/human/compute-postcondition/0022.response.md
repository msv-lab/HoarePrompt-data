The code snippet `dl += vd` increments the value of `dl` by `vd`. According to the initial state, `dl` is equal to `pl`, and `pl` is updated based on certain conditions. Let's follow the steps:

1. The initial state includes: `vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `pl` is the current value of `pl + vp`; `dl` is equal to `pl`; `t` is greater than `t_read`, in which case `pl` is updated to `pl + vp + 2 * ((pl + vp) / vd) * vp + f * vp`, `dl` remains equal to `pl`, `count` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `pl + vp` is less than or equal to `c`; `t` is `t + 1`, and `pl + vp` must be less than or equal to `c` after the loop body executes.

2. The code `dl += vd` simply adds `vd` to `dl`.

3. Since `dl` is initially set to `pl`, adding `vd` to `dl` means `dl` now holds the value of `pl + vd`.

4. The other variables (`pl`, `vp`, `c`, `t`, `t_read`, `count`, and `f`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `pl` is the current value of `pl + vp`; `dl` is equal to `pl + vd`; `t` is greater than `t_read`, in which case `pl` is updated to `pl + vp + 2 * ((pl + vp) / vd) * vp + f * vp`, `dl` remains equal to `pl`, `count` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `pl + vp` is less than or equal to `c`; `t` is `t + 1`, and `pl + vp` must be less than or equal to `c` after the loop body executes.**
