`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `count` was previously `count + 1` (since it is incremented), and all other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `pl` is the current value of `pl + vp`; `dl` is equal to `pl + vd`; `t` is greater than `t_read`, in which case `pl` is updated to `pl + vp + 2 * ((pl + vp) / vd) * vp + f * vp`, `dl` remains equal to `pl`, `count` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `pl + vp` is less than or equal to `c`; `t` is `t + 1`, and `pl + vp` must be less than or equal to `c` after the loop body executes; `count` is `count + 1`.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `pl` is the current value of `pl + vp`; `dl` is equal to `pl + vd`; `t` is greater than `t_read`, in which case `pl` is updated to `pl + vp + 2 * ((pl + vp) / vd) * vp + f * vp`, `dl` remains equal to `pl`, `count` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `pl + vp` is less than or equal to `c`; `t` is `t + 1`, and `pl + vp` must be less than or equal to `c` after the loop body executes; `count` is `count + 1`**.
