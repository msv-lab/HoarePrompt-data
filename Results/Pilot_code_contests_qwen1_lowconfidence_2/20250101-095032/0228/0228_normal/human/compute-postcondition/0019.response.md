`t` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not specified. The other variables (`vp`, `pl`, `dl`, `t_read`, `vd`, `f`, `count`) remain unchanged. The conditions mentioned in the initial state still hold true.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `pl` is the previous value of `pl` plus `vp`; `dl` is equal to `pl`; `t` is greater than `t_read`, in which case `pl` is updated to `pl + vp + 2 * ((pl + vp) / vd) * vp + f * vp`, `dl` remains equal to `pl`, `count` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `pl + vp` is less than or equal to `c`; `t` is `t + 1`.**
