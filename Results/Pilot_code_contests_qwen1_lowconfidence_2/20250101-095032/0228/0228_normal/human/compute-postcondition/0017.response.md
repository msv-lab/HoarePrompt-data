Postcondition: ***`vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`. `pl` is updated to `pl + vp + 2 * ((pl + vp) / vd) * vp + f * vp`. `t` is greater than `t_read`; `dl` is equal to `pl`. The current value of `dl` is greater than or equal to `pl` and the current value of `pl + vp` is less than or equal to `c`. `count` is incremented by 1. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold true regardless of the if condition's outcome.***
