`t` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `t` and other variables are as follows: `vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `dl` is updated to `pl` if `t` is not greater than `t_read` or if `dl` is already less than `pl`. Otherwise, `dl` is updated to `pl + vp`; `pl` is updated to `pl + (2 * (pl / vd) + f) * vp`; `count` is incremented by 1. The only change is in the value of `t`.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer value entered by the user and must be less than or equal to `c`; `dl` is updated to `pl` if `t` is not greater than `t_read` or if `dl` is already less than `pl`. Otherwise, `dl` is updated to `pl + vp`; `pl` is updated to `pl + (2 * (pl / vd) + f) * vp`; `count` is incremented by 1; `t` is incremented by 1.**
