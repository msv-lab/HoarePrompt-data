Functionality: **The function accepts five integer parameters `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c`, representing the speed of the princess, the speed of the dragon, the time after which the dragon discovers the escape, the time the dragon spends fixing the treasury, and the distance from the cave to the king's castle, respectively. The function calculates whether the princess can escape to the castle without being caught by the dragon. If the princess can escape, the function prints the number of times the dragon catches up to her before she escapes. If she cannot escape, the function prints 0.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function reads input values for `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c` from the user, which means it expects valid integer inputs within the specified ranges.
- If the dragon discovers the princess (`t > t_read`), the dragon will catch up to the princess if the distance between them is less than or equal to the distance the dragon has traveled (`dl >= pl`).
- The function assumes that the princess and the dragon start at the same point (origin) and move in the same direction towards the castle.
- If the princess reaches the castle (`pl + vp > c`), the function exits the loop and determines if she has escaped.
- There is no explicit check for invalid input types or out-of-range values, which could lead to runtime errors if non-integer values are provided.
