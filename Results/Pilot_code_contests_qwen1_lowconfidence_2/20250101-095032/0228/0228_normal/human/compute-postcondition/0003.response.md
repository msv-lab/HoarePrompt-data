`f` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input from the user and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`vp`, `vd`, `t`, `c`, `t_read`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `vp` is the integer value entered by the user, `vd` is the integer value entered by the user, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `t_read` is the integer value entered by the user.

Output State: **`vp` is the integer value entered by the user, `vd` is the integer value entered by the user, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `t_read` is the integer value entered by the user**
