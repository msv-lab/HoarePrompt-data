Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program involves segment tree operations (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`), which are not aligned with the problem's requirements. The problem requires calculating how many dominoes will fall if a given domino is pushed to the right, but the functions do not appear to handle this calculation.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
16 5
20 5
10 10
18 2
```

The expected output is:
```
3 1 4 1 
```

However, the provided code does not contain any function that processes the dominoes according to the problem statement. Instead, it seems to be dealing with segment tree operations, which are not relevant to the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and is incorrect.
