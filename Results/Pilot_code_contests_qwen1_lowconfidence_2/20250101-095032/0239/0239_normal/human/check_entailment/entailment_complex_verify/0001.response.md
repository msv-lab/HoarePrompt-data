Final: **True**

### Reasoning:

Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program appears to be correct. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Segment Tree Initialization and Updates**:
   - The segment tree is initialized with a size of `4 * n` to handle the range of domino indices.
   - The `func_2` function correctly updates the segment tree to store the maximum number of dominoes that can fall if a domino at a given index is pushed. This ensures that the segment tree reflects the maximum number of falling dominoes for any sub-range.

2. **Binary Search and Querying the Segment Tree**:
   - The `func_4` function uses binary search to find the farthest domino that would be affected if the `i`-th domino is pushed. This is achieved by comparing the position of the mid-point domino with the position of the `i`-th domino plus its height.
   - Once the range `[i, e]` is determined, `func_3` is called to query the segment tree for the total number of dominoes that will fall within this range.

3. **Resolving the Number of Falling Dominoes**:
   - For each domino `i`, the function `func_4` determines the range of dominoes that will fall if `i` is pushed.
   - The result is stored in `res` and the segment tree is updated accordingly.
   - Finally, the results are sorted and the differences between the start and end indices of the falling dominoes are calculated and printed.

Given the annotated version, the program follows a systematic approach to solve the problem. The segment tree is correctly used to efficiently update and query the number of falling dominoes. The binary search in `func_4` accurately identifies the range of dominoes affected, and `func_3` queries the segment tree to get the correct count.

Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **False** seems inaccurate based on the provided annotations and the logic of the code. The program does meet the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
