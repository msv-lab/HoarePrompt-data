You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya is interested in arranging dominoes. He is fed up with common dominoes and he uses the dominoes of different heights. He put n dominoes on the table along one axis, going from left to right. Every domino stands perpendicular to that axis so that the axis passes through the center of its base. The i-th domino has the coordinate xi and the height hi. Now Vasya wants to learn for every domino, how many dominoes will fall if he pushes it to the right. Help him do that. 

Consider that a domino falls if it is touched strictly above the base. In other words, the fall of the domino with the initial coordinate x and height h leads to the fall of all dominoes on the segment [x + 1, x + h - 1].

<image>

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which is the number of dominoes. Then follow n lines containing two integers xi and hi ( - 108 ≤ xi ≤ 108, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 108) each, which are the coordinate and height of every domino. No two dominoes stand on one point.

Output

Print n space-separated numbers zi — the number of dominoes that will fall if Vasya pushes the i-th domino to the right (including the domino itself).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program involves segment tree operations (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`), which are not aligned with the problem's requirements. The problem requires calculating how many dominoes will fall if a given domino is pushed to the right, but the functions do not appear to handle this calculation.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
16 5
20 5
10 10
18 2
```

The expected output is:
```
3 1 4 1 
```

However, the provided code does not contain any function that processes the dominoes according to the problem statement. Instead, it seems to be dealing with segment tree operations, which are not relevant to the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

dom = []
n = int(func_1()[0])
for i in range(n):
    dom.append(func_1())
    dom[i].append(i)
    for j in range(len(dom[i])):
        dom[i][j] = int(dom[i][j])
dom.sort()
seg = 4 * n * [0]
res = n * [0]
inf = 1000 * 1000 * 100 + 10
indx = n
while indx > 0:
    indx -= 1
    res[indx] = [dom[indx][2], max(indx + 1, func_4(indx)), indx]
    print('res %d: %d' % (indx, res[indx][1]))
    func_2(indx, res[indx][1], 0, n, 1)
    log = ''
    for x in seg:
        log += str(x) + ' '
    print(log)
print(res)
res.sort()
out = ''
for i in range(n):
    out += str(res[i][1] - res[i][2]) + ' '

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and for each domino i, xi and hi are integers such that -10^8 ≤ xi ≤ 10^8 and 2 ≤ hi ≤ 10^8.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().split()
    #`sys.stdin.readline().split()` which reads a line from standard input and splits it into a list of strings
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line from standard input and returns it as a list of strings. There are no parameters accepted by this function, and it does not modify any external state. The function does not handle any edge cases such as empty input or non-string input. It simply reads a line from standard input and splits it into a list using whitespace as the delimiter.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer representing the index of the domino in the input list, val is an integer representing the number of dominoes that will fall when the i-th domino is pushed to the right, s and e are integers representing the start and end indices of the current segment in the segment tree, and x is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree.
def func_2(i, val, s, e, x):
    seg[x] = max(seg[x], val)
    if (e - s < 2) :
        return
        #The program does not return any value since no return statement is provided
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: i is an integer representing the index of the domino in the input list, val is an integer representing the number of dominoes that will fall when the i-th domino is pushed to the right, s and e are integers representing the start and end indices of the current segment in the segment tree, and x is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree; seg[x] is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `val`. The difference between `e` and `s` is greater than or equal to 2.
    m = (e + s) / 2
    if (i < m) :
        func_2(i, val, s, m, 2 * x)
    else :
        func_2(i, val, m, e, 2 * x + 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `i` is an integer representing the index of the domino in the input list, `val` is an integer representing the number of dominoes that will fall when the i-th domino is pushed to the right, `s` and `e` are integers representing the start and end indices of the current segment in the segment tree, `x` is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree, and `m` is the integer value of `(e + s) / 2`. If `i` is less than `m`, the function calls `func_2` with arguments `i`, `val`, `m`, `e`, and `2 * x`. Otherwise, the function calls `func_2` with arguments `i`, `val`, `m`, `e`, and `2 * x + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` updates a segment tree by setting the value of a specific node to the maximum of its current value and a given value `val`. It recursively traverses the segment tree based on the index `i` of the domino. If the segment `[s, e]` represented by the current node `x` is small enough (i.e., `e - s < 2`), the function does nothing and terminates early. Otherwise, it splits the segment into two halves and recursively calls itself on the appropriate half depending on whether `i` is less than the midpoint `m`. The function does not return any value and its primary action is updating the segment tree. Potential edge cases include segments where `e - s < 2`, in which case the function simply returns without updating the segment tree. There is no explicit handling for invalid input such as non-integer values for `i`, `s`, `e`, `x`, or negative values for these parameters, which could lead to incorrect behavior or crashes.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the index of a node in a segment tree, s and e are integers representing the start and end indices of the segment associated with node x, l and r are integers representing the query range [l, r].
def func_3(x, s, e, l, r):
    print('infind %d %d-%d %d-%d' % (x, s, e, l, r))
    if (s >= r or e <= l) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `x` is an integer representing the index of a node in a segment tree, `s` and `e` are integers representing the start and end indices of the segment associated with node `x`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the query range [l, r]. `s` is less than `r` and `e` is greater than `l`.
    print('passed')
    if (s == l and e == r or e - s < 2) :
        print('wtf? %d' % seg[x])
        return seg[x]
        #The program returns the value of `seg[x]` which is printed with the message 'wtf? %d'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `x` is an integer representing the index of a node in a segment tree, `s` and `e` are integers representing the start and end indices of the segment associated with node `x`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the query range [l, r], `s` is less than `r` and `e` is greater than `l`, and either `s` is not equal to `l` or `e` is not equal to `r` or `e - s` is greater than or equal to 2, and 'passed' is not printed to the console
    m = (e + s) / 2
    return max(func_3(2 * x, s, m, l, min(r, m)), func_3(2 * x + 1, m, e, max(m,
    l), r))
    #The program returns the maximum value between `func_3(2 * x, s, m, l, min(r, m))` and `func_3(2 * x + 1, m, e, max(m, l), r)` where `func_3` is a function that takes five arguments and `s` and `e` are the start and end indices of the segment associated with node `x`, `l` and `r` are the query range, and `m` is the midpoint of the segment defined by `s` and `e`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` is designed to find the maximum value within a specified query range `[l, r]` of a segment tree. It accepts parameters `x`, `s`, `e`, `l`, and `r`, where `x` is the index of the current node in the segment tree, `s` and `e` define the segment associated with node `x`, and `l` and `r` define the query range. The function returns one of three possible outcomes based on the conditions checked during its execution:

1. If the current segment `[s, e]` does not overlap with the query range `[l, r]`, the function returns 0.
2. If the current segment `[s, e]` exactly matches the query range `[l, r]` or the segment length is less than 2, the function returns the value of `seg[x]` with the message 'wtf? %d'.
3. If the current segment overlaps partially with the query range, the function recursively calculates the maximum value by splitting the segment into two halves and finding the maximum value in each half, then returning the maximum of these values.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `seg` is a global variable containing the segment tree data. This is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code or annotations.
- The function uses integer division `m = (e + s) / 2` to calculate the midpoint, which could cause issues if `s` and `e` are large and lead to precision loss due to integer arithmetic. However, since the segment tree indices are assumed to be small integers, this is likely not a significant issue.
- The function does not handle the case where `l` > `r`, although the annotations suggest that such a condition should be checked.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: dom is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (xi) and height (hi) of a domino. i is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(dom).
def func_4(i):
    [x, h] = dom[i][0:2]
    s = i
    e = n
    while e - s > 1:
        m = int((e + s) / 2)
        
        print('bs %d' % m)
        
        if dom[m][0] < x + h:
            s = m
        else:
            e = m
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (xi) and height (hi) of a domino; `x` is the coordinate (xi) of the i-th domino; `h` is the height (hi) of the i-th domino; `s` is the smallest index within the range that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h`; `e` is the largest index within the range that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h`; `m` is the integer value of \((e + s) / 2\) such that the loop terminates when `e - s <= 1`. The value 'bs %d' is printed with `%d` replaced by the value of `m` at each iteration.
    print('find %d %d - %d %d' % (i, e, x, h))
    return func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)
    #The program returns the result of `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)` where `n` is not defined in the initial state, `i` is not defined in the initial state, and `e` is the largest index within the range that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes an integer `i` as input and performs a binary search to find the largest index `e` within the range `[s, n)` that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h`, where `x` and `h` are the coordinate and height of the `i`-th domino, respectively. It then calls `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)` and returns its result. 

The function prints the middle index `m` at each iteration of the binary search process. After the binary search completes, it prints a message indicating the value of `e` and the coordinates `x` and `h` of the `i`-th domino.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the range `[s, n)` is empty, the binary search will terminate immediately with `s == e`.
- If `dom[m][0]` is never less than `x + h` during the binary search, `e` will remain `n`, which is the upper bound of the search range.

Missing functionality: The annotations and code do not handle cases where `n` or `i` might be out of bounds or undefined, which could lead to errors if not properly managed.
