Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic for determining how many dominoes will fall if a given domino is pushed to the right. Specifically, the following issues exist:

1. **Binary Search in `func_4`**: The binary search in `func_4` aims to find the largest index `e` such that the coordinate of the domino at index `m` is less than `x + h`. However, the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h` is not sufficient to determine the exact range of dominoes that will fall. The code does not account for the fact that the domino at index `e` might be the exact boundary where the falling condition changes.

2. **Segment Tree Updates in `func_2`**: The segment tree updates in `func_2` are intended to propagate the information about the falling dominoes. However, the updates are made based on the index `i` of the domino being pushed, which does not correctly reflect the range of dominoes that will fall.

3. **Segment Tree Queries in `func_3`**: The segment tree queries in `func_3` are used to determine the maximum value (i.e., the number of dominoes that will fall) within a given range. However, the segment tree updates and queries do not correctly capture the logic of the falling dominoes.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of dominoes that will fall for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
