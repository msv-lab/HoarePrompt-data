Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the coordinate `x` of a domino is greater than or equal to `x + h - 1`, meaning the domino does not cover any other dominoes to its right. Specifically, in the example provided:

```
4
16 5
20 5
10 10
18 2
```

For the fourth domino `(18, 2)`, the expected output is `1` because only this domino itself should fall. However, the code incorrectly calculates the range for the fourth domino, leading to an incorrect result. The binary search in `func_4` does not account for this scenario correctly, and thus the segment tree updates and queries do not reflect the correct logic.

To fix this, the binary search in `func_4` needs to ensure that it correctly identifies the range of dominoes affected by the current domino, including handling cases where the domino does not affect any others to its right.
