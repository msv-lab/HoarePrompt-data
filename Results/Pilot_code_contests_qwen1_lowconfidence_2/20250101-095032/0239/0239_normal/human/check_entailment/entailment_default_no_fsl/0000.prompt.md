You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya is interested in arranging dominoes. He is fed up with common dominoes and he uses the dominoes of different heights. He put n dominoes on the table along one axis, going from left to right. Every domino stands perpendicular to that axis so that the axis passes through the center of its base. The i-th domino has the coordinate xi and the height hi. Now Vasya wants to learn for every domino, how many dominoes will fall if he pushes it to the right. Help him do that. 

Consider that a domino falls if it is touched strictly above the base. In other words, the fall of the domino with the initial coordinate x and height h leads to the fall of all dominoes on the segment [x + 1, x + h - 1].

<image>

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which is the number of dominoes. Then follow n lines containing two integers xi and hi ( - 108 ≤ xi ≤ 108, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 108) each, which are the coordinate and height of every domino. No two dominoes stand on one point.

Output

Print n space-separated numbers zi — the number of dominoes that will fall if Vasya pushes the i-th domino to the right (including the domino itself).

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads a line from standard input and returns it as a list of strings. There are no parameters accepted by this function, and it does not modify any external state. The function does not handle any edge cases such as empty input or non-string input. It simply reads a line from standard input and splits it into a list using whitespace as the delimiter.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(i, val, s, e, x):
    seg[x] = max(seg[x], val)
    if e - s < 2:
        return
    m = (e + s) / 2
    if i < m:
        func_2(i, val, s, m, 2 * x)
    else:
        func_2(i, val, m, e, 2 * x + 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` updates a segment tree by setting the value of a specific node to the maximum of its current value and a given value `val`. It recursively traverses the segment tree based on the index `i` of the domino. If the segment `[s, e]` represented by the current node `x` is small enough (i.e., `e - s < 2`), the function does nothing and terminates early. Otherwise, it splits the segment into two halves and recursively calls itself on the appropriate half depending on whether `i` is less than the midpoint `m`. The function does not return any value and its primary action is updating the segment tree. Potential edge cases include segments where `e - s < 2`, in which case the function simply returns without updating the segment tree. There is no explicit handling for invalid input such as non-integer values for `i`, `s`, `e`, `x`, or negative values for these parameters, which could lead to incorrect behavior or crashes.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(x, s, e, l, r):
    print('infind %d %d-%d %d-%d' % (x, s, e, l, r))
    if s >= r or e <= l:
        return 0
    print('passed')
    if s == l and e == r or e - s < 2:
        print('wtf? %d' % seg[x])
        return seg[x]
    m = (e + s) / 2
    return max(func_3(2 * x, s, m, l, min(r, m)), func_3(2 * x + 1, m, e, max(m, l), r))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` is designed to find the maximum value within a specified query range `[l, r]` of a segment tree. It accepts parameters `x`, `s`, `e`, `l`, and `r`, where `x` is the index of the current node in the segment tree, `s` and `e` define the segment associated with node `x`, and `l` and `r` define the query range. The function returns one of three possible outcomes based on the conditions checked during its execution:

1. If the current segment `[s, e]` does not overlap with the query range `[l, r]`, the function returns 0.
2. If the current segment `[s, e]` exactly matches the query range `[l, r]` or the segment length is less than 2, the function returns the value of `seg[x]` with the message 'wtf? %d'.
3. If the current segment overlaps partially with the query range, the function recursively calculates the maximum value by splitting the segment into two halves and finding the maximum value in each half, then returning the maximum of these values.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `seg` is a global variable containing the segment tree data. This is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code or annotations.
- The function uses integer division `m = (e + s) / 2` to calculate the midpoint, which could cause issues if `s` and `e` are large and lead to precision loss due to integer arithmetic. However, since the segment tree indices are assumed to be small integers, this is likely not a significant issue.
- The function does not handle the case where `l` > `r`, although the annotations suggest that such a condition should be checked.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(i):
    [x, h] = dom[i][0:2]
    s = i
    e = n
    while e - s > 1:
        m = int((e + s) / 2)
        print('bs %d' % m)
        if dom[m][0] < x + h:
            s = m
        else:
            e = m
    print('find %d %d - %d %d' % (i, e, x, h))
    return func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` takes an integer `i` as input and performs a binary search to find the largest index `e` within the range `[s, n)` that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h`, where `x` and `h` are the coordinate and height of the `i`-th domino, respectively. It then calls `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)` and returns its result. 

The function prints the middle index `m` at each iteration of the binary search process. After the binary search completes, it prints a message indicating the value of `e` and the coordinates `x` and `h` of the `i`-th domino.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the range `[s, n)` is empty, the binary search will terminate immediately with `s == e`.
- If `dom[m][0]` is never less than `x + h` during the binary search, `e` will remain `n`, which is the upper bound of the search range.

Missing functionality: The annotations and code do not handle cases where `n` or `i` might be out of bounds or undefined, which could lead to errors if not properly managed.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
