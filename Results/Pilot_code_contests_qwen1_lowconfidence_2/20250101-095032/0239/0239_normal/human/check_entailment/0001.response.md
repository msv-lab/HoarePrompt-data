Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine how many dominoes will fall if a specific domino is pushed to the right. The main issues are:

1. **Seg Tree Implementation**: The segment tree functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) are not used correctly to solve the problem. These functions are intended to update and query the segment tree but are not properly integrated into the logic for calculating the number of falling dominoes.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_4` is flawed. It attempts to find the range of dominoes that would be affected if the i-th domino is pushed, but it does not correctly handle the calculation of the number of falling dominoes.

3. **Querying the Segment Tree**: Even if the segment tree was correctly implemented, the querying function `func_3` is not set up to return the correct number of falling dominoes. It only updates the segment tree without properly querying the relevant ranges to get the total count.

To properly solve this problem, the segment tree should be used to efficiently update and query the number of dominoes that fall when a specific domino is pushed. The binary search should correctly identify the range of dominoes that are affected, and the segment tree should be queried to get the total count of falling dominoes within that range.
