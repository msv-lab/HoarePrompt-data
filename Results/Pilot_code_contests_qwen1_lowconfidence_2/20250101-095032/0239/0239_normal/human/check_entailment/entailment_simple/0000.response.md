Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Sorting and Segment Tree Initialization**:
   - The program sorts the dominoes based on their coordinates (`dom.sort()`). However, the problem does not specify that the dominoes should be sorted by their coordinates. The sorting is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because the relative order of dominoes might change.

2. **Segment Tree Implementation**:
   - The segment tree implementation is incomplete and does not correctly propagate the results. The `func_2` function updates the segment tree but does not ensure that the propagation happens correctly for all relevant nodes.
   - The `func_3` function also has issues with its implementation. It should return the maximum number of dominoes that fall when a specific domino is pushed to the right, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Binary Search Function**:
   - The `func_4` function attempts to find the range of dominoes that would be affected if the i-th domino is pushed to the right. However, the binary search logic is flawed. Specifically, the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h` is not correct for determining the range of dominoes that will fall. The condition should be `dom[m][0] >= x + h` to correctly identify the range of dominoes that will be affected.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in the program does not correctly calculate the number of dominoes that will fall for each domino. The program does not properly update the segment tree to reflect the fall of dominoes when a domino is pushed to the right.

To summarize, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The issues with sorting, the segment tree implementation, and the binary search function all contribute to the program not meeting the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
