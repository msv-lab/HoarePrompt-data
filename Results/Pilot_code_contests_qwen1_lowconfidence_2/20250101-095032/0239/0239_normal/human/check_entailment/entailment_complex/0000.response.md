Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case where a domino is pushed to the right but there are no dominoes that fall as a result. Specifically, consider the following scenario:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  0 10
  1 5
  9 10
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3 1 3 
  ```

However, the provided code does not account for the scenario where the pushed domino does not cause any additional dominoes to fall. The function `func_2` and `func_3` update and query the segment tree, but they do not handle the case where the pushed domino does not cause any further dominoes to fall.

In the given example, if Vasya pushes the first domino (at position 0 with height 10), the third domino (at position 9 with height 10) will fall. However, the second domino (at position 1 with height 5) will not fall because it is not in the fall range of the first domino. The current implementation of `func_2` and `func_3` does not reflect this behavior accurately.

Therefore, the code fails to meet the problem description for this specific case.
