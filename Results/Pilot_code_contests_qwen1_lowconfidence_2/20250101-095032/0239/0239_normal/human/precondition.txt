The input consists of multiple lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), representing the number of dominoes. Following n lines contain two integers xi and hi (-108 ≤ xi ≤ 108, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 108) each, where xi is the coordinate and hi is the height of the i-th domino. No two dominoes share the same coordinate.
