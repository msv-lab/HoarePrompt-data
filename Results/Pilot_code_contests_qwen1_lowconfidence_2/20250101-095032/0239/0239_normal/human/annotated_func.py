def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().split()
    #`sys.stdin.readline().split()` which reads a line from standard input and splits it into a list of strings
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line from standard input and returns it as a list of strings. There are no parameters accepted by this function, and it does not modify any external state. The function does not handle any edge cases such as empty input or non-string input. It simply reads a line from standard input and splits it into a list using whitespace as the delimiter.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer representing the index of the domino in the input list, val is an integer representing the number of dominoes that will fall when the i-th domino is pushed to the right, s and e are integers representing the start and end indices of the current segment in the segment tree, and x is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree.

The difference between `e` and `s` is greater than or equal to 2.
    m = (e + s) / 2
    if (i < m) :
        func_2(i, val, s, m, 2 * x)
    else :
        func_2(i, val, m, e, 2 * x + 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `i` is an integer representing the index of the domino in the input list, `val` is an integer representing the number of dominoes that will fall when the i-th domino is pushed to the right, `s` and `e` are integers representing the start and end indices of the current segment in the segment tree, `x` is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree, and `m` is the integer value of `(e + s) / 2`. If `i` is less than `m`, the function calls `func_2` with arguments `i`, `val`, `m`, `e`, and `2 * x`. Otherwise, the function calls `func_2` with arguments `i`, `val`, `m`, `e`, and `2 * x + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` updates a segment tree by setting the value of a specific node to the maximum of its current value and a given value `val`. It recursively traverses the segment tree based on the index `i` of the domino. If the segment `[s, e]` represented by the current node `x` is small enough (i.e., `e - s < 2`), the function does nothing and terminates early. Otherwise, it splits the segment into two halves and recursively calls itself on the appropriate half depending on whether `i` is less than the midpoint `m`. The function does not return any value and its primary action is updating the segment tree. Potential edge cases include segments where `e - s < 2`, in which case the function simply returns without updating the segment tree. There is no explicit handling for invalid input such as non-integer values for `i`, `s`, `e`, `x`, or negative values for these parameters, which could lead to incorrect behavior or crashes.

    return max(func_3(2 * x, s, m, l, min(r, m)), func_3(2 * x + 1, m, e, max(m,

    #The program returns the maximum value between `func_3(2 * x, s, m, l, min(r, m))` and `func_3(2 * x + 1, m, e, max(m, l), r)` where `func_3` is a function that takes five arguments and `s` and `e` are the start and end indices of the segment associated with node `x`, `l` and `r` are the query range, and `m` is the midpoint of the segment defined by `s` and `e`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` is designed to find the maximum value within a specified query range `[l, r]` of a segment tree. It accepts parameters `x`, `s`, `e`, `l`, and `r`, where `x` is the index of the current node in the segment tree, `s` and `e` define the segment associated with node `x`, and `l` and `r` define the query range. The function returns one of three possible outcomes based on the conditions checked during its execution:

1. If the current segment `[s, e]` does not overlap with the query range `[l, r]`, the function returns 0.
2. If the current segment `[s, e]` exactly matches the query range `[l, r]` or the segment length is less than 2, the function returns the value of `seg[x]` with the message 'wtf? %d'.
3. If the current segment overlaps partially with the query range, the function recursively calculates the maximum value by splitting the segment into two halves and finding the maximum value in each half, then returning the maximum of these values.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `seg` is a global variable containing the segment tree data. This is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code or annotations.
- The function uses integer division `m = (e + s) / 2` to calculate the midpoint, which could cause issues if `s` and `e` are large and lead to precision loss due to integer arithmetic. However, since the segment tree indices are assumed to be small integers, this is likely not a significant issue.
- The function does not handle the case where `l` > `r`, although the annotations suggest that such a condition should be checked.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: dom is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (xi) and height (hi) of a domino. i is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(dom).

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (xi) and height (hi) of a domino; `x` is the coordinate (xi) of the i-th domino; `h` is the height (hi) of the i-th domino; `s` is the smallest index within the range that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h`; `e` is the largest index within the range that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h`; `m` is the integer value of \((e + s) / 2\) such that the loop terminates when `e - s <= 1`. The value 'bs %d' is printed with `%d` replaced by the value of `m` at each iteration.
    print('find %d %d - %d %d' % (i, e, x, h))
    return func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)
    #The program returns the result of `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)` where `n` is not defined in the initial state, `i` is not defined in the initial state, and `e` is the largest index within the range that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes an integer `i` as input and performs a binary search to find the largest index `e` within the range `[s, n)` that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h`, where `x` and `h` are the coordinate and height of the `i`-th domino, respectively. It then calls `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)` and returns its result. 

The function prints the middle index `m` at each iteration of the binary search process. After the binary search completes, it prints a message indicating the value of `e` and the coordinates `x` and `h` of the `i`-th domino.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the range `[s, n)` is empty, the binary search will terminate immediately with `s == e`.
- If `dom[m][0]` is never less than `x + h` during the binary search, `e` will remain `n`, which is the upper bound of the search range.

Missing functionality: The annotations and code do not handle cases where `n` or `i` might be out of bounds or undefined, which could lead to errors if not properly managed.
