Postcondition: ***`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (xi) and height (hi) of a domino; `x` is the coordinate (xi) of the i-th domino; `h` is the height (hi) of the i-th domino; `s` is the value of `i`; `e` is the value of `n`, and `e` must be at least 3 greater than `s`; `m` is the integer value of `(e + s) / 2`; the value of `m` satisfies `(dom[m][0] < x + h)`; `bs %d` is printed where `%d` is replaced by the integer value of `(e + s) / 2`***
