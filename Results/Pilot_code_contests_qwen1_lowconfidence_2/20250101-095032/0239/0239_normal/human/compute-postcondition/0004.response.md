`m` is assigned the value of `(e + s) / 2`, converted to an integer using `int()`. The values of `e` and `s` are known, but not their specific values, only that `e` is at least 3 greater than `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (xi) and height (hi) of a domino; `x` is the coordinate (xi) of the i-th domino; `h` is the height (hi) of the i-th domino; `s` is the value of `i`; `e` is the value of `n`, and `e` must be at least 3 greater than `s`; `m` is the integer value of `(e + s) / 2`**
