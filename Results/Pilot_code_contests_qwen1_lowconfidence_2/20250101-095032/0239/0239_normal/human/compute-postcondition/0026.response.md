The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `i`. The parameter `dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate \( x_i \) and height \( h_i \) of a domino. However, `dom` is not listed among the parameters of `func_4`, but rather it is assumed to be a global variable or passed in some other way.

The function returns the result of `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)`, where:
- `n` is not defined in the initial state,
- `i` is the parameter of `func_4`,
- `e` is the largest index within the range that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept an integer `i` and return the result of `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)`, where `e` is determined based on the condition involving `dom`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `i` and returns the result of `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)`, where `e` is the largest index within the range that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h`.**
