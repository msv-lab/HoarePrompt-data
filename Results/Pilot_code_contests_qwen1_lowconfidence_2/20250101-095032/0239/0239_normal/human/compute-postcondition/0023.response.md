Output State: **`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (xi) and height (hi) of a domino; `x` is the coordinate (xi) of the i-th domino; `h` is the height (hi) of the i-th domino; `s` is the smallest index within the range that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h`; `e` is the largest index within the range that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h`; `m` is the integer value of \((e + s) / 2\) such that the loop terminates when `e - s <= 1`. The value 'bs %d' is printed with `%d` replaced by the value of `m` at each iteration.**
