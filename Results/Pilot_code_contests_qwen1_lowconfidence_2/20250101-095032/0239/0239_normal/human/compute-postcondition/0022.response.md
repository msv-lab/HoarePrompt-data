Postcondition: ***`dom` is a list of lists, `x` is the coordinate of the i-th domino, `h` is the height of the i-th domino, `s` is the value of \(i\), `e` is the value of \((e + s) / 2\) or the updated value to ensure \(e - s > 1\), `m` is the integer value of \((e + s) / 2\) or the updated value to ensure \(m - s > 1\), and 'bs %d' % `m` is printed. If `dom[m][0] < x + h`, then `e` is the value of \((e + s) / 2\) or the updated value to ensure \(e - s > 1\). Otherwise, `e` is equal to `m`, which is \((e + s) / 2\) or the updated value to ensure \(m - s > 1\).***
