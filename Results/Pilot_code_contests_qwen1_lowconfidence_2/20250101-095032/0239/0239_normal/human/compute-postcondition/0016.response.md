Postcondition: ***`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (xi) and height (hi) of a domino.; `x` is the coordinate (xi) of the i-th domino.; `h` is the height (hi) of the i-th domino.; `s` is the value of \(i\); `e` is the value of \((e + s) / 2\); `m` is the integer value of \((e + s) / 2\) such that `m - s > 1`; 'bs %d' % `m` is printed; if `dom[m][0] < x + h`, then `s` is now equal to `m`. Otherwise, `s` remains the same.***
