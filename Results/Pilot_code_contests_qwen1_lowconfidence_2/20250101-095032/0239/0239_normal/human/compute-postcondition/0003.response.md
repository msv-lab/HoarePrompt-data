To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given condition and the current state:

1. **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `e - s > 1`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (xi) and height (hi) of a domino.
   - `x` is the coordinate (xi) of the i-th domino.
   - `h` is the height (hi) of the i-th domino.
   - `s` is the value of `i`.
   - `e` is the value of `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `e - s > 1` must hold true after the loop body runs once. 

Given that `s` is the starting index (`i`) and `e` is the ending index (`n`), the current condition `e - s > 1` means there must be at least three indices between `s` and `e` (inclusive of `s` but exclusive of `e`).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Condition**: `e - s > 1`
2. **Loop Execution**: After one iteration, the loop will check `e - s > 1` again. To ensure the loop continues, `e - s` should still be greater than 1 after the loop body runs.

### Required Adjustments:

- The difference `e - s` must remain greater than 1 even after the loop body runs. Since the loop body is not specified, we assume no change in `s` or `e` inside the loop body (as no additional information about the loop body is provided).
- Therefore, the only way to ensure the loop continues is to ensure that `e` is not decreased and `s` is not increased such that `e - s` becomes 1 or less.

### Conclusion:

No changes are necessary to `s` or `e` based on the given information. However, to ensure the loop can proceed, `e` must be at least 3 greater than `s` before the loop starts.

**State**: **`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (xi) and height (hi) of a domino; `x` is the coordinate (xi) of the i-th domino; `h` is the height (hi) of the i-th domino; `s` is the value of `i`; `e` is the value of `n`, and `e` must be at least 3 greater than `s`**.
