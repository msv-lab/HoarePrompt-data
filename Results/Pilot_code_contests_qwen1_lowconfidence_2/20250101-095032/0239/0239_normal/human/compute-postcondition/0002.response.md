`e` is assigned the value of `n`. The value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, so `e` takes on the value of `n`. The states of the other variables (`dom`, `x`, `h`, `s`) are not affected.

Output State: **`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (xi) and height (hi) of a domino; `x` is the coordinate (xi) of the i-th domino; `h` is the height (hi) of the i-th domino; `s` is the value of `i`; `e` is the value of `n`.**
