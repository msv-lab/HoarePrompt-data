The code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `s`. Since `i` is not defined in the given context, it implies that `i` is expected to be a valid index or a variable holding a specific value from the list `dom`. However, without knowing the exact value or context of `i`, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. But we know that `s` now holds the value of `i`.

Output State: **`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (xi) and height (hi) of a domino; `x` is the coordinate (xi) of the i-th domino; `h` is the height (hi) of the i-th domino; `s` is the value of `i`**
