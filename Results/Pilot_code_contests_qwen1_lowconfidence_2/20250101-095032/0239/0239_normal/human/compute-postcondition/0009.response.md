The code `e = m` assigns the value of `m` to `e`. The value of `m` is defined as `(e + s) / 2`. Since `e` and `s` are unchanged by this line of code, the only change is that `e` now holds the same value as `m`.

The conditions given in the initial state remain true:
- `dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (xi) and height (hi) of a domino.
- `x` is the coordinate (xi) of the i-th domino.
- `h` is the height (hi) of the i-th domino.
- `s` is the value of `i`.
- `e` is the value of `(e + s) / 2`, and it must be at least 3 greater than `s`.
- `m` is the integer value of `(e + s) / 2`.
- `dom[m][0]` is greater than or equal to `x + h`.

Since no other variables are affected, the output state is:
Output State: **`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (xi) and height (hi) of a domino; `x` is the coordinate (xi) of the i-th domino; `h` is the height (hi) of the i-th domino; `s` is the value of `i`; `e` is the value of `(e + s) / 2`; `m` is the integer value of `(e + s) / 2`; `dom[m][0]` is greater than or equal to `x + h`; `e` is equal to `m`.**
