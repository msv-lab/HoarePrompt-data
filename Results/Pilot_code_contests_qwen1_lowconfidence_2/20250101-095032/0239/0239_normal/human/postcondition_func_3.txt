The function `func_4` takes an integer `i` as input and performs a binary search to find the largest index `e` within the range `[s, n)` that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h`, where `x` and `h` are the coordinate and height of the `i`-th domino, respectively. It then calls `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)` and returns its result. 

The function prints the middle index `m` at each iteration of the binary search process. After the binary search completes, it prints a message indicating the value of `e` and the coordinates `x` and `h` of the `i`-th domino.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the range `[s, n)` is empty, the binary search will terminate immediately with `s == e`.
- If `dom[m][0]` is never less than `x + h` during the binary search, `e` will remain `n`, which is the upper bound of the search range.

Missing functionality: The annotations and code do not handle cases where `n` or `i` might be out of bounds or undefined, which could lead to errors if not properly managed.
