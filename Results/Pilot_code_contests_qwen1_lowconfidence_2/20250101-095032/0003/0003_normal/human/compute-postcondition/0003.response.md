The code defines a lambda function `rints` which reads multiple integers from standard input, splits them by spaces, and converts each string to an integer. This lambda function does not assign any values to `n` or `rstrs`. The existing values of `n` and `rstrs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rints` is a lambda function that reads multiple integers from standard input, splits them by spaces, and converts each string to an integer.**
