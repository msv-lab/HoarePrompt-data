The code defines a lambda function `rints_2d` that, when called with an argument `n`, will create a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of calling `rints()` (which reads multiple integers from standard input, splits them by spaces, and converts each string to an integer). 

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `rstrs`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, and `rint_2d` are predefined lambda functions

The lambda function `rints_2d` itself does not perform any operations that change the values of existing variables or perform input/output operations. It simply defines a new function. Therefore, the only thing that changes is the definition of `rints_2d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rints` is a lambda function that reads multiple integers from standard input, splits them by spaces, and converts each string to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` strings, each string being read from standard input using `rstr()`; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` lists, each list containing integers read from standard input using `rint()'; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` elements, each element being the result of calling `rints()`**
