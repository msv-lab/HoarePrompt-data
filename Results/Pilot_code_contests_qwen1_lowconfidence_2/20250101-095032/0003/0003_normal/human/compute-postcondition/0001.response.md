The code provided does not directly assign any values to the variables. Instead, it defines a lambda function `rstrs` which reads a line from standard input and splits it into a list of strings, stripping any trailing whitespace. This lambda function does not execute any operations that would change the values of the existing variables `n` or any other variables. 

Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the lambda function `rstrs`, which can be used later to read lines from standard input. However, since no values are read or modified in this snippet, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.**
