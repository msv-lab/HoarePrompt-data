The given code defines a lambda function `rstr` which reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This function does not assign any values to variables directly but prepares for reading input. Since no variables are explicitly modified or assigned new values within this code snippet, the only change is the introduction of the lambda function `rstr`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the following edges form a tree: for each line in the input, two integers u and v represent an edge between nodes u and v where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.**
