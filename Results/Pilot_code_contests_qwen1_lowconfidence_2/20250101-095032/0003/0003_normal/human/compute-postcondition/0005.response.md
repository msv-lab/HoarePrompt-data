The code defines a lambda function `rint_2d` which creates a list of lists by reading `n` integers from standard input. However, this code does not actually execute and read any input; it only defines the function. Therefore, the variables `n`, `rstrs`, `rints`, and `rstr_2d` remain unchanged. The output state includes these variables with their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^5; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rints` is a lambda function that reads multiple integers from standard input, splits them by spaces, and converts each string to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` strings, each string being read from standard input using `rstr()`; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` lists, each list containing integers read from standard input using `rint()`**
