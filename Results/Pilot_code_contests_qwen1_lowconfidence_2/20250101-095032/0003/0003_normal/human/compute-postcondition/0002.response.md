The code defines a lambda function `rint` which reads an integer from standard input and returns it. This does not assign a value to any existing variable but introduces a new function `rint`. The values of `n` and `rstrs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and returns it.**
