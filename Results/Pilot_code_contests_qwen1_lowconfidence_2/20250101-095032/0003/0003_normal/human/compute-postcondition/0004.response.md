The code defines a lambda function `rstr_2d` that creates a list of `n` strings, each string being read from standard input using the `rstr()` lambda function. However, since no input is provided within the code snippet itself, the function `rstr_2d` is not executed, and thus no new values are assigned to the variables. The initial values of `n`, `rstrs`, and `rints` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rints` is a lambda function that reads multiple integers from standard input, splits them by spaces, and converts each string to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` strings, each string being read from standard input using `rstr()`.**
