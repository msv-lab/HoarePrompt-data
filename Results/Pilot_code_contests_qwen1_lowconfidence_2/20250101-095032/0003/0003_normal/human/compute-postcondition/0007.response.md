The given code defines a lambda function `pr` that writes a list of arguments joined by a specified separator to standard output. This lambda function does not affect the values of any variables or perform any operations on the existing state. It simply provides a way to write formatted output.

Since no actual values or variables are modified in this code snippet, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rints` is a lambda function that reads multiple integers from standard input, splits them by spaces, and converts each string to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` strings, each string being read from standard input using `rstr()`; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` lists, each list containing integers read from standard input using `rint()'; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` elements, each element being the result of calling `rints()'; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a list of arguments joined by a specified separator to standard output.**
