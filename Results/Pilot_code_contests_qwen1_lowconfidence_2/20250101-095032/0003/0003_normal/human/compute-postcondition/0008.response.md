The code initializes an empty list named `out`. No values are assigned or modified in this code snippet, and no operations are performed that would affect the values of `n`, `rstrs`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, or `pr`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rints` is a lambda function that reads multiple integers from standard input, splits them by spaces, and converts each string to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` strings, each string being read from standard input using `rstr()'; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` lists, each list containing integers read from standard input using `rint()'; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` elements, each element being the result of calling `rints()'; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a list of arguments joined by a specified separator to standard output; `out` is an empty list.**
