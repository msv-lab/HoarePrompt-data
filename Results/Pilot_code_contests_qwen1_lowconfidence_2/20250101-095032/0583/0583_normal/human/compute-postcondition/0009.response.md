`temp` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp` is 1, so after the increment, `temp` becomes 2. The other variables (`n`, `s`, and `k`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user, `k` is `n + 1`, and `temp` is 2**
