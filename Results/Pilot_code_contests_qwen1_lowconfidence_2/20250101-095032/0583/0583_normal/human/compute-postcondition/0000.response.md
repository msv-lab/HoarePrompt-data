The code `n = input()` assigns the value of `input()` to `n`. Since `input()` reads a line of text from the user, `n` will be a string representing an integer. However, without further context or additional code to convert this string to an integer, the value of `n` remains as a string. The initial condition that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 is no longer valid because now `n` is a string.

Output State: **`n` is a string**
