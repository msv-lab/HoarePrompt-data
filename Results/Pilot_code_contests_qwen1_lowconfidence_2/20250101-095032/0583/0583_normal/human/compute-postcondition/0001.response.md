The code `s = sum(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and then sums these integers. However, since the initial state of `n` is a string, the variable `n` is not directly affected by this code. The code reads input from the user, so the output state will include the fact that `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user**
