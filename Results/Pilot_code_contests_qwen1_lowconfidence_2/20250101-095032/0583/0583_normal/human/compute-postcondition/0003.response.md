`temp` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `s`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string, `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user, `k` is `n + 1`, and `temp` is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user, `k` is `n + 1`, `temp` is `0`**
