The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the constraints, it seems that the function should process input data that includes an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers, each ranging from 1 to 5. The function's output is not specified directly in the given information, but we can infer that it might process or return something related to these inputs.

Given the structure and the constraints, the function likely reads input data and processes it according to some defined rules. Since the output is not detailed, we will focus on the input constraints and what the function is expected to handle.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, followed by `n` integers each ranging from 1 to 5, and processes this input data.**
