`temp` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp` is 0, so now `temp` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string, `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user, `k` is `n + 1`, `temp` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `s + i` is divisible by `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user, `k` is `n + 1`, `temp` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `s + i` is divisible by `k`.**
