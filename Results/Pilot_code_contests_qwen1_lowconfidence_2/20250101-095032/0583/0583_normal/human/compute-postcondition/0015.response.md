The code `print(5 - temp)` does not change any variables. It only prints the value of `5 - temp`. Since `temp` is the count of iterations where `(s + i) % k == 0`, the value of `temp` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with `5 - temp` being printed.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user, `k` is `n + 1`, `temp` is the count of iterations where `(s + i) % k == 0`, and the value `5 - temp` is printed.**
