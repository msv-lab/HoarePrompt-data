State: **`n` is a string, `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user, `k` is `n + 1`, `temp` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be an integer greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop starts with `i` ranging from 0 to 4. For the loop to start executing, `i` must be 0 (the initial value before the first iteration).
2. The variable `n` must be convertible to an integer and greater than 0 for the range function to work correctly. Since `n` is initially a string, it needs to be an integer and greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is 1 (ready for the first iteration) and `n` must be an integer greater than 0.
