`k` is assigned the value of `n + 1`. Since `n` is a string, adding 1 to it results in a TypeError because you cannot directly add an integer to a string. However, according to the instructions, we should assume that the code runs as provided, which means `k` will be `n + 1` (considering the string concatenation behavior). The value of `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user, `k` is `n + 1`**
