`temp` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp` is the same as the value before the code was executed, which means `temp` is now one more than its previous value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, and `k`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user, `k` is `n + 1`, `temp` is `temp + 1`**
