Functionality: The function accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), followed by `n` integers each ranging from 1 to 5. It calculates the sum of these integers and then counts how many times the sum plus an index `i` (where \(0 \leq i < 5\)) is divisible by `n + 1`. The function finally prints the number of times this condition is not satisfied, which is \(5 - \text{count}\). 

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 1, the value of `k` becomes 2. The function will check if `s + i` is divisible by 2 for \(i\) in the range [0, 4].
- If `n` is 100, the value of `k` becomes 101. The function will check if `s + i` is divisible by 101 for \(i\) in the range [0, 4].

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code assumes that the input for `n` and the subsequent `n` integers are valid. There is no validation to ensure that `n` is within the specified range or that the integers entered are between 1 and 5. If these conditions are not met, the function may produce incorrect results or raise errors.
