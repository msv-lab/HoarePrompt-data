You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Dima and his friends have been playing hide and seek at Dima's place all night. As a result, Dima's place got messy. In the morning they decided that they need to clean the place.

To decide who exactly would clean the apartment, the friends want to play a counting-out game. First, all the guys stand in a circle, and then each of them shows some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), and then the boys count in a circle, starting from Dima, the number of people, respective to the total number of fingers shown. The person on who the countdown stops will clean the apartment.

For example, if Dima and one of his friends played hide and seek, and 7 fingers were shown during the counting-out, then Dima would clean the place. If there were 2 or say, 8 fingers shown, then his friend would clean the place.

Dima knows how many fingers each of his friends will show during the counting-out. Now he is interested in the number of ways to show some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), so that he did not have to clean the place. Help Dima.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of Dima's friends. Dima himself isn't considered to be his own friend. The second line contains n positive integers, not exceeding 5, representing, how many fingers the Dima's friends will show. 

The numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.

Output

In a single line print the answer to the problem.

Examples

Input

Output

3


Input

2


Output

2


Input

2
3 5


Output

3

Note

In the first sample Dima can show 1, 3 or 5 fingers. If Dima shows 3 fingers, then the counting-out will go like that: Dima, his friend, Dima, his friend.

In the second sample Dima can show 2 or 4 fingers.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers, each ranging from 1 to 5.
def func():
    n = input()
    s = sum(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(5):
        if (s + i) % k == 0:
            temp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string, `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user, `k` is `n + 1`, and `temp` is the count of iterations where `(s + i) % k == 0`.
    print(5 - temp)
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), followed by `n` integers each ranging from 1 to 5. It calculates the sum of these integers and then counts how many times the sum plus an index `i` (where \(0 \leq i < 5\)) is divisible by `n + 1`. The function finally prints the number of times this condition is not satisfied, which is \(5 - \text{count}\). 

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 1, the value of `k` becomes 2. The function will check if `s + i` is divisible by 2 for \(i\) in the range [0, 4].
- If `n` is 100, the value of `k` becomes 101. The function will check if `s + i` is divisible by 101 for \(i\) in the range [0, 4].

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code assumes that the input for `n` and the subsequent `n` integers are valid. There is no validation to ensure that `n` is within the specified range or that the integers entered are between 1 and 5. If these conditions are not met, the function may produce incorrect results or raise errors.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
