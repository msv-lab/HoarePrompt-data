Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to accurately determine the number of ways Dima can show his fingers such that he does not have to clean the apartment.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Fingers Showing by Friends:**
   - The program sums the number of fingers shown by Dima's friends, but the problem description does not specify that the friends' fingers should be summed. Instead, the problem requires counting the number of valid finger configurations for Dima out of the possible 5 (1 through 5).

2. **Incorrect Logic for Valid Finger Configurations:**
   - The program uses a loop to iterate over possible finger configurations (0 to 4) and checks if `(s + i) % k == 0`. Here, `s` is the sum of the fingers shown by Dima's friends, and `k` is `n + 1`. However, the problem requires counting how many times Dima can show his fingers such that the condition `(s + Dima's fingers) % k != 0` holds true.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `5 - temp`, where `temp` is the count of valid configurations where `(s + i) % k == 0`. This calculation is incorrect because it should output the count of configurations where `(s + i) % k != 0`.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sum the number of fingers shown by Dima's friends.
2. Iterate over all possible configurations of fingers Dima can show (1 through 5).
3. Check if `(sum_of_friends_fingers + Dima's fingers) % (n + 1) != 0`.
4. Count the number of valid configurations.
5. Print the count of valid configurations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = sum(map(int, input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):  # Dima can show 1 to 5 fingers
        if (s + i) % k != 0:
            temp += 1
    print(temp)

func()
```

This corrected version properly implements the logic required by the problem description and will output the correct number of valid finger configurations for Dima.
