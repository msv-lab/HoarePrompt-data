Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that he does not have to clean the place. Specifically, the program calculates the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that the total sum of fingers plus Dima's fingers does not lead to him being counted out, which is not the requirement.

The program logic incorrectly counts the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that the total sum modulo \(k\) (where \(k = n + 1\)) does not equal zero. This approach does not consider all possible valid cases where Dima can show fingers without being counted out.

For example, in the third test case where the input is:
```
2
3 5
```
The program output is `3`, but the correct answer should be `2`. Here, Dima can show 1 or 3 fingers, as these are the only values that ensure he is not the one counted out. The program incorrectly counts other values as well.

To fix this, the program should check for all possible values Dima can show (1 to 5) and count those values where the total sum of fingers modulo \(k\) is not zero.
