Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires determining the number of ways Dima can show a number of fingers (1 to 5) such that the counting-out process does not land on him. However, the current implementation does not accurately reflect this logic.

The code calculates the sum of the fingers shown by Dima's friends and checks how many times the sum plus an index `i` (where `i` is the number of fingers Dima shows) is divisible by `n + 1`. This does not directly solve the problem because it does not consider the positions of the friends relative to Dima.

A correct approach would involve calculating the total number of fingers shown by Dima's friends and then determining the number of possible values for the number of fingers Dima can show such that the counting-out process does not land on him. The current implementation fails to account for this correctly and instead focuses on a different aspect of the problem.

Here is a more accurate solution:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = sum(map(int, input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):
        if (s + i) % k != 0:
            temp += 1
    print(temp)

func()
```

This solution correctly counts the number of ways Dima can show a number of fingers such that the counting-out process does not land on him.
