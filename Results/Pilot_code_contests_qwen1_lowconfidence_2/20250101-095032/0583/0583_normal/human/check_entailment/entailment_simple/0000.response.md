Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it is incorrect:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of friends (`n`) and the fingers shown by each friend.
   - However, the input handling should ensure that `n` is an integer and that the subsequent input values are valid integers between 1 and 5. The current implementation does not validate these conditions.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the fingers shown by the friends (`s`).

3. **Logic Error**:
   - The core logic of the program checks for the number of ways Dima can show fingers (1 to 5) such that he does not have to clean the apartment.
   - Specifically, it iterates over possible numbers of fingers Dima could show (0 to 4, corresponding to 1 to 5 fingers) and checks if `(s + i) % (n + 1) != 0`. 
   - However, this logic is incorrect because it counts the number of ways Dima would not have to clean the apartment, which is not what the problem requires. Instead, it should count the number of ways Dima would have to clean the apartment and subtract this from 5.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints `5 - temp`, which gives the number of ways Dima does not have to clean the apartment. This is the opposite of what the problem asks for. The problem requires printing the number of ways Dima does have to clean the apartment.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = sum(map(int, input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(5):
        if (s + i) % k == 0:
            temp += 1
    
    # Calculate the number of ways Dima has to clean the apartment
    print(temp)

func()
```

### Explanation of Correctness:

- The corrected program correctly calculates the sum of the fingers shown by the friends.
- It iterates over the possible numbers of fingers Dima could show (0 to 4) and counts the number of times the condition `(s + i) % (n + 1) == 0` is true.
- Finally, it prints the count of such cases, which represents the number of ways Dima has to clean the apartment.

Thus, the original program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
