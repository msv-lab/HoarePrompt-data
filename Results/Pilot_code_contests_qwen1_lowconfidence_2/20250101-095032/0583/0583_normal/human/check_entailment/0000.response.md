Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the total number of fingers shown is such that it perfectly divides the number of people including Dima. Specifically, the program does not account for the case where the total number of fingers plus the number of fingers Dima shows is divisible by the total number of people (including Dima).

For example, consider the following input:
- Number of friends: 2
- Fingers shown by friends: 3, 5

The total number of fingers shown is \(3 + 5 = 8\). Including Dima, there are 3 people in total. The program checks for the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that \((8 + i) \% 3 \neq 0\). However, if Dima shows 2 fingers, then \((8 + 2) \% 3 = 0\), meaning Dima would be chosen to clean the apartment, which is not desired.

The correct approach should ensure that Dima does not get selected, so we need to count the number of ways where \((8 + i) \% 3 \neq 0\) for \(i\) in the range [1, 5]. The program incorrectly returns the complement of this count, leading to an incorrect solution in certain scenarios.
