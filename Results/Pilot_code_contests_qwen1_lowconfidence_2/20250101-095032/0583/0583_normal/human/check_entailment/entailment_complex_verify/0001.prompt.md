You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dima and his friends have been playing hide and seek at Dima's place all night. As a result, Dima's place got messy. In the morning they decided that they need to clean the place.

To decide who exactly would clean the apartment, the friends want to play a counting-out game. First, all the guys stand in a circle, and then each of them shows some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), and then the boys count in a circle, starting from Dima, the number of people, respective to the total number of fingers shown. The person on who the countdown stops will clean the apartment.

For example, if Dima and one of his friends played hide and seek, and 7 fingers were shown during the counting-out, then Dima would clean the place. If there were 2 or say, 8 fingers shown, then his friend would clean the place.

Dima knows how many fingers each of his friends will show during the counting-out. Now he is interested in the number of ways to show some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), so that he did not have to clean the place. Help Dima.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of Dima's friends. Dima himself isn't considered to be his own friend. The second line contains n positive integers, not exceeding 5, representing, how many fingers the Dima's friends will show. 

The numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.

Output

In a single line print the answer to the problem.

Output

Note

In the first sample Dima can show 1, 3 or 5 fingers. If Dima shows 3 fingers, then the counting-out will go like that: Dima, his friend, Dima, his friend.

In the second sample Dima can show 2 or 4 fingers.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    s = sum(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(5):
        if (s + i) % k == 0:
            temp += 1
    print(5 - temp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that he does not have to clean the place. Specifically, the program calculates the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that the total sum of fingers plus Dima's fingers does not lead to him being counted out, which is not the requirement.

The program logic incorrectly counts the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that the total sum modulo \(k\) (where \(k = n + 1\)) does not equal zero. This approach does not consider all possible valid cases where Dima can show fingers without being counted out.

For example, in the third test case where the input is:
```
2
3 5
```
The program output is `3`, but the correct answer should be `2`. Here, Dima can show 1 or 3 fingers, as these are the only values that ensure he is not the one counted out. The program incorrectly counts other values as well.

To fix this, the program should check for all possible values Dima can show (1 to 5) and count those values where the total sum of fingers modulo \(k\) is not zero.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers, each ranging from 1 to 5.
def func():
    n = input()
    s = sum(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(5):
        if (s + i) % k == 0:
            temp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string, `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user, `k` is `n + 1`, and `temp` is the count of iterations where `(s + i) % k == 0`.
    print(5 - temp)
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), followed by `n` integers each ranging from 1 to 5. It calculates the sum of these integers and then counts how many times the sum plus an index `i` (where \(0 \leq i < 5\)) is divisible by `n + 1`. The function finally prints the number of times this condition is not satisfied, which is \(5 - \text{count}\). 

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 1, the value of `k` becomes 2. The function will check if `s + i` is divisible by 2 for \(i\) in the range [0, 4].
- If `n` is 100, the value of `k` becomes 101. The function will check if `s + i` is divisible by 101 for \(i\) in the range [0, 4].

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code assumes that the input for `n` and the subsequent `n` integers are valid. There is no validation to ensure that `n` is within the specified range or that the integers entered are between 1 and 5. If these conditions are not met, the function may produce incorrect results or raise errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
