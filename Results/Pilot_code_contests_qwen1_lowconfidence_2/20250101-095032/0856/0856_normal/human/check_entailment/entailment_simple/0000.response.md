Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the calculation of the minimal number of colors required to color the brackets in the text. Let's break down why:

1. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The program calculates `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, `left_max`, and `right_max`. However, the logic used to determine the minimal number of colors is flawed. The current implementation checks if `left_sum[cursor_pos] + right_sum[cursor_pos + 1] == 0` and both `left_min[cursor_pos] >= 0` and `right_min[cursor_pos] >= 0`. If these conditions are met, it assigns `max(left_max[cursor_pos], right_max[cursor_pos])` as the answer. This approach does not correctly account for nested brackets and the requirement that non-nested brackets can be colored with the same color.

2. **Bracket Coloring Logic**: The problem requires the program to correctly calculate the minimal number of colors needed to color the brackets such that no two nested brackets share the same color. The current implementation does not properly handle this requirement. For example, consider the input sequence `((())())`. The program should output `3` because there are three distinct sets of nested brackets, requiring three different colors. However, the current logic does not capture this complexity.

3. **Cursor and Context Management**: While the program correctly updates the cursor position and the context values, it does not use these values effectively to determine the minimal number of colors. The current logic does not properly track the nesting depth or the need for different colors for nested brackets.

To fix these issues, the program needs to maintain a stack-based approach to keep track of the opening and closing brackets and their nesting levels. Hereâ€™s a simplified explanation of how the correct solution could be implemented:

- Use a stack to keep track of the positions of opening brackets.
- When a closing bracket is encountered, pop the stack and ensure that the correct number of colors is updated based on the nesting level.
- Track the minimum and maximum values for each position to determine the minimal number of colors required.

Given these issues, the current implementation does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is marked as incorrect.
