Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the edge case where the cursor is at the end of the line and a closing bracket `)` is added. This results in an incorrect count of the minimum number of colors needed for bracket coloring.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:
```
5
RR)a(
```

Expected output:
```
-1 -1 -1 -1 2
```

However, the current implementation will produce:
```
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1
```

This happens because the code does not properly update the `right_sum` and related variables when the cursor is at the end of the line and a closing bracket is added. Specifically, the `right_sum` array is not updated correctly in such scenarios, leading to incorrect calculations of the minimum number of colors.

Here is an example that highlights the issue:

1. Initial state: `R`
   - Cursor at position 1.
   - `left_sum[1] = 0`, `right_sum[1] = 0`.
   
2. Command: `R`
   - Cursor moves to position 2.
   - `left_sum[2] = 0`, `right_sum[2] = 0`.

3. Command: `R`
   - Cursor moves to position 3.
   - `left_sum[3] = 0`, `right_sum[3] = 0`.

4. Command: `)`
   - Cursor is at position 3.
   - `context[3] = -1`.
   - `left_sum[3] = 0 + (-1) = -1`.
   - `right_sum[3] = 0 + 0 = 0`.

5. Command: `a`
   - Cursor is at position 3.
   - `context[3] = -1`.
   - `left_sum[3] = -1 + (-1) = -2`.
   - `right_sum[3] = 0 + 0 = 0`.

At this point, the condition `left_sum[cursor_pos] + right_sum[cursor_pos + 1] == 0` fails, but the code incorrectly sets `ans` to `-1` instead of recalculating the minimum number of colors correctly.

To fix this, you need to ensure that the `right_sum` and related variables are updated correctly even when the cursor is at the end of the line.
