Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the logic for determining whether the current text is a correct text and calculating the minimal number of colors needed to color the brackets. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Bracket Sequence Validation**:
   - The program uses `left_sum` and `right_sum` to track the cumulative sums of the context array. However, it does not validate the entire text against the rules of a correct text. It only checks the condition `left_sum[cursor_pos] + right_sum[cursor_pos + 1] == 0 and left_min[cursor_pos] >= 0 and (right_min[cursor_pos] >= 0)`, which is not sufficient to determine if the text is a correct text according to the problem description.

2. **Minimal Number of Colors Calculation**:
   - The logic to calculate the minimal number of colors is based on the `left_max` and `right_max` values. While these values are calculated correctly, the condition used to determine the minimal number of colors is not comprehensive enough. The program does not ensure that all nested pairs of brackets are colored differently, which is a requirement for a correct solution.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- Input: `11 (R)aR)L)`

- Expected Output: `-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 2`

- Actual Output: `-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 1 -1 -1 2`

The program incorrectly prints `1` for the state after `R)aR)`. According to the problem description, the text should be checked for correctness after each command, and the minimal number of colors should be calculated only if the text is correct. The program does not properly validate the text and thus fails to produce the correct output.

In summary, the program does not correctly implement the validation of the text and the calculation of the minimal number of colors, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
