You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The development of a text editor is a hard problem. You need to implement an extra module for brackets coloring in text.

Your editor consists of a line with infinite length and cursor, which points to the current character. Please note that it points to only one of the characters (and not between a pair of characters). Thus, it points to an index character. The user can move the cursor left or right one position. If the cursor is already at the first (leftmost) position, then it does not move left.

Initially, the cursor is in the first (leftmost) character.

Also, the user can write a letter or brackets (either (, or )) to the position that the cursor is currently pointing at. A new character always overwrites the old value at that position.

Your editor must check, whether the current line is the correct text. Text is correct if the brackets in them form the correct bracket sequence.

Formally, correct text (CT) must satisfy the following rules: 

  * any line without brackets is CT (the line can contain whitespaces); 
  * If the first character of the string — is (, the last — is ), and all the rest form a CT, then the whole line is a CT; 
  * two consecutively written CT is also CT. 



Examples of correct texts: hello(codeforces), round, ((i)(write))edi(tor)s, ( me). Examples of incorrect texts: hello)oops(, round), ((me).

The user uses special commands to work with your editor. Each command has its symbol, which must be written to execute this command.

The correspondence of commands and characters is as follows: 

  * L — move the cursor one character to the left (remains in place if it already points to the first character); 
  * R — move the cursor one character to the right; 
  * any lowercase Latin letter or bracket (( or )) — write the entered character to the position where the cursor is now. 



For a complete understanding, take a look at the first example and its illustrations in the note below.

You are given a string containing the characters that the user entered. For the brackets coloring module's work, after each command you need to:

  * check if the current text in the editor is a correct text; 
  * if it is, print the least number of colors that required, to color all brackets. 



If two pairs of brackets are nested (the first in the second or vice versa), then these pairs of brackets should be painted in different colors. If two pairs of brackets are not nested, then they can be painted in different or the same colors. For example, for the bracket sequence ()(())()() the least number of colors is 2, and for the bracket sequence (()(()())())(()) — is 3.

Write a program that prints the minimal number of colors after processing each command.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the number of commands. 

The second line contains s — a sequence of commands. The string s consists of n characters. It is guaranteed that all characters in a string are valid commands.

Output

In a single line print n integers, where the i-th number is:

  * -1 if the line received after processing the first i commands is not valid text, 
  * the minimal number of colors in the case of the correct text. 

Examples

Input


11
(RaRbR)L)L(


Output


-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 1 -1 -1 2 

Input


11
(R)R(R)Ra)c


Output


-1 -1 1 1 -1 -1 1 1 1 -1 1 

Note

In the first example, the text in the editor will take the following form:

  1.     (  
    ^

  2.     (  
     ^

  3.     (a  
     ^

  4.     (a  
      ^

  5.     (ab  
      ^

  6.     (ab  
       ^

  7.     (ab)  
       ^

  8.     (ab)  
      ^

  9.     (a))  
      ^

  10.     (a))  
     ^

  11.     (())  
     ^

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining whether the text is a correct text and calculating the minimum number of colors needed for bracket coloring. Specifically, the conditions used to check if the text is correct and the calculation of the minimum number of colors are flawed.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input sequence of commands: `RR(L)LR)`

Let's trace through the execution step-by-step:

1. Initial state:
   - Cursor position: 1
   - Line: ``

2. After 'R':
   - Cursor position: 2
   - Line: `(`
   - Left sum: [0, 1, 0, 0, ...]
   - Right sum: [0, 0, 0, 0, ...]
   - Context: [0, 1, 0, 0, ...]

3. After 'R':
   - Cursor position: 3
   - Line: `( (`
   - Left sum: [0, 1, 2, 0, ...]
   - Right sum: [0, 0, 0, 0, ...]
   - Context: [0, 1, 1, 0, ...]

4. After '(':
   - Cursor position: 4
   - Line: `( ( (`
   - Left sum: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0, ...]
   - Right sum: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]
   - Context: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...]

5. After 'L':
   - Cursor position: 3
   - Line: `( ( (`
   - Left sum: [0, 1, 2, 0, ...]
   - Right sum: [0, 0, 0, 0, ...]
   - Context: [0, 1, 1, 0, ...]

6. After 'R':
   - Cursor position: 4
   - Line: `( ( ( )`
   - Left sum: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0, ...]
   - Right sum: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]
   - Context: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...]

7. After ')':
   - Cursor position: 5
   - Line: `( ( ( ) )`
   - Left sum: [0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 0, ...]
   - Right sum: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]
   - Context: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...]

At the end, the line `( ( ( ) )` is not a correct text because it does not follow the rules specified in the problem description. However, the program outputs 1 as the minimum number of colors needed, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all cases and is thus incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) representing the number of commands. The second line contains a string s of length n consisting of valid commands (L, R, lowercase Latin letters, (, and )).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    operations = raw_input()
    ans_list = []
    operator_map = {'(': 1, ')': -1}
    left_sum = [(0) for i in xrange(n + 2)]
    right_sum = [(0) for i in xrange(n + 2)]
    left_min = [(0) for i in xrange(n + 2)]
    right_min = [(0) for i in xrange(n + 2)]
    left_max = [(0) for i in xrange(n + 2)]
    right_max = [(0) for i in xrange(n + 2)]
    cursor_pos = 1
    context = [(0) for i in xrange(n + 2)]
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'L':
            cursor_pos = max(1, cursor_pos - 1)
        elif op == 'R':
            cursor_pos += 1
        else:
            op_val = operator_map.get(op, 0)
            context[cursor_pos] = op_val
        
        left_sum[cursor_pos] = left_sum[cursor_pos - 1] + context[cursor_pos]
        
        right_sum[cursor_pos] = right_sum[cursor_pos + 1] + right_sum[cursor_pos]
        
        left_min[cursor_pos] = min(left_min[cursor_pos - 1], context[cursor_pos])
        
        right_min[cursor_pos] = min(right_min[cursor_pos + 1], context[cursor_pos])
        
        left_max[cursor_pos] = max(left_max[cursor_pos - 1], context[cursor_pos])
        
        right_max[cursor_pos] = max(right_max[cursor_pos + 1], context[cursor_pos])
        
        ans = -1
        
        if left_sum[cursor_pos] + right_sum[cursor_pos + 1] == 0 and left_min[
            cursor_pos] >= 0 and right_min[cursor_pos] >= 0:
            ans = max(left_max[cursor_pos], right_max[cursor_pos])
        
        ans_list.append(ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string; `ans_list` is a list of length equal to the length of `operations`; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element is the cumulative sum of `context` values up to that position; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element is the minimum value encountered from that position to the end; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element is the maximum value encountered from that position to the end; `cursor_pos` is the final position after executing all operations; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element is either 0, 1, or -1 based on the operation; `left_sum[cursor_pos]` is the cumulative sum up to `cursor_pos`; `right_sum[cursor_pos]` is the cumulative sum from `cursor_pos + 1` to the end; `left_min[cursor_pos]` is the minimum value from the start to `cursor_pos`; `right_min[cursor_pos]` is the minimum value from `cursor_pos + 1` to the end; `left_max[cursor_pos]` is the maximum value from the start to `cursor_pos`; `right_max[cursor_pos]` is the maximum value from `cursor_pos + 1` to the end; `ans_list[i]` is the maximum value between `left_max[cursor_pos]` and `right_max[cursor_pos]` when the condition `left_sum[cursor_pos] + right_sum[cursor_pos + 1] == 0 and left_min[cursor_pos] >= 0 and (right_min[cursor_pos] >= 0)` is met, otherwise `-1`.
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans_list)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of commands on a string of characters and calculates the maximum value under certain conditions. Specifically, it accepts a string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is between 1 and \(10^6\), and `s` consists of commands ('L', 'R') and parentheses ('(', ')'). It moves a cursor through the string based on these commands, updating a context array and various sum, minimum, and maximum arrays along the way. The function then determines the maximum value between the left and right segments of the context array that meet specific criteria: the sum of the left segment plus the sum of the right segment must be zero, and both the minimum values of the left and right segments must be non-negative. Finally, it prints a list of these maximum values for each command in the string. Potential edge cases include invalid commands or an empty string, though the code handles only valid inputs as per the given annotations.
