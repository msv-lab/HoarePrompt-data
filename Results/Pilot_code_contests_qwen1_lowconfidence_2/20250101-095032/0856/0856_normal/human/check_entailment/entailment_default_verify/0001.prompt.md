You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The development of a text editor is a hard problem. You need to implement an extra module for brackets coloring in text.

Your editor consists of a line with infinite length and cursor, which points to the current character. Please note that it points to only one of the characters (and not between a pair of characters). Thus, it points to an index character. The user can move the cursor left or right one position. If the cursor is already at the first (leftmost) position, then it does not move left.

Initially, the cursor is in the first (leftmost) character.

Also, the user can write a letter or brackets (either (, or )) to the position that the cursor is currently pointing at. A new character always overwrites the old value at that position.

Your editor must check, whether the current line is the correct text. Text is correct if the brackets in them form the correct bracket sequence.

Formally, correct text (CT) must satisfy the following rules: 

  * any line without brackets is CT (the line can contain whitespaces); 
  * If the first character of the string — is (, the last — is ), and all the rest form a CT, then the whole line is a CT; 
  * two consecutively written CT is also CT. 



Examples of correct texts: hello(codeforces), round, ((i)(write))edi(tor)s, ( me). Examples of incorrect texts: hello)oops(, round), ((me).

The user uses special commands to work with your editor. Each command has its symbol, which must be written to execute this command.

The correspondence of commands and characters is as follows: 

  * L — move the cursor one character to the left (remains in place if it already points to the first character); 
  * R — move the cursor one character to the right; 
  * any lowercase Latin letter or bracket (( or )) — write the entered character to the position where the cursor is now. 



For a complete understanding, take a look at the first example and its illustrations in the note below.

You are given a string containing the characters that the user entered. For the brackets coloring module's work, after each command you need to:

  * check if the current text in the editor is a correct text; 
  * if it is, print the least number of colors that required, to color all brackets. 



If two pairs of brackets are nested (the first in the second or vice versa), then these pairs of brackets should be painted in different colors. If two pairs of brackets are not nested, then they can be painted in different or the same colors. For example, for the bracket sequence ()(())()() the least number of colors is 2, and for the bracket sequence (()(()())())(()) — is 3.

Write a program that prints the minimal number of colors after processing each command.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the number of commands. 

The second line contains s — a sequence of commands. The string s consists of n characters. It is guaranteed that all characters in a string are valid commands.

Output

In a single line print n integers, where the i-th number is:

  * -1 if the line received after processing the first i commands is not valid text, 
  * the minimal number of colors in the case of the correct text. 

Examples

Input


11
(RaRbR)L)L(


Output


-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 1 -1 -1 2 

Input


11
(R)R(R)Ra)c


Output


-1 -1 1 1 -1 -1 1 1 1 -1 1 

Note

In the first example, the text in the editor will take the following form:

  1.     (  
    ^

  2.     (  
     ^

  3.     (a  
     ^

  4.     (a  
      ^

  5.     (ab  
      ^

  6.     (ab  
       ^

  7.     (ab)  
       ^

  8.     (ab)  
      ^

  9.     (a))  
      ^

  10.     (a))  
     ^

  11.     (())  
     ^

        ans_list.append(ans)
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans_list)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the edge case where the cursor is at the end of the line and a closing bracket `)` is added. This results in an incorrect count of the minimum number of colors needed for bracket coloring.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:
```
5
RR)a(
```

Expected output:
```
-1 -1 -1 -1 2
```

However, the current implementation will produce:
```
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1
```

This happens because the code does not properly update the `right_sum` and related variables when the cursor is at the end of the line and a closing bracket is added. Specifically, the `right_sum` array is not updated correctly in such scenarios, leading to incorrect calculations of the minimum number of colors.

Here is an example that highlights the issue:

1. Initial state: `R`
   - Cursor at position 1.
   - `left_sum[1] = 0`, `right_sum[1] = 0`.
   
2. Command: `R`
   - Cursor moves to position 2.
   - `left_sum[2] = 0`, `right_sum[2] = 0`.

3. Command: `R`
   - Cursor moves to position 3.
   - `left_sum[3] = 0`, `right_sum[3] = 0`.

4. Command: `)`
   - Cursor is at position 3.
   - `context[3] = -1`.
   - `left_sum[3] = 0 + (-1) = -1`.
   - `right_sum[3] = 0 + 0 = 0`.

5. Command: `a`
   - Cursor is at position 3.
   - `context[3] = -1`.
   - `left_sum[3] = -1 + (-1) = -2`.
   - `right_sum[3] = 0 + 0 = 0`.

At this point, the condition `left_sum[cursor_pos] + right_sum[cursor_pos + 1] == 0` fails, but the code incorrectly sets `ans` to `-1` instead of recalculating the minimum number of colors correctly.

To fix this, you need to ensure that the `right_sum` and related variables are updated correctly even when the cursor is at the end of the line.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a series of commands on a string of characters and calculates the maximum value under certain conditions. Specifically, it accepts a string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is between 1 and \(10^6\), and `s` consists of commands ('L', 'R') and parentheses ('(', ')'). It moves a cursor through the string based on these commands, updating a context array and various sum, minimum, and maximum arrays along the way. The function then determines the maximum value between the left and right segments of the context array that meet specific criteria: the sum of the left segment plus the sum of the right segment must be zero, and both the minimum values of the left and right segments must be non-negative. Finally, it prints a list of these maximum values for each command in the string. Potential edge cases include invalid commands or an empty string, though the code handles only valid inputs as per the given annotations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
