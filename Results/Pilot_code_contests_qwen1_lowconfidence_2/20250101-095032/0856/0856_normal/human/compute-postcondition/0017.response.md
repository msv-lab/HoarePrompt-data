The code `cursor_pos += 1` increments the value of `cursor_pos` by 1. Initially, `cursor_pos` is set to 1. Therefore, after executing this line of code, `cursor_pos` will be 2.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is 2; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; the operation `op` is 'R'.**
