The given code prints the elements of the `ans_list` using `print(' '.join(map(str, ans_list)))`. This does not change any of the variables in the initial state; it only prints their values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string; `ans_list` is a list of length equal to the length of `operations`; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element is the cumulative sum of `context` values up to that position; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element is the minimum value encountered from that position to the end; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element is the maximum value encountered from that position to the end; `cursor_pos` is the final position after executing all operations; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element is either 0, 1, or -1 based on the operation; `left_sum[cursor_pos]` is the cumulative sum up to `cursor_pos`; `right_sum[cursor_pos]` is the cumulative sum from `cursor_pos + 1` to the end; `left_min[cursor_pos]` is the minimum value from the start to `cursor_pos`; `right_min[cursor_pos]` is the minimum value from `cursor_pos + 1` to the end; `left_max[cursor_pos]` is the maximum value from the start to `cursor_pos`; `right_max[cursor_pos]` is the maximum value from `cursor_pos + 1` to the end; `ans_list[i]` is the maximum value between `left_max[cursor_pos]` and `right_max[cursor_pos]` when the condition `left_sum[cursor_pos] + right_sum[cursor_pos + 1] == 0 and left_min[cursor_pos] >= 0 and (right_min[cursor_pos] >= 0)` is met, otherwise `-1`. The print statement does not alter these variables or their relationships.**
