Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive.
- `operations` is the input string provided by the user.
- `ans_list` is an empty list.
- `operator_map` is a dictionary where `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`.
- `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `cursor_pos` is 1.
- `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.

### For Loop
The loop iterates over each character (`op`) in the `operations` string.

### Loop Execution Conditions
To execute the loop, the `operations` string must contain at least one character. The loop will start as long as there are characters left to process in the `operations` string.

### Adjusting the States
For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `operations` is non-empty. Hereâ€™s how we can adjust the states:

- Since `operations` must have at least one character for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `operations` is not an empty string.

### Final State Adjustment
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` must be a non-empty string; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.**

This ensures that the loop can start executing because the `operations` string is not empty.
