The code initializes a list called `left_sum` with `n + 2` elements, each set to 0. This impacts the variable `left_sum` by assigning it a new list of zeros. The other variables (`n`, `operations`, `ans_list`, and `operator_map`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive; `operations` is the input string provided by the user; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0**
