The code initializes `right_min` as a list of length `n + 2` with each element set to 0. This overwrites the previously defined `right_sum` list, which was also of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0. However, since `right_sum` is no longer being used and only `right_min` is affected, we focus on updating `right_min`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive; `operations` is the input string provided by the user; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.**
