The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input stream, which consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) representing the number of commands. The second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of valid commands (L, R, lowercase Latin letters, (, and )). Based on this input, the function processes the commands and returns a result. However, since the specific return value is not detailed in the given output cases, we will focus on the input description.
