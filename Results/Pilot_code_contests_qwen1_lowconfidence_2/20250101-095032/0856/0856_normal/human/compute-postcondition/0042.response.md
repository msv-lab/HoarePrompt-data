Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the impact step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive.
   - `operations` is a non-empty string with one less character.
   - `ans_list` is `[-1]`.
   - `operator_map` is `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`.
   - `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
   - `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
   - `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with `right_max[1]` equal to 0.
   - `cursor_pos` is either 1 or 3 depending on whether `op` is 'R' or not.
   - `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with `context[1]` equal to 0 (if `op` is 'R') or `context[1]` equal to 0 and `context[2]` equal to `op_val` (if `op` is not 'R').
   - `left_sum[1]` is 0.
   - `left_sum[2]` is 0.
   - `right_sum[1]` is 0.
   - `right_sum[2]` is 0.
   - `left_min[1]` is 0.
   - `left_min[2] is 0.
   - `left_max[cursor_pos]` is 0 if `op` is 'R' and `op_val` if `op` is not 'R'.
   - `op_val` is 1 if `op` is '(', -1 if `op` is ')' and 0 otherwise.
   - `context[cursor_pos]` is `op_val`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   right_sum[cursor_pos] = right_sum[cursor_pos + 1] + right_sum[cursor_pos]
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - If `cursor_pos` is 1:
     - `right_sum[1]` is initially 0.
     - `right_sum[1]` now becomes `right_sum[1 + 1] + right_sum[1]` which simplifies to `right_sum[2] + 0` which is `0`.
   - If `cursor_pos` is 3:
     - `right_sum[3]` is initially 0.
     - `right_sum[3]` now becomes `right_sum[3 + 1] + right_sum[3]` which simplifies to `right_sum[4] + 0` which is `0`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `right_sum[1]` remains 0.
- `right_sum[3]` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string with one less character; `ans_list` is `[-1]`; `operator_map` is `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with `right_max[1]` equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is either 1 or 3 depending on whether `op` is 'R' or not; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with `context[1]` equal to 0 (if `op` is 'R') or `context[1]` equal to 0 and `context[2]` equal to `op_val` (if `op` is not 'R'); `left_sum[1]` is 0; `left_sum[2]` is 0; `right_sum[1]` is 0; `right_sum[2]` is 0; `left_min[1]` is 0; `left_min[2]` is 0; `left_max[cursor_pos]` is 0 if `op` is 'R' and `op_val` if `op` is not 'R'; `op_val` is 1 if `op` is '(', -1 if `op` is ')' and 0 otherwise; `context[cursor_pos]` is `op_val`. `right_sum[3]` is 0.**
