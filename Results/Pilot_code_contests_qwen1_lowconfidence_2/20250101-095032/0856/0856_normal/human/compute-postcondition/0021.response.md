Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; if the operation `op` is 'R', `cursor_pos` is 2; otherwise, `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with either `context[1]` equal to `op_val` (when `op` is not 'R') or all elements equal to 0 (when `op` is 'R').***
