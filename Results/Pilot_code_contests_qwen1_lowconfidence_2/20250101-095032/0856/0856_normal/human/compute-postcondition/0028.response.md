The code updates the value of `right_max[cursor_pos]` to be the maximum of `right_max[cursor_pos + 1]` and `context[cursor_pos]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `cursor_pos` is set to 2 if `op` is 'R', otherwise it is 1.
- `context[1]` equals `op_val` if `op` is not 'R' and 0 if `op` is 'R'.
- `context[2]` equals 0 in both cases.
- `right_max[cursor_pos + 1]` is initially 0 because the index `cursor_pos + 1` refers to position 3.

Let's consider two scenarios based on the value of `op`:

1. If `op` is 'R':
   - `cursor_pos` is 1.
   - `context[1]` is 0.
   - `context[2]` is 0.
   - `right_max[cursor_pos + 1]` (which is `right_max[2]`) is 0.
   - So, `right_max[cursor_pos]` (which is `right_max[1]`) is updated to be `max(0, 0)`, which remains 0.

2. If `op` is not 'R':
   - `cursor_pos` is 2.
   - `context[1]` is 0.
   - `context[2]` is `op_val`.
   - `right_max[cursor_pos + 1]` (which is `right_max[3]`) is 0.
   - So, `right_max[cursor_pos]` (which is `right_max[2]`) is updated to be `max(0, op_val)`, which is `op_val`.

Therefore, the output state depends on whether `op` is 'R' or not:

- If `op` is 'R': `right_max[1]` is 0.
- If `op` is not 'R': `right_max[2]` is `op_val`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with `right_max[1]` equal to 0 and `right_max[2]` equal to `op_val` if `op` is not 'R' and 0 if `op` is 'R'; `cursor_pos` is 2 if `op` is 'R', otherwise `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with `context[1]` equal to 0 (if `op` is 'R') or `context[1]` equal to 0 and `context[2]` equal to `op_val` (if `op` is not 'R'); `left_sum[1]` is 0; `left_sum[2]` is 0; `right_sum[1]` is 0; `right_sum[2]` is 0; `left_min[1]` is 0; `left_min[2]` is 0; `left_max[cursor_pos]` is 0 if `op` is 'R' and `op_val` if `op` is not 'R'.**
