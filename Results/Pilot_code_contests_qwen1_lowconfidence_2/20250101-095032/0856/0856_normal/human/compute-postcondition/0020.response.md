The code `context[cursor_pos] = op_val` assigns the value of `op_val` to the position `cursor_pos` in the list `context`. Given the initial state, `cursor_pos` is 1, so this assignment changes the value of `context[1]` to `op_val`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive.
- `operations` is a non-empty string.
- `ans_list` is an empty list.
- `operator_map` is `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`.
- `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `cursor_pos` is 1.
- `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `op_val` is assigned the value from `operator_map` corresponding to `op`, or `0` if `op` is not found in `operator_map`.

After executing the line `context[cursor_pos] = op_val`, the value of `context[1]` is updated to `op_val`, while all other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with `context[1]` equal to `op_val` and all other elements equal to 0.**
