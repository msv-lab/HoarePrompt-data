The code `cursor_pos = max(1, cursor_pos - 1)` updates the value of `cursor_pos`. Given the initial state, `cursor_pos` is 3 if `op` is 'R' and 1 otherwise. Since `cursor_pos` is initially 3 (assuming `op` is 'R' based on the context), subtracting 1 from it gives 2, and then taking the maximum of 1 and 2 results in 2. Therefore, the new value of `cursor_pos` is 2.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`right_min[cursor_pos]` is `min(0, op_val)`, `left_min[1]` is 0 or `op_val`, `left_min[2]` is 0, `left_min[3]` is 0 or `op_val`, `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string with one less character, `ans_list` is `[-1, ans]`, `operator_map` is `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`, `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0, `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0, `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with `right_max[1]` equal to 0, `cursor_pos` is 2, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with `context[1]` equal to 0 (if `op` is 'R') or `context[1]` equal to 0 and `context[2]` equal to `op_val` (if `op` is not 'R'), `left_sum[1]` is 0, `left_sum[2]` is 0, `right_sum[1]` is 0, `right_sum[2]` is 0, `left_min[1]` is 0, `left_min[2]` is 0, `left_max[cursor_pos]` is 0 if `op` is 'R' and 1 if `op` is not 'R', `op_val` is 1 if `op` is '(', -1 if `op` is ')' and 0 otherwise, `context[cursor_pos]` is `op_val`, `right_sum[3]` is 0, `right_max[1]` is 1 if `context[1]` is 1 and 0 if `context[1]` is -1, `right_max[3]` is 1 if `context[3]` is 1 and 0 if `context[3]` is -1, `ans` is 1 if the condition `left_sum[cursor_pos] + right_sum[cursor_pos + 1] == 0 and left_min[cursor_pos] >= 0 and (right_min[cursor_pos] >= 0)` is true, otherwise `ans` remains -1.**
