The code updates `left_max[cursor_pos]` to be the maximum of `left_max[cursor_pos - 1]` and `context[cursor_pos]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `left_max[cursor_pos]` is 0 if `op` is 'R' and `op_val` if `op` is not 'R'.
- `context[cursor_pos]` is `op_val`.

Let's consider both cases for `op`:

1. If `op` is 'R':
   - `left_max[cursor_pos]` is initially 0.
   - `context[cursor_pos]` is 0.
   - `left_max[cursor_pos]` becomes `max(0, 0)`, which is 0.

2. If `op` is not 'R':
   - `left_max[cursor_pos]` is initially `op_val`, which is 1.
   - `context[cursor_pos]` is `op_val`, which is 1.
   - `left_max[cursor_pos]` becomes `max(1, 1)`, which is 1.

Therefore, the value of `left_max[cursor_pos]` remains the same as its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`right_min[cursor_pos]` is `min(0, op_val)`, `left_min[1]` is 0 or `op_val`, `left_min[2]` is 0, `left_min[3]` is 0 or `op_val`, `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive, `operations` is a non-empty string with one less character, `ans_list` is `[-1]`, `operator_map` is `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`, `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0, `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0, `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with `right_max[1]` equal to 0, `cursor_pos` is either 1 or 3 depending on whether `op` is 'R' or not, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with `context[1]` equal to 0 (if `op` is 'R') or `context[1]` equal to 0 and `context[2]` equal to `op_val` (if `op` is not 'R'), `left_sum[1]` is 0, `left_sum[2]` is 0, `right_sum[1]` is 0, `right_sum[2]` is 0, `left_min[1]` is 0, `left_min[2]` is 0, `left_max[cursor_pos]` is 0 if `op` is 'R' and 1 if `op` is not 'R', `op_val` is 1 if `op` is '(', -1 if `op` is ')' and 0 otherwise, `context[cursor_pos]` is `op_val`, `right_sum[3]` is 0.**
