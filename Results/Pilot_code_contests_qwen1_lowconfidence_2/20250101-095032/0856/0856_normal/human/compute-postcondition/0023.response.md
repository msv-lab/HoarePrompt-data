The code updates `left_sum[cursor_pos]` by adding the value of `context[cursor_pos]` to `left_sum[cursor_pos - 1]`. The value of `cursor_pos` depends on the operation `op`:
- If `op` is 'R', then `cursor_pos` is 2.
- Otherwise, `cursor_pos` is 1.

Given these conditions, let's consider both cases:

1. **If `op` is 'R':**
   - `cursor_pos` is 2.
   - `left_sum[cursor_pos]` is updated to `left_sum[cursor_pos - 1] + context[cursor_pos]`.
   - Since `cursor_pos` is 2, `left_sum[2]` is updated to `left_sum[1] + context[2]`.
   - The previous value of `left_sum[1]` is 0 (as per the initial state).
   - The previous value of `context[2]` is 0 (as per the initial state).

   Therefore, `left_sum[2]` becomes `0 + 0 = 0`.

2. **If `op` is not 'R':**
   - `cursor_pos` is 1.
   - `left_sum[cursor_pos]` is updated to `left_sum[cursor_pos - 1] + context[cursor_pos]`.
   - Since `cursor_pos` is 1, `left_sum[1]` is updated to `left_sum[0] + context[1]`.
   - The previous value of `left_sum[0]` is 0 (as per the initial state).
   - The previous value of `context[1]` is `op_val` (as per the initial state).

   Therefore, `left_sum[1]` becomes `0 + op_val = op_val`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is 2 if the operation `op` is 'R', otherwise `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with either `context[1]` equal to `op_val` (when `op` is not 'R') or all elements equal to 0 (when `op` is 'R'); `left_sum[1]` is `op_val` if `op` is not 'R' and 0 otherwise; `left_sum[2]` is 0.**
