Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. The initial state is defined as follows:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive.
   - `operations` is a non-empty string with one less character.
   - `ans_list` is `[-1]`.
   - `operator_map` is `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`.
   - `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
   - `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
   - `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with `right_max[1]` equal to 0.
   - `cursor_pos` is either 1 or 3 depending on whether `op` is 'R' or not.
   - `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with `context[1]` equal to 0 (if `op` is 'R') or `context[1]` equal to 0 and `context[2]` equal to `op_val` (if `op` is not 'R').
   - `left_sum[1]` is 0.
   - `left_sum[2]` is 0.
   - `right_sum[1]` is 0.
   - `right_sum[2]` is 0.
   - `left_min[1]` is 0.
   - `left_min[2]` is 0.
   - `left_max[cursor_pos]` is 0 if `op` is 'R' and `op_val` if `op` is not 'R'.
   - `op_val` is 1 if `op` is '(', -1 if `op` is ')' and 0 otherwise.
   - `context[cursor_pos]` is `op_val`.

2. The code snippet updates `left_sum[cursor_pos]` as follows:
   ```python
   left_sum[cursor_pos] = left_sum[cursor_pos - 1] + context[cursor_pos]
   ```

3. Since `cursor_pos` is either 1 or 3:
   - If `cursor_pos` is 1:
     - `left_sum[1]` was initially 0.
     - `left_sum[1]` now becomes `left_sum[1 - 1] + context[1]` which simplifies to `0 + context[1]`.
     - Since `context[1]` is 0 (because `op` is 'R'), `left_sum[1]` remains 0.
   - If `cursor_pos` is 3:
     - `left_sum[3]` was initially 0.
     - `left_sum[3]` now becomes `left_sum[3 - 1] + context[3]` which simplifies to `0 + context[3]`.
     - Since `context[3]` is `op_val` (which can be 1 if `op` is '(', -1 if `op` is ')', or 0 otherwise), `left_sum[3]` is updated to `op_val`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `left_sum[1]` remains 0.
- `left_sum[3]` is updated to `op_val`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string with one less character; `ans_list` is `[-1]`; `operator_map` is `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with `left_sum[1]` equal to 0 and `left_sum[3]` equal to `op_val`; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with `right_max[1]` equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is either 1 or 3 depending on whether `op` is 'R' or not; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with `context[1]` equal to 0 (if `op` is 'R') or `context[1]` equal to 0 and `context[2]` equal to `op_val` (if `op` is not 'R'); `right_sum[1]` is 0; `right_sum[2]` is 0; `left_min[1]` is 0; `left_min[2]` is 0; `left_max[cursor_pos]` is 0 if `op` is 'R' and `op_val` if `op` is not 'R'. `op_val` is 1 if `op` is '(', -1 if `op` is ')' and 0 otherwise. `context[cursor_pos]` is `op_val`.
