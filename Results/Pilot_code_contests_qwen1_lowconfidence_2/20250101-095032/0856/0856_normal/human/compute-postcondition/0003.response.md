The code creates a dictionary called `operator_map` that maps parentheses to integers (`'('` to 1 and `')'` to -1). This does not affect the values of `n`, `operations`, or `ans_list`. Therefore, the only change is in the introduction of the new variable `operator_map`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive; `operations` is the input string provided by the user; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}**
