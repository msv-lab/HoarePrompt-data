The code updates the value of `right_sum[cursor_pos]` by adding `right_sum[cursor_pos + 1]` to `right_sum[cursor_pos]`. Let's consider the different cases for `cursor_pos`:

1. If `cursor_pos` is 2 (as in the given example):
   - `right_sum[2]` is updated to `right_sum[2] + right_sum[3]`.
   - Given that `right_sum[3]` is 0, the new value of `right_sum[2]` remains unchanged, which is 0.

2. If `cursor_pos` is 4 (as in the given example):
   - `right_sum[4]` is updated to `right_sum[4] + right_sum[5]`.
   - Since `right_sum[5]` does not exist in the context (it is out of bounds), this part of the code does not affect `right_sum[4]` and it remains unchanged, which is 0.

Given the above analysis, the only variable that changes is `right_sum[cursor_pos]`, and its new value depends on the value of `right_sum[cursor_pos + 1]`.

Output State: **`right_sum[2]` is 0, `right_sum[4]` is 0**
