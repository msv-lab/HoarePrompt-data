The code initializes `right_max` as a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0. This means that `right_max` is set to a list of zeros with `n + 2` elements. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive; `operations` is the input string provided by the user; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.**
