The code updates the `left_min[cursor_pos]` variable to be the minimum value between `left_min[cursor_pos - 1]` and `context[cursor_pos]`. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `cursor_pos` is 2 if the operation `op` is 'R', otherwise `cursor_pos` is 1.
- `context[1]` is `op_val` when `op` is not 'R' and all elements of `context` are 0 when `op` is 'R'.
- `left_min[cursor_pos - 1]` will be 0 since `cursor_pos - 1` is 1 and `left_min[1]` is initialized to 0.

Let's consider both cases for `cursor_pos`:

1. **If `op` is 'R':**
   - `cursor_pos` is 1.
   - `context[1]` is 0 (since `op` is 'R').
   - `left_min[cursor_pos] = left_min[0] = 0` (since `left_min[0]` is not defined but `left_min[1]` is 0).

2. **If `op` is not 'R':**
   - `cursor_pos` is 2.
   - `context[1]` is `op_val`.
   - `left_min[cursor_pos] = min(left_min[1], context[2]) = min(0, 0) = 0`.

In both cases, `left_min[cursor_pos]` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is 2 if the operation `op` is 'R', otherwise `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with either `context[1]` equal to `op_val` (when `op` is not 'R') or all elements equal to 0 (when `op` is 'R'); `left_sum[1]` is `op_val` if `op` is not 'R' and 0 otherwise; `left_sum[2]` is 0; `right_sum[1]` is 0; `right_sum[2]` is 0; `left_min[1]` is 0; `left_min[2]` is 0.**
