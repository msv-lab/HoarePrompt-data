The code updates the value of `right_min[cursor_pos]` to the minimum of `right_min[cursor_pos + 1]` and `context[cursor_pos]`. Given the initial state:

- `right_min[cursor_pos + 1]` is 0.
- `context[cursor_pos]` is `op_val`.

Since `op_val` is either 1, -1, or 0, and `right_min[cursor_pos + 1]` is 0, the minimum value will be `min(0, op_val)`.

Therefore, `right_min[cursor_pos]` will be updated to `min(0, op_val)`.

The output state is:
**`right_min[cursor_pos]` is `min(0, op_val)`, `left_min[1]` is 0 or `op_val`, `left_min[2]` is 0, `left_min[3]` is 0 or `op_val`, `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive, `operations` is a non-empty string with one less character, `ans_list` is `[-1]`, `operator_map` is `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`, `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0, `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0, `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with `right_max[1]` equal to 0, `cursor_pos` is either 1 or 3 depending on whether `op` is 'R' or not, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with `context[1]` equal to 0 (if `op` is 'R') or `context[1]` equal to 0 and `context[2]` equal to `op_val` (if `op` is not 'R'), `left_sum[1]` is 0, `left_sum[2]` is 0, `right_sum[1]` is 0, `right_sum[2]` is 0, `left_min[1]` is 0, `left_min[2]` is 0, `left_max[cursor_pos]` is 0 if `op` is 'R' and `op_val` if `op` is not 'R', `op_val` is 1 if `op` is '(', -1 if `op` is ')' and 0 otherwise, `context[cursor_pos]` is `op_val`, `right_sum[3]` is 0.**
