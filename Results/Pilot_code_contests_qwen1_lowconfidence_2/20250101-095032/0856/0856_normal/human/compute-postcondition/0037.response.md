The code assigns `op_val` the value of `operator_map.get(op, 0)`. Since `operator_map` is defined as `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`, `op_val` will be `1` if `op` is '(', `-1` if `op` is ')', and `0` otherwise. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string with one less character; `ans_list` is `[-1]`; `operator_map` is `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with `right_max[1]` equal to 0 and `right_max[2]` equal to `op_val` if `op` is not 'R' and 0 if `op` is 'R'; `cursor_pos` is 2 if `op` is 'R', otherwise `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with `context[1]` equal to 0 (if `op` is 'R') or `context[1]` equal to 0 and `context[2]` equal to `op_val` (if `op` is not 'R'); `left_sum[1]` is 0; `left_sum[2]` is 0; `right_sum[1]` is 0; `right_sum[2]` is 0; `left_min[1]` is 0; `left_min[2] is 0; `left_max[cursor_pos]` is 0 if `op` is 'R' and `op_val` if `op` is not 'R'; `op_val` is 1 if `op` is '(', -1 if `op` is ')', and 0 otherwise.**
