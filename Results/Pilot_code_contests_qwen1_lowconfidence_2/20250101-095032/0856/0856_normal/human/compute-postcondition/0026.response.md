The code updates `right_min[cursor_pos]` to be the minimum value between `right_min[cursor_pos + 1]` and `context[cursor_pos]`. Given the initial state, `cursor_pos` is either 1 or 2 depending on the operation `op`. We need to consider both cases:

1. If `op` is 'R', then `cursor_pos` is 1, and the initial values are:
   - `right_min[1]` is 0
   - `right_min[2]` is 0
   - `context[1]` is 0
   - `context[2]` is 0

   So, `right_min[1]` remains unchanged because `right_min[2]` (which is 0) is the same as `context[1]` (which is also 0). Thus, `right_min[1]` is still 0.

2. If `op` is not 'R', then `cursor_pos` is 2, and the initial values are:
   - `right_min[1]` is 0
   - `right_min[2]` is 0
   - `context[1]` is 0
   - `context[2]` is `op_val`

   So, `right_min[2]` remains unchanged because `right_min[1]` (which is 0) is the same as `context[2]` (which is `op_val`). Thus, `right_min[2]` is still 0.

Therefore, the updated values after the code execution are:
- `right_min[1]` is 0
- `right_min[2]` is 0

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is 2 if the operation `op` is 'R', otherwise `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with either `context[1]` equal to `op_val` (when `op` is not 'R') or all elements equal to 0 (when `op` is 'R'); `left_sum[1]` is `op_val` if `op` is not 'R' and 0 otherwise; `left_sum[2]` is 0; `right_sum[1]` is 0; `right_sum[2]` is 0; `left_min[1]` is 0; `left_min[2]` is 0.**
