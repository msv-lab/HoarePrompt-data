Let's analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration and determine how the state needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive.
- `operations` is a non-empty string.
- `ans_list` is `[-1]`.
- `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}.
- `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with `right_max[1]` equal to 0 and `right_max[2]` equal to `op_val` if `op` is not 'R' and 0 if `op` is 'R'.
- `cursor_pos` is 2 if `op` is 'R', otherwise `cursor_pos` is 1.
- `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with `context[1]` equal to 0 (if `op` is 'R') or `context[1]` equal to 0 and `context[2]` equal to `op_val` (if `op` is not 'R').
- `left_sum[1]` is 0.
- `left_sum[2]` is 0.
- `right_sum[1]` is 0.
- `right_sum[2]` is 0.
- `left_min[1]` is 0.
- `left_min[2]` is 0.
- `left_max[cursor_pos]` is 0 if `op` is 'R' and `op_val` if `op` is not 'R'.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the `operations` string. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as there are more characters in the `operations` string to process.

2. **Adjusting the States**:
   - **`operations`**: At the end of the previous iteration, we have processed one character from the `operations` string. Therefore, `operations` now contains all characters except the last one processed.
   - **`ans_list`**: Remains unchanged since the `ans_list` is only updated within the loop and is initialized as `[-1]` before the loop starts.
   - **`operator_map`**: Remains unchanged since it is a static dictionary.
   - **`left_sum`**: Remains unchanged since the `left_sum` is updated based on the current operation, but not outside the loop.
   - **`right_min`**: Remains unchanged since the `right_min` is updated based on the current operation, but not outside the loop.
   - **`right_max`**: Remains unchanged since the `right_max` is updated based on the current operation, but not outside the loop.
   - **`cursor_pos`**: If the last operation was 'R', `cursor_pos` remains 2. Otherwise, it will be 1 for the next operation.
   - **`context`**: If the last operation was 'R', `context` remains `[0, 0]`. Otherwise, it will be `[0, op_val]` for the next operation.
   - **`left_sum[1]`**: Remains 0 since `left_sum[1]` is only updated within the loop.
   - **`left_sum[2]`**: Remains 0 since `left_sum[2]` is only updated within the loop.
   - **`right_sum[1]`**: Remains 0 since `right_sum[1]` is only updated within the loop.
   - **`right_sum[2]`**: Remains 0 since `right_sum[2]` is only updated within the loop.
   - **`left_min[1]`**: Remains 0 since `left_min[1]` is only updated within the loop.
   - **`left_min[2]`**: Remains 0 since `left_min[2]` is only updated within the loop.
   - **`left_max[cursor_pos]`**: If the last operation was 'R', `left_max[2]` remains 0. Otherwise, it will be `op_val` for the next operation.

### Final State for the Next Iteration:
- `operations` is a string with one less character than before.
- `cursor_pos` is 2 if the last operation was 'R', otherwise it is 1.
- `context` is `[0, 0]` if the last operation was 'R', otherwise it is `[0, op_val]`.
