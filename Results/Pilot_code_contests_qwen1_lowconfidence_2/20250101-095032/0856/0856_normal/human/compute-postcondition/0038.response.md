The code updates the `context[cursor_pos]` variable with the value of `op_val`. Given the conditions provided, `op_val` is determined by the operation `op`:
- If `op` is '(', `op_val` is 1.
- If `op` is ')', `op_val` is -1.
- Otherwise, `op_val` is 0.

The cursor position (`cursor_pos`) determines which index in the `context` list is updated:
- If `op` is 'R', `cursor_pos` is 2, and `context[2]` is set to `op_val`.
- Otherwise, `cursor_pos` is 1, and `context[1]` is set to `op_val`.

Therefore, depending on the value of `op`, the `context` list will be updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string with one less character; `ans_list` is `[-1]`; `operator_map` is `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with `right_max[1]` equal to 0 and `right_max[2]` equal to `op_val` if `op` is not 'R' and 0 if `op` is 'R'; `cursor_pos` is 2 if `op` is 'R', otherwise `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with `context[1]` equal to 0 (if `op` is 'R') or `context[1]` equal to 0 and `context[2]` equal to `op_val` (if `op` is not 'R'); `left_sum[1]` is 0; `left_sum[2]` is 0; `right_sum[1]` is 0; `right_sum[2]` is 0; `left_min[1]` is 0; `left_min[2] is 0; `left_max[cursor_pos]` is 0 if `op` is 'R' and `op_val` if `op` is not 'R'; `op_val` is 1 if `op` is '(', -1 if `op` is ')', and 0 otherwise; `context[cursor_pos]` is `op_val`.**
