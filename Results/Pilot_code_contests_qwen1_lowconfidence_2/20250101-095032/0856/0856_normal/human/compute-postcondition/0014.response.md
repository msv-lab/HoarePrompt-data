The `cursor_pos` variable is decremented by 1. Since `cursor_pos` starts at 1, decrementing it results in `cursor_pos` being 0. However, the `max` function ensures that `cursor_pos` does not go below 1. Therefore, `cursor_pos` remains at 1.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` must be a non-empty string; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; the current operation is 'L'**
