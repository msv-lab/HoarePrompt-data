The code `cursor_pos += 1` increments the value of `cursor_pos` by 1. Given the initial state, `cursor_pos` is 2 if `op` is 'R', otherwise `cursor_pos` is 1. After incrementing, the new value of `cursor_pos` will be 3 if `op` is 'R', or 2 if `op` is not 'R'. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string with one less character; `ans_list` is `[-1]`; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with `right_max[1]` equal to 0 and `right_max[2]` equal to `op_val` if `op` is not 'R' and 0 if `op` is 'R'; `cursor_pos` is 3 if `op` is 'R' and 2 if `op` is not 'R'; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with `context[1]` equal to 0 (if `op` is 'R') or `context[1]` equal to 0 and `context[2]` equal to `op_val` (if `op` is not 'R'); `left_sum[1]` is 0; `left_sum[2]` is 0; `right_sum[1]` is 0; `right_sum[2]` is 0; `left_min[1]` is 0; `left_min[2] is 0; `left_max[cursor_pos]` is 0 if `op` is 'R' and `op_val` if `op` is not 'R'.**
