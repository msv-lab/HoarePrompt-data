The code snippet appends the value of `ans` to `ans_list`. The value of `ans` is determined based on certain conditions involving `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, and `right_min`. However, since the actual value of `ans` is not specified in the initial state, we will keep it as `-1` unless there is a condition that sets it to a different value. Given the initial state, no conditions are met to set `ans` to a specific value, so `ans` remains `-1`.

After executing `ans_list.append(ans)`, the value of `ans` is appended to `ans_list`. Since `ans` is initially `-1`, `ans_list` becomes `[-1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string; `ans_list` is `[-1]`; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with `right_max[1]` equal to 0 and `right_max[2]` equal to `op_val` if `op` is not 'R' and 0 if `op` is 'R'; `cursor_pos` is 2 if `op` is 'R', otherwise `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with `context[1]` equal to 0 (if `op` is 'R') or `context[1]` equal to 0 and `context[2]` equal to `op_val` (if `op` is not 'R'); `left_sum[1]` is 0; `left_sum[2]` is 0; `right_sum[1]` is 0; `right_sum[2]` is 0; `left_min[1]` is 0; `left_min[2]` is 0; `left_max[cursor_pos]` is 0 if `op` is 'R' and `op_val` if `op` is not 'R'.**
