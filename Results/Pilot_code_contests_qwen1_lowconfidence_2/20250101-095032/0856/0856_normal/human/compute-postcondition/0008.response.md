The code initializes `left_max` as a list of length `n + 2` with each element set to 0. This means that `left_max` is now a list where each element from index 0 to `n + 1` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive; `operations` is the input string provided by the user; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `left_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.**
