The code initializes the variable `cursor_pos` to 1. The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive. The lists `ans_list`, `left_sum`, `right_min`, and `right_max` remain as they were, and no operations or inputs are processed yet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is the input string provided by the user; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is 1.**
