The code `op_val = operator_map.get(op, 0)` retrieves the value associated with the key `op` from the dictionary `operator_map`. If `op` is not found in `operator_map`, the default value `0` is assigned to `op_val`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive.
- `operations` is a non-empty string.
- `ans_list` is an empty list.
- `operator_map` is `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`.
- `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `cursor_pos` is 1.
- `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- The operation `op` is not 'R'.

The variable `op_val` is assigned the value from `operator_map` corresponding to `op`, or `0` if `op` is not found in `operator_map`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive.
- `operations` is a non-empty string.
- `ans_list` is an empty list.
- `operator_map` is `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`.
- `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `cursor_pos` is 1.
- `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.
- `op_val` is assigned the value from `operator_map` corresponding to `op`, or `0` if `op` is not found in `operator_map`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is `{'(': 1, ')': -1}`; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `op_val` is assigned the value from `operator_map` corresponding to `op`, or `0` if `op` is not found in `operator_map`.**
