The code initializes `right_sum` as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 2`. This means that `right_sum` is now a list where each element is 0, and the list has a total of `n + 2` elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive; `operations` is the input string provided by the user; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0**
