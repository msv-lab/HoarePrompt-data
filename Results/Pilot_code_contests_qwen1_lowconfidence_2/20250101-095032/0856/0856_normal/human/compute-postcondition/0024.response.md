The code updates the `right_sum` list at the index `cursor_pos` by setting it to the sum of its current value and the value at the next index (`cursor_pos + 1`). The initial state of `right_sum` is such that all elements are 0 except for `right_sum[1]` which is undefined because it's not initialized in the provided information. However, `right_sum[cursor_pos]` is initially 0 since all elements are 0.

Let's consider two cases based on the value of `cursor_pos`:

1. If `cursor_pos` is 1 (which means `op` is 'R'):
   - Initially, `right_sum[1]` is 0.
   - Setting `right_sum[cursor_pos]` would mean updating `right_sum[1]`.
   - So, `right_sum[1]` becomes `right_sum[1] + right_sum[2]`.
   - Since `right_sum[2]` is 0, `right_sum[1]` remains 0.

2. If `cursor_pos` is 2 (which means `op` is not 'R'):
   - Initially, `right_sum[2]` is 0.
   - Setting `right_sum[cursor_pos]` would mean updating `right_sum[2]`.
   - So, `right_sum[2]` becomes `right_sum[2] + right_sum[3]`.
   - Since `right_sum[3]` is 0, `right_sum[2]` remains 0.

In both cases, the value of `right_sum[cursor_pos]` remains 0. Therefore, the updated state of `right_sum` is that all elements remain 0, and `right_sum[cursor_pos]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is a non-empty string; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is 2 if the operation `op` is 'R', otherwise `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with either `context[1]` equal to `op_val` (when `op` is not 'R') or all elements equal to 0 (when `op` is 'R'); `left_sum[1]` is `op_val` if `op` is not 'R' and 0 otherwise; `left_sum[2]` is 0; `right_sum[1]` is 0; `right_sum[2]` is 0.**
