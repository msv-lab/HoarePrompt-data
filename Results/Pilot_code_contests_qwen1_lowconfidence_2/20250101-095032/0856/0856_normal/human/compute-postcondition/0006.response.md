The code initializes `left_min` as a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0. This overwrites the initial state of `left_sum`, which was also a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0. However, since `left_min` is initialized to this same value, the values of `left_sum` remain unchanged.

The values of `n`, `operations`, `ans_list`, `operator_map`, and `right_sum` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive; `operations` is the input string provided by the user; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `left_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.**
