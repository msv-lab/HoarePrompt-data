The code initializes a list called `context` with `n + 2` elements, each set to 0. This means that the list `context` is now filled with zeros up to the length of `n + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\), inclusive; `operations` is the input string provided by the user; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element equal to 0.**
