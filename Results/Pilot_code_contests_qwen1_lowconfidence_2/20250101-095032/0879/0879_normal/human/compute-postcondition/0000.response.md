The code `n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. Since the initial state defines `n` and `m` as positive integers between 1 and \(10^5\), the new values of `n` and `m` will be the integers entered as input, but they will still adhere to the range constraints.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `m` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\)`**
