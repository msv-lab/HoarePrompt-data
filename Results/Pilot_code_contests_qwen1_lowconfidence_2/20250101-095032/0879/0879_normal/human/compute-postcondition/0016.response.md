Postcondition: **`a` contains at least one element, `i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order. If `i` equals `m - 1`, then `min_r` is the maximum of its current value and the minimum of `abs(el - b[m - 1])` and `abs(el - b[m - 2])`. Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el`, `b[i+1]`, `b[i-1]`, and `b[i]`.**
