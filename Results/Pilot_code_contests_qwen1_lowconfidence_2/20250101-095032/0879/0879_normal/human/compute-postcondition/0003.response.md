The code `min_r = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `min_r`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or the contents of the iterator `b`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `min_r` with the value 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `m` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `b` is an iterator of integers obtained from the split and mapped input; `min_r` is 0**
