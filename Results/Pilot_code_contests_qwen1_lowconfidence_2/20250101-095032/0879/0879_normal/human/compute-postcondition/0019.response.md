To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. The variable `a` must still contain at least one element since it is the source of the `el` values.
2. The variable `i` will be updated based on the current element `el`.
3. The variable `min_r` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and the smallest difference between `el` and its neighboring elements in `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `a` must contain at least one element.
- `i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order.
- `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the smallest difference between `el` and its neighboring elements in `b`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- `a` should still contain at least one element.
- `i` will be the index where the next `el` (the first remaining element in `a`) would be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order.
- `min_r` will be updated to include the smallest difference between the next `el` and its neighboring elements in `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`a` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the index where the next `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the smallest difference between the next `el` and its neighboring elements in `b`.**
