Postcondition: ***`a` must contain at least two elements; `i` is the index where the next `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order; `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the minimum of `abs(el - b[i + 1])`, `abs(el - b[i - 1])`, and `abs(el - b[i])`.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts, ensuring that `min_r` is updated appropriately based on whether `i` equals `m - 1` or not.
