Postcondition: ***`a` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order, and `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the smallest difference between `el` and its neighboring elements in `b`. Specifically, if `i` is 0, then `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the absolute difference between `el` and `b[0]`. Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the smallest difference between `el` and its neighboring elements in `b`.***
