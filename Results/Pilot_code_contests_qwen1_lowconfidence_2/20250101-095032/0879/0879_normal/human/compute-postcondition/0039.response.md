The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\). Additionally, the function takes two lists: `a` and `b`. List `a` contains `n` non-decreasing integers representing the x-coordinates of cities, and list `b` contains `m` non-decreasing integers representing the x-coordinates of cellular towers.

The output of the function is not specified directly in the problem statement, but based on the given constraints and the typical nature of such problems, it is likely that the function returns an integer or a list indicating the number of cities or a specific relationship between the cities and the cellular towers. However, since no specific output is provided, we will only describe the parameters accepted by the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `m`, both positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\), and two lists `a` and `b` where `a` contains `n` non-decreasing integers and `b` contains `m` non-decreasing integers.**
