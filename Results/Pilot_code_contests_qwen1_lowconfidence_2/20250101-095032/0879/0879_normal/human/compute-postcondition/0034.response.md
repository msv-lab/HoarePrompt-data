Postcondition: **`a` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the minimum of `abs(el - b[m - 1])`, `abs(el - b[m - 2])`, `abs(el - b[i + 1])`, `abs(el - b[i - 1])`, and `abs(el - b[i])`.**
