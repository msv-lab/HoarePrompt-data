Postcondition: ***`a` must contain at least two elements; `i` is the index where the next `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order; `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the smallest difference between the next `el` and its neighboring elements in `b`. Specifically, if `i` is 0, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the smallest difference between the next `el` and its neighboring elements in `b`, now specifically `max(min_r, abs(el_initial - b0_initial))`. Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and `b[i + 1]`, `b[i - 1]`, and `b[i]` if `i` equals `m`, otherwise the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and `b[i + 1]`, `b[i - 1]`, and `b[i]`***.
