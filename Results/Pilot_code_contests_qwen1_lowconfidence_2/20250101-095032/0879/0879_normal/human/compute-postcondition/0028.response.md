Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `a` must contain at least two elements.
   - `i` is the index where the next `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order.
   - `min_r` is updated based on the conditions provided.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `el` in `a`.

3. **Updating States**:
   - For each new iteration, `el` is the next element from `a`.
   - The variable `i` is updated based on the position where `el` would be inserted into `b` to keep it sorted.
   - `min_r` is updated based on the specific conditions given:
     - If `i` is 0, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the smallest difference between `el` and the first element of `b` (`b[0]`).
     - If `i` is `m` (the length of `b`), `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the smallest difference between `el` and the last element of `b` (`b[m-1]`).
     - Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and `b[i + 1]`, `b[i - 1]`, and `b[i]`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- Since `a` must contain at least two elements and we are moving to the next element, `a` still contains at least two elements.
- `i` is updated to the next index where the next `el` would be inserted to maintain sorted order.
- `min_r` is updated based on the current value and the new element `el`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element from `a`, the updated `i`, and the updated `min_r`.

State: **`a` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the index where the next `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the smallest difference between the next `el` and its neighboring elements in `b`.**
