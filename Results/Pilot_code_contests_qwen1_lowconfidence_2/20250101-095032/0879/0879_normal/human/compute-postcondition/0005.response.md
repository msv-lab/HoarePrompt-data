The `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module returns the index where the element `el` would be inserted in the list `b` to maintain sorted order. However, since the initial state only mentions that `a` must contain at least one element, and there's no reference to `b` or `el`, we can infer that `a` might be confused with `b` and `el` is an element we are searching for in `b`. 

Given the initial state and the code snippet:

- `a` contains at least one element.
- The code `i = bisect_left(b, el)` implies that `b` is the list being searched and `el` is the element being searched for.

Since the exact elements in `b` and the value of `el` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact index `i`. However, we know that `i` will be the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to keep the list sorted.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order.**
