The code `a = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer, and returns an iterator over the resulting integers. However, since no specific input is provided, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in the iterator `a`. We can only say that `a` is now an iterator containing integers read from the input, while `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `m` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `a` is an iterator of integers obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace and converting the parts to integers**
