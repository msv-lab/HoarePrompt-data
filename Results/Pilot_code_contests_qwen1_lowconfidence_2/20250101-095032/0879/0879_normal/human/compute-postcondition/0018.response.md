Postcondition: ***`a` must contain at least one element, `i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order. `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the smallest difference between `el` and its neighboring elements in `b`, considering all possible positions of insertion (including boundaries).***
