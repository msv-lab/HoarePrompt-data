Postcondition: ***`a` must contain at least two elements; `i` is the index where the next `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order; `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the smallest difference between the next `el` and its neighboring elements in `b`. Specifically, if `i` equals `m`, then `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the absolute difference between `el` and `b[m - 1]`. Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and `b[i + 1]`, `b[i - 1]`, and `b[i]`.***
