The code `b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on whitespace, and then maps each element to an integer using the `map` function. This means that `b` is now an iterator of integers derived from the input.

The original values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. The variable `a` is no longer relevant after this line of code, since it was defined in a different context before this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `m` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `b` is an iterator of integers obtained from the split and mapped input.**
