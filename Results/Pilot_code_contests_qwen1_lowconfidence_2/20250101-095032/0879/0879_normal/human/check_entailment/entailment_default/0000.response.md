Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the minimal \( r \) such that each city is covered by at least one cellular tower. The code uses binary search via `bisect_left` to find the closest tower for each city, but it fails to handle the case where a city is exactly at the midpoint between two towers, which would require a radius of at least the distance to the next closest tower.

For instance, consider the following example:

Input:
```
4 3
-1 0 1 2
-2 0 2
```

Expected output: \( r = 2 \)

However, the current implementation would calculate the minimum radius based on the closest tower for each city, potentially missing the correct value. For example, the city at position 0 would check the closest tower at position -2 and 2, and the code would incorrectly set \( r \) to 2 instead of considering the full range required to cover all cities.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the minimum radius is determined by the maximum distance from any city to its nearest tower, including handling edge cases where a city is at the boundary between two towers.
