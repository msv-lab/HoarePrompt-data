The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers and a string `sep`. It joins the elements of `l` using `sep` and prints the result. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation or the code itself, so we can assume the function handles typical input scenarios properly. However, it is worth noting that the list `l` should contain only integers, and `sep` should be a string. If `l` contains non-integer values, a `TypeError` would occur, which is not handled within the function. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the joined string.
