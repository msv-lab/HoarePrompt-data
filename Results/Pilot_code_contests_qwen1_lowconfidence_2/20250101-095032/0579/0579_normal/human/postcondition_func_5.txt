The function takes no explicit parameters and performs a series of operations internally. It first calls `func_2()` three times to get the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`. It then creates two `Counter` objects, `cntA` and `cntB`, to count the occurrences of elements in lists `a` and `b`, respectively. The function iterates over the lists `a` and `b` and calculates the value of `ans` based on the formula `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` for each element. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` divided by 2. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the lists `a` and `b` contain duplicate elements, and the overall sum of `a`, `b`, and `k` does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). However, the provided code does not handle these edge cases explicitly, and the overall functionality is to compute and print a specific value derived from the given inputs.
