#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, a and b are integers representing the number of boys and girls in the class respectively, k is an integer representing the number of couples ready to dance together, a list of k integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k is provided where each a_i is an integer between 1 and a inclusive, and a list of k integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_k is provided where each b_i is an integer between 1 and b inclusive.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly (since the annotated code snippet only shows the return statement without parameter definitions). It reads an integer input from the user and returns it. There are no actions performed on the input values `a`, `b`, `k`, `a_list`, or `b_list` as described in the annotations, which are likely incorrect or misleading. The function simply takes an integer input from the user and returns it without any further processing or use of the provided parameters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The lists a_1, a_2, ..., a_k and b_1, b_2, ..., b_k are lists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of three integers obtained from user input, split and converted to integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three space-separated integers, and converts them to a list of integers. The function then returns this list. This process assumes the user inputs exactly three integers separated by spaces. If the input does not conform to this expectation (e.g., fewer than three integers, non-integer values, or values not separated by spaces), the function will not behave as intended and may result in incorrect behavior or errors.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, a, b, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The lists of integers a_1, a_2, …, a_k and b_1, b_2, …, b_k contain unique values within their respective ranges (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a) and (1 ≤ b_i ≤ b).
def func_3():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of input values for a_1, a_2, …, a_k and b_1, b_2, …, b_k
#Overall this is what the function does:- The function should explicitly define how the values for \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) are determined based on the predefined values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(k\). This could involve generating these values, retrieving them from a predefined list, or any other method specified by the problem context.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, a and b are integers representing the number of boys and girls respectively, k is an integer representing the number of couples ready to dance together, and the following two lines contain k integers each, representing the boy and girl numbers in the couples respectively.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns a string containing input from the user, which represents the input for the test case
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` does not accept any parameters and simply reads input from the user. This input is a string that contains multiple pieces of information separated by spaces, including the number of test cases, the number of boys and girls for each test case, the number of couples, and the specific boy and girl numbers in the couples. After executing, the function returns this string. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation, and the code itself only reads input without performing any additional actions or validations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing the number of valid pairings for each test case, and sep is a string used to join the elements of l before printing.
def func_5(l, sep):
    print(sep.join(l))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers and a string `sep`. It joins the elements of `l` using `sep` and prints the result. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation or the code itself, so we can assume the function handles typical input scenarios properly. However, it is worth noting that the list `l` should contain only integers, and `sep` should be a string. If `l` contains non-integer values, a `TypeError` would occur, which is not handled within the function. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the joined string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, a, b, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the lists a and b are of length k containing integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b respectively; the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; each pair (a_i, b_i) is unique within each test case.
def func_6():
    n, m, k = func_2()
    a = func_2()
    b = func_2()
    cntA = Counter(a)
    cntB = Counter(b)
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(k):
        ans += k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `m` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `k` is the same as before, `b` is the result of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `a`, `cntB` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `b`, `ans` is \(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (k - \text{cntA}[a[i]] - \text{cntB}[b[i]] + 1)\)
    print(ans / 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no explicit parameters and performs a series of operations internally. It first calls `func_2()` three times to get the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`. It then creates two `Counter` objects, `cntA` and `cntB`, to count the occurrences of elements in lists `a` and `b`, respectively. The function iterates over the lists `a` and `b` and calculates the value of `ans` based on the formula `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` for each element. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` divided by 2. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the lists `a` and `b` contain duplicate elements, and the overall sum of `a`, `b`, and `k` does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). However, the provided code does not handle these edge cases explicitly, and the overall functionality is to compute and print a specific value derived from the given inputs.
