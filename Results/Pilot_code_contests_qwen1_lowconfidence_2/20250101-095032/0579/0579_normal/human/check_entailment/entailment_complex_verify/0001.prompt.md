You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: At the school where Vasya is studying, preparations are underway for the graduation ceremony. One of the planned performances is a ball, which will be attended by pairs of boys and girls.

Each class must present two couples to the ball. In Vasya's class, a boys and b girls wish to participate. But not all boys and not all girls are ready to dance in pairs.

Formally, you know k possible one-boy-one-girl pairs. You need to choose two of these pairs so that no person is in more than one pair.

For example, if a=3, b=4, k=4 and the couples (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4) are ready to dance together (in each pair, the boy's number comes first, then the girl's number), then the following combinations of two pairs are possible (not all possible options are listed below): 

  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (3, 4) and (1, 3); 



But the following combinations are not possible: 

  * (1, 3) and (1, 2) — the first boy enters two pairs; 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 2) — the second girl enters two pairs; 



Find the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition above. Two ways are considered different if they consist of different pairs.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers a, b and k (1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of boys and girls in the class and the number of couples ready to dance together.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_1, a_2, … a_k. (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a), where a_i is the number of the boy in the pair with the number i.

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_1, b_2, … b_k. (1 ≤ b_i ≤ b), where b_i is the number of the girl in the pair with the number i.

It is guaranteed that the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

It is guaranteed that each pair is specified at most once in one test case.

Output

For each test case, on a separate line print one integer — the number of ways to choose two pairs that match the condition above.

Example

Note

In the first test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 2) and (3, 4); 
  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 3) and (3, 4); 
  * (2, 2) and (3, 4). 



There is only one pair in the second test case.

In the third test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 1) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 1).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the same person is not included in more than one pair. 

Consider the following test case:
- `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `k = 4`
- Pairs: `(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4)`

According to the problem description, the valid pairs are:
- `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`
- `(1, 3)` and `(2, 2)`
- `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`
- `(1, 3)` and `(3, 4)`

However, the program counts:
- `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`
- `(1, 3)` and `(2, 2)`
- `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`
- `(1, 3)` and `(3, 4)`

The program incorrectly counts the pair `(1, 3)` and `(3, 4)` twice because it does not properly account for the constraint that no person can be in more than one pair. This can be seen in the calculation where it simply subtracts the counts of the current pair from the total number of pairs without ensuring that the pairs are distinct.

To fix this, the program needs to maintain a set of used boys and girls and ensure that no boy or girl is added to more than one pair.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys
from collections import defaultdict as ddict, Counter

testing = len(sys.argv) == 4 and sys.argv[3] == 'myTest'
if testing:
    cmd = sys.stdout
    from time import time
    start_time = int(round(time() * 1000))
    input = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').readline
    readAll = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').read
    sys.stdout = open(sys.argv[2], 'w')
else:
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    readAll = sys.stdin.read
class InputData:

    def __init__(self):
        self.lines = readAll().split('\n')
        self.n = len(self.lines)
        self.ii = -1

    def input(self):
        self.ii += 1
        assert self.ii < self.n
        return self.lines[self.ii]
inputData = InputData()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, a and b are integers representing the number of boys and girls in the class respectively, k is an integer representing the number of couples ready to dance together, a list of k integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k is provided where each a_i is an integer between 1 and a inclusive, and a list of k integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_k is provided where each b_i is an integer between 1 and b inclusive.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly (since the annotated code snippet only shows the return statement without parameter definitions). It reads an integer input from the user and returns it. There are no actions performed on the input values `a`, `b`, `k`, `a_list`, or `b_list` as described in the annotations, which are likely incorrect or misleading. The function simply takes an integer input from the user and returns it without any further processing or use of the provided parameters.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The lists a_1, a_2, ..., a_k and b_1, b_2, ..., b_k are lists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of three integers obtained from user input, split and converted to integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three space-separated integers, and converts them to a list of integers. The function then returns this list. This process assumes the user inputs exactly three integers separated by spaces. If the input does not conform to this expectation (e.g., fewer than three integers, non-integer values, or values not separated by spaces), the function will not behave as intended and may result in incorrect behavior or errors.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, a, b, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The lists of integers a_1, a_2, …, a_k and b_1, b_2, …, b_k contain unique values within their respective ranges (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a) and (1 ≤ b_i ≤ b).
def func_3():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of input values for a_1, a_2, …, a_k and b_1, b_2, …, b_k
#Overall this is what the function does:- The function should explicitly define how the values for \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) are determined based on the predefined values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(k\). This could involve generating these values, retrieving them from a predefined list, or any other method specified by the problem context.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, a and b are integers representing the number of boys and girls respectively, k is an integer representing the number of couples ready to dance together, and the following two lines contain k integers each, representing the boy and girl numbers in the couples respectively.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns a string containing input from the user, which represents the input for the test case
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` does not accept any parameters and simply reads input from the user. This input is a string that contains multiple pieces of information separated by spaces, including the number of test cases, the number of boys and girls for each test case, the number of couples, and the specific boy and girl numbers in the couples. After executing, the function returns this string. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation, and the code itself only reads input without performing any additional actions or validations.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing the number of valid pairings for each test case, and sep is a string used to join the elements of l before printing.
def func_5(l, sep):
    print(sep.join(l))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers and a string `sep`. It joins the elements of `l` using `sep` and prints the result. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation or the code itself, so we can assume the function handles typical input scenarios properly. However, it is worth noting that the list `l` should contain only integers, and `sep` should be a string. If `l` contains non-integer values, a `TypeError` would occur, which is not handled within the function. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the joined string.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, a, b, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the lists a and b are of length k containing integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b respectively; the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; each pair (a_i, b_i) is unique within each test case.
def func_6():
    n, m, k = func_2()
    a = func_2()
    b = func_2()
    cntA = Counter(a)
    cntB = Counter(b)
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(k):
        ans += k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `m` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `k` is the same as before, `b` is the result of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `a`, `cntB` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `b`, `ans` is \(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (k - \text{cntA}[a[i]] - \text{cntB}[b[i]] + 1)\)
    print(ans / 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no explicit parameters and performs a series of operations internally. It first calls `func_2()` three times to get the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`. It then creates two `Counter` objects, `cntA` and `cntB`, to count the occurrences of elements in lists `a` and `b`, respectively. The function iterates over the lists `a` and `b` and calculates the value of `ans` based on the formula `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` for each element. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` divided by 2. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the lists `a` and `b` contain duplicate elements, and the overall sum of `a`, `b`, and `k` does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). However, the provided code does not handle these edge cases explicitly, and the overall functionality is to compute and print a specific value derived from the given inputs.
