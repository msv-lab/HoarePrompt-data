You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: At the school where Vasya is studying, preparations are underway for the graduation ceremony. One of the planned performances is a ball, which will be attended by pairs of boys and girls.

Each class must present two couples to the ball. In Vasya's class, a boys and b girls wish to participate. But not all boys and not all girls are ready to dance in pairs.

Formally, you know k possible one-boy-one-girl pairs. You need to choose two of these pairs so that no person is in more than one pair.

For example, if a=3, b=4, k=4 and the couples (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4) are ready to dance together (in each pair, the boy's number comes first, then the girl's number), then the following combinations of two pairs are possible (not all possible options are listed below): 

  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (3, 4) and (1, 3); 



But the following combinations are not possible: 

  * (1, 3) and (1, 2) — the first boy enters two pairs; 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 2) — the second girl enters two pairs; 



Find the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition above. Two ways are considered different if they consist of different pairs.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers a, b and k (1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of boys and girls in the class and the number of couples ready to dance together.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_1, a_2, … a_k. (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a), where a_i is the number of the boy in the pair with the number i.

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_1, b_2, … b_k. (1 ≤ b_i ≤ b), where b_i is the number of the girl in the pair with the number i.

It is guaranteed that the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

It is guaranteed that each pair is specified at most once in one test case.

Output

For each test case, on a separate line print one integer — the number of ways to choose two pairs that match the condition above.

Note

In the first test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 2) and (3, 4); 
  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 3) and (3, 4); 
  * (2, 2) and (3, 4). 



There is only one pair in the second test case.

In the third test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 1) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 1).

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, a and b are integers representing the number of boys and girls in the class respectively, k is an integer representing the number of couples ready to dance together, a list of k integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k is provided where each a_i is an integer between 1 and a inclusive, and a list of k integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_k is provided where each b_i is an integer between 1 and b inclusive.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly (since the annotated code snippet only shows the return statement without parameter definitions). It reads an integer input from the user and returns it. There are no actions performed on the input values `a`, `b`, `k`, `a_list`, or `b_list` as described in the annotations, which are likely incorrect or misleading. The function simply takes an integer input from the user and returns it without any further processing or use of the provided parameters.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The lists a_1, a_2, ..., a_k and b_1, b_2, ..., b_k are lists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of three integers obtained from user input, split and converted to integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three space-separated integers, and converts them to a list of integers. The function then returns this list. This process assumes the user inputs exactly three integers separated by spaces. If the input does not conform to this expectation (e.g., fewer than three integers, non-integer values, or values not separated by spaces), the function will not behave as intended and may result in incorrect behavior or errors.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, a, b, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The lists of integers a_1, a_2, …, a_k and b_1, b_2, …, b_k contain unique values within their respective ranges (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a) and (1 ≤ b_i ≤ b).
def func_3():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of input values for a_1, a_2, …, a_k and b_1, b_2, …, b_k
#Overall this is what the function does:- The function should explicitly define how the values for \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) are determined based on the predefined values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(k\). This could involve generating these values, retrieving them from a predefined list, or any other method specified by the problem context.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, a and b are integers representing the number of boys and girls respectively, k is an integer representing the number of couples ready to dance together, and the following two lines contain k integers each, representing the boy and girl numbers in the couples respectively.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns a string containing input from the user, which represents the input for the test case
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` does not accept any parameters and simply reads input from the user. This input is a string that contains multiple pieces of information separated by spaces, including the number of test cases, the number of boys and girls for each test case, the number of couples, and the specific boy and girl numbers in the couples. After executing, the function returns this string. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation, and the code itself only reads input without performing any additional actions or validations.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing the number of valid pairings for each test case, and sep is a string used to join the elements of l before printing.
def func_5(l, sep):
    print(sep.join(l))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers and a string `sep`. It joins the elements of `l` using `sep` and prints the result. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation or the code itself, so we can assume the function handles typical input scenarios properly. However, it is worth noting that the list `l` should contain only integers, and `sep` should be a string. If `l` contains non-integer values, a `TypeError` would occur, which is not handled within the function. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the joined string.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, a, b, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the lists a and b are of length k containing integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b respectively; the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; each pair (a_i, b_i) is unique within each test case.
def func_6():
    n, m, k = func_2()
    a = func_2()
    b = func_2()
    cntA = Counter(a)
    cntB = Counter(b)
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(k):
        ans += k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `m` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `k` is the same as before, `b` is the result of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `a`, `cntB` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `b`, `ans` is \(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (k - \text{cntA}[a[i]] - \text{cntB}[b[i]] + 1)\)
    print(ans / 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no explicit parameters and performs a series of operations internally. It first calls `func_2()` three times to get the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`. It then creates two `Counter` objects, `cntA` and `cntB`, to count the occurrences of elements in lists `a` and `b`, respectively. The function iterates over the lists `a` and `b` and calculates the value of `ans` based on the formula `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` for each element. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` divided by 2. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the lists `a` and `b` contain duplicate elements, and the overall sum of `a`, `b`, and `k` does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). However, the provided code does not handle these edge cases explicitly, and the overall functionality is to compute and print a specific value derived from the given inputs.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
