Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the selected pairs do not share any individuals. The calculation performed in the `func_6` function does not guarantee that no person is included in more than one pair. 

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

- \(a = 3\), \(b = 3\), \(k = 3\)
- Couples: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 2)\)

According to the problem description, the valid pairs are:
- \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 2)\)

However, the code would incorrectly count the pairs \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) as valid, because it only checks the counts of each individual in the list, without ensuring that the pairs themselves do not overlap.

This is a clear violation of the problem constraints, as both individuals in the pair \((1, 2)\) are included in another pair \((1, 1)\). Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
