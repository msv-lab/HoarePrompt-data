You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: At the school where Vasya is studying, preparations are underway for the graduation ceremony. One of the planned performances is a ball, which will be attended by pairs of boys and girls.

Each class must present two couples to the ball. In Vasya's class, a boys and b girls wish to participate. But not all boys and not all girls are ready to dance in pairs.

Formally, you know k possible one-boy-one-girl pairs. You need to choose two of these pairs so that no person is in more than one pair.

For example, if a=3, b=4, k=4 and the couples (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4) are ready to dance together (in each pair, the boy's number comes first, then the girl's number), then the following combinations of two pairs are possible (not all possible options are listed below): 

  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (3, 4) and (1, 3); 



But the following combinations are not possible: 

  * (1, 3) and (1, 2) — the first boy enters two pairs; 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 2) — the second girl enters two pairs; 



Find the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition above. Two ways are considered different if they consist of different pairs.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers a, b and k (1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of boys and girls in the class and the number of couples ready to dance together.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_1, a_2, … a_k. (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a), where a_i is the number of the boy in the pair with the number i.

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_1, b_2, … b_k. (1 ≤ b_i ≤ b), where b_i is the number of the girl in the pair with the number i.

It is guaranteed that the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

It is guaranteed that each pair is specified at most once in one test case.

Output

For each test case, on a separate line print one integer — the number of ways to choose two pairs that match the condition above.

Example

Note

In the first test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 2) and (3, 4); 
  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 3) and (3, 4); 
  * (2, 2) and (3, 4). 



There is only one pair in the second test case.

In the third test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 1) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 1).

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly (since the annotated code snippet only shows the return statement without parameter definitions). It reads an integer input from the user and returns it. There are no actions performed on the input values `a`, `b`, `k`, `a_list`, or `b_list` as described in the annotations, which are likely incorrect or misleading. The function simply takes an integer input from the user and returns it without any further processing or use of the provided parameters.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three space-separated integers, and converts them to a list of integers. The function then returns this list. This process assumes the user inputs exactly three integers separated by spaces. If the input does not conform to this expectation (e.g., fewer than three integers, non-integer values, or values not separated by spaces), the function will not behave as intended and may result in incorrect behavior or errors.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  - The function should explicitly define how the values for \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) are determined based on the predefined values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(k\). This could involve generating these values, retrieving them from a predefined list, or any other method specified by the problem context.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4()` does not accept any parameters and simply reads input from the user. This input is a string that contains multiple pieces of information separated by spaces, including the number of test cases, the number of boys and girls for each test case, the number of couples, and the specific boy and girl numbers in the couples. After executing, the function returns this string. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation, and the code itself only reads input without performing any additional actions or validations.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l, sep='\n'):
    print(sep.join(l))
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers and a string `sep`. It joins the elements of `l` using `sep` and prints the result. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation or the code itself, so we can assume the function handles typical input scenarios properly. However, it is worth noting that the list `l` should contain only integers, and `sep` should be a string. If `l` contains non-integer values, a `TypeError` would occur, which is not handled within the function. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the joined string.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    (n, m, k) = func_2()
    a = func_2()
    b = func_2()
    cntA = Counter(a)
    cntB = Counter(b)
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(k):
        ans += k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1
    print(ans / 2)
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function takes no explicit parameters and performs a series of operations internally. It first calls `func_2()` three times to get the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`. It then creates two `Counter` objects, `cntA` and `cntB`, to count the occurrences of elements in lists `a` and `b`, respectively. The function iterates over the lists `a` and `b` and calculates the value of `ans` based on the formula `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` for each element. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` divided by 2. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the lists `a` and `b` contain duplicate elements, and the overall sum of `a`, `b`, and `k` does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). However, the provided code does not handle these edge cases explicitly, and the overall functionality is to compute and print a specific value derived from the given inputs.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
