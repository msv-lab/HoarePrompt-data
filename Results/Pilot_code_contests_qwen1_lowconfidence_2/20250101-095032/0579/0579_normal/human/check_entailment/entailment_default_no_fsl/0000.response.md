Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the calculation of the number of ways to choose two pairs is incorrect. The formula used in the code:

```python
ans += k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1
```

is incorrect for calculating the number of valid pairs. Instead, it should calculate the number of ways to choose the second pair after selecting the first pair.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to count the number of valid pairs and then calculate the number of ways to choose two pairs from these valid pairs. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function `func_6`:

```python
def func_6():
    (n, m, k) = func_2()
    a = func_2()
    b = func_2()
    
    # Count the number of boys and girls in each couple
    cntA = Counter(a)
    cntB = Counter(b)
    
    # Count the number of ways to form valid pairs
    pairs = 0
    for i in range(k):
        ai = a[i]
        bi = b[i]
        if cntA[ai] > 1 and cntB[bi] > 1:
            pairs += 1
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 pairs from valid pairs
    if pairs >= 2:
        ans = pairs * (pairs - 1) // 2
    else:
        ans = 0
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version counts the number of valid pairs and then calculates the number of ways to choose two pairs from these valid pairs. The original code incorrectly attempts to calculate the number of ways to choose pairs without correctly counting the valid pairs.
