The code snippet `print(ans / 2)` prints the value of `ans` divided by 2. However, the value of `ans` is calculated using the values of `k`, `cntA`, and `cntB`, and does not change the values of the other variables. The division by 2 modifies the value of `ans`, but does not affect the other variables.

Therefore, the only change is in the value of `ans`, which is now `ans / 2`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `m` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `k` is the same as before, `b` is the result of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `a`, `cntB` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `b`, `ans` is \(\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (k - \text{cntA}[a[i]] - \text{cntB}[b[i]] + 1)}{2}\)**
