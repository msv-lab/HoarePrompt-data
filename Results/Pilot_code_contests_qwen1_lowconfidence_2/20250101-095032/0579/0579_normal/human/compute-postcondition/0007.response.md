`ans` is incremented by `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1`. The values of `k`, `cntA[a[i]]`, and `cntB[b[i]]` affect the new value of `ans`. Since the exact values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` are not specified, we cannot simplify the expression further. However, we know the initial value of `ans` is 0, so the updated value of `ans` is `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `m` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `k` must be greater than 0, `b` is the result of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `a`, `cntB` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `b`, `ans` is `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1`**
