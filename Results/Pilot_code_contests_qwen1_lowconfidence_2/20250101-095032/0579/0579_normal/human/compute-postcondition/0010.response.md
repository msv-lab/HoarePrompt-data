To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the variables change within the loop and what conditions must be met for the loop to continue executing.

Given:
- The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `k-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers from the function `func_2()`.
- `k` is the same as before.
- `b` is the result of `func_2()`.
- `cntA` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `a`.
- `cntB` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `b`.
- `ans` is given by the formula \(2k - \text{cntA}[a[i_end + 1]] - \text{cntB}[b[i_end + 1]] - \text{cntA}[a[i]] - \text{cntB}[b[i]] + 2\).

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `for i in range(k):` means the loop will execute for each value of `i` from `0` to `k-1`.
2. **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was `i_prev`. For the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.
3. **Other Variables**: The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `cntA`, `cntB`, and `ans` do not change within the loop unless explicitly modified inside the loop body, which is not provided here. Therefore, these variables remain the same as their values at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the loop continues as long as `i < k`, for the next iteration, `i` must be less than `k`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `cntA`, `cntB`, and `ans`) remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `m` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `k` is the same as before, `b` is the result of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `a`, `cntB` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `b`, `ans` is \(2k - \text{cntA}[a[i_end + 1]] - \text{cntB}[b[i_end + 1]] - \text{cntA}[a[i]] - \text{cntB}[b[i]] + 2\), `i` is `i_prev + 1**
