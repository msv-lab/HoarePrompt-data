According to the given code snippet, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer from the function `func_2()`
- `m` is an integer from the function `func_2()`
- `k` must be greater than 0 (though it was mentioned as being greater than 0, we should consider the actual value at the end of the last iteration)
- `b` is the result of `func_2()`
- `cntA` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `a`
- `cntB` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `b`
- `ans` is `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `i` must still be less than `k`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, say `i_end`.
2. The condition for the loop to continue is `i < k`.
3. To enter the next iteration, `i` needs to be `i_end + 1`.
4. Therefore, `i` becomes `i_end + 1`.

Given that `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and since `i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

The other states remain unchanged.

So, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `i` is now `i_end + 1`
- `k` remains the same as before the loop started or as determined at the end of the last iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `m` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `k` is the same as before, `b` is the result of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `a`, `cntB` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `b`, `ans` is `k - cntA[a[i_end + 1]] - cntB[b[i_end + 1]] + 1`**
