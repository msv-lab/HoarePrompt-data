`cntB` is assigned the value of `Counter(b)`. This means that `cntB` will count the occurrences of each element in the list `b`. The previous values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `m` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `k` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `b` is the result of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `a`, `cntB` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `b`**
