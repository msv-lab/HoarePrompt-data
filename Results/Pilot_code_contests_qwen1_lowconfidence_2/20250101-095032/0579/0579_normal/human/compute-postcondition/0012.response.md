Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `m` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `k` is the same as before, `b` is the result of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `a`, `cntB` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `b`, `ans` is \(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (k - \text{cntA}[a[i]] - \text{cntB}[b[i]] + 1)\)**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for `k` iterations, and in each iteration, `ans` is incremented by \((k - \text{cntA}[a[i]] - \text{cntB}[b[i]] + 1)\).
- After `k` iterations, the value of `ans` will be the sum of the increments over all iterations, which can be expressed as \(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (k - \text{cntA}[a[i]] - \text{cntB}[b[i]] + 1)\).

Since the loop always runs for `k` iterations under the given conditions, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `cntA`, and `cntB` remain unchanged. Only `ans` accumulates the sum based on the expression evaluated in each iteration.
