The code `n, m, k = func_2()` calls a function `func_2()` which returns three values, `n`, `m`, and `k`. These values are assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. Since the exact values returned by `func_2()` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. However, we know that they are integers, and they are derived from the function call.

The initial conditions for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `k` remain unchanged, except that now `n`, `m`, and `k` have new values from the function call.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `m` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, `k` is an integer from the function `func_2()`, for each test case, `a` and `b` are lists of length `k` containing integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b respectively, the sums of `a`, `b`, and `k` over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, each pair (a_i, b_i) is unique within each test case.**
