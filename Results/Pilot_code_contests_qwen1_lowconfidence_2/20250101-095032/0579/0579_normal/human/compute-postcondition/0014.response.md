The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition `def func_6()`. Given the constraints and the need to describe the functionality based on the provided information, we can infer that the function processes some internal data or possibly takes input from external sources that are not explicitly defined within the function itself.

Since the function definition does not include any parameters, the functionality description should reflect this:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns undefined based on internal processing or external input.**
