t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, a, b, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The lists a_1, a_2, ..., a_k and b_1, b_2, ..., b_k are lists of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b for all i, and each pair (a_i, b_i) is unique within the same test case.
