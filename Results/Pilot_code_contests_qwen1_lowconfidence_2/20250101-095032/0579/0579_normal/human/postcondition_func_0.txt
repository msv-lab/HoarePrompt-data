The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly (since the annotated code snippet only shows the return statement without parameter definitions). It reads an integer input from the user and returns it. There are no actions performed on the input values `a`, `b`, `k`, `a_list`, or `b_list` as described in the annotations, which are likely incorrect or misleading. The function simply takes an integer input from the user and returns it without any further processing or use of the provided parameters.
