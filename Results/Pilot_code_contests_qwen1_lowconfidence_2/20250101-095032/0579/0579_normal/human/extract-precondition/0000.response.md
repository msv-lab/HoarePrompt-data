Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, a, b, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the lists a and b are of length k containing integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b respectively; the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; each pair (a_i, b_i) is unique within each test case.**
