The function `func_4()` does not accept any parameters and simply reads input from the user. This input is a string that contains multiple pieces of information separated by spaces, including the number of test cases, the number of boys and girls for each test case, the number of couples, and the specific boy and girl numbers in the couples. After executing, the function returns this string. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation, and the code itself only reads input without performing any additional actions or validations.
