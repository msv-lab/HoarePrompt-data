Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program consists only of function declarations without any implementation. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are declared but not defined with any logic to solve the problem. The problem requires dividing the labs into groups such that the minimum number of units of water that can be transported from one group to another is maximized. However, the given code does not provide any logic to achieve this.

Since the program does not contain any implementation to solve the problem and thus cannot handle any input according to the problem description, it is incorrect.
