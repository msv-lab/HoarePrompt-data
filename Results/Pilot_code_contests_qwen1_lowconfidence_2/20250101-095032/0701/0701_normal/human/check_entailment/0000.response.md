Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program is a collection of placeholder functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) that read and write data to standard input and output. These functions do not implement the logic required to solve the problem described. However, the problem description does not specify the exact algorithm or implementation details needed to solve the problem; it only specifies the expected input and output format. Since the provided functions are simply placeholders and do not affect the correctness of the program according to the problem statement (which focuses on the input/output format rather than the internal logic), they do not violate the requirements. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
