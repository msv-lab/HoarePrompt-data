Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the program correctly reads the input \( n \) and divides the labs into \( n \) groups, each containing \( n \) labs, as described. The annotated version clearly shows that the program initializes \( n \) groups and assigns labs to these groups in a way that satisfies the problem constraints. Specifically, the program ensures that the labs are distributed such that the minimal number of units of water that can be transported from one group to another is maximized.

The annotated version confirms that the program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. The use of the function `func_1` to read the integer \( n \) and the subsequent allocation of labs to groups is consistent with the problem requirements. Furthermore, the output format matches the expected output, where each line contains \( n \) numbers representing the labs in each group.

Given that the annotated version aligns with the problem description and the original assessment, and there is no indication in the annotated version that suggests any logical errors or violations of the problem constraints, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
