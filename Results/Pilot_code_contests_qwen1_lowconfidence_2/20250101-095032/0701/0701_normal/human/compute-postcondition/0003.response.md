The code `sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')` will write the string representation of the first element in the `args` iterable followed by a space to the standard output (console). However, since the task is to provide the output state after executing the code and not to actually execute it, we will update the state of the variables accordingly.

- The first element of `args` (let's denote it as `first_arg`) will be converted to a string and concatenated with a space. This concatenated string will be written to the standard output, but the actual value of `args` itself will remain unchanged.
- The state of `sys.stdout` is not relevant to the output state we are providing.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable; first element of `args` is written to standard output as a string followed by a space**
