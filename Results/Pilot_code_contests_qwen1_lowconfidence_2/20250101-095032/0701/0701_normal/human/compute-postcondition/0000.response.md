According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` variable. Specifically, the loop requires that `args` is a non-empty iterable (such as a list, tuple, etc.) because the loop iterates over each element in `args`.

Given that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300\) and the function does not use the value of `n` or any other argument passed to it, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `args` is a non-empty iterable.

State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable**
