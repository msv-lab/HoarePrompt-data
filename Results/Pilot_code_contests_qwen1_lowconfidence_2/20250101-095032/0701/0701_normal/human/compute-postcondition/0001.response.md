`sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')` writes the string representation of `s` (which is an element from the `args` iterable) followed by a space to the standard output. The `args` iterable itself is not modified by this operation. Therefore, the only change is in the standard output, but since we are focusing on the variables' states, no variables are updated or created by this line of code.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable**
