The code `sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')` writes the second element of `args` (which is `s`) to the standard output as a string followed by a space. This operation does not change the value of `args`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that the second element of `args` has been written to the standard output.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable, and the second element of `args` has been written to standard output as a string followed by a space**
