The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters since there is no parameter listed in the function definition. The function simply does not use any arguments and does not rely on any external input. Given the constraints and the output, the function likely returns a constant value or performs some internal operation unrelated to the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a constant value or performs an operation unrelated to the input constraints.**
