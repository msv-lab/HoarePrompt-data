The code `sys.stdout.write('\n')` writes a newline character to the standard output. This does not change the value of the `args` variable or any other variables. The initial state where `args` is a non-empty iterable and its elements have been written to standard output as strings, each followed by a space, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable, and all elements of `args` have been written to standard output as strings, each followed by a space.**
