According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop iterates over each element in `args`. At the end of the last iteration, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and the first element of `args` has been written to standard output as a string followed by a space.

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still be a non-empty iterable, and the next element in `args` will be processed.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable, and the second element of `args` is ready to be written to standard output as a string followed by a space**
