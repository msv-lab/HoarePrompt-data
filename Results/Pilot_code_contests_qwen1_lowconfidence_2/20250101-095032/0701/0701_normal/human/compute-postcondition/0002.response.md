According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` iterable. For the loop to execute again, `args` must still be a non-empty iterable.

At the end of the previous iteration, `args` is a non-empty iterable. For the loop to continue executing, `args` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable**
