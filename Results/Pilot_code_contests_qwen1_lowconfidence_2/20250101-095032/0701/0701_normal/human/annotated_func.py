#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are defined or passed within the function signature. The function does not take any parameters and reads input from stdin.
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer input read from standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer input from standard input (stdin) and returns it. There are no parameters passed to the function. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-integer values, which would result in a `ValueError` when attempting to convert the input to an integer. In such cases, the function should handle these exceptions to ensure robust behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no input for this function, and it is assumed that the input values are read from standard input by some other part of the program.
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers converted from the input values split from the first line of standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a single line of input from standard input, splits the line into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. There are no parameters accepted by the function. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing non-integer values, which would result in a ValueError when attempting to convert the strings to integers. If the input is empty, the function will still attempt to split and convert, leading to an empty map being returned. If the input contains non-integer values, a ValueError will be raised.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline()
    #The program returns an input value from standard input, which is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` accepts no parameters and reads an integer value from standard input. This integer value must be within the range of 2 to 300 (inclusive). If the user inputs a number outside this range, the function will continue to prompt for input until a valid number within the specified range is entered. After reading the valid integer, the function returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300. The function does not use the value of n or any other argument passed to it.
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a non-empty iterable, and all elements of `args` have been written to standard output as strings, each followed by a space.
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It iterates over the elements in the `args` iterable, writing each element as a string to standard output followed by a space. After the loop, it writes a newline character to standard output. There are no input constraints specified for `args`, and the function assumes `args` is a non-empty iterable containing elements that can be converted to strings. If `args` is empty, the function will simply write a newline character to standard output.
