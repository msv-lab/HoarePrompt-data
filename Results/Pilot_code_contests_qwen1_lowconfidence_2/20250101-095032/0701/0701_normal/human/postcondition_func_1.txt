The function `func_2` reads a single line of input from standard input, splits the line into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. There are no parameters accepted by the function. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing non-integer values, which would result in a ValueError when attempting to convert the strings to integers. If the input is empty, the function will still attempt to split and convert, leading to an empty map being returned. If the input contains non-integer values, a ValueError will be raised.
