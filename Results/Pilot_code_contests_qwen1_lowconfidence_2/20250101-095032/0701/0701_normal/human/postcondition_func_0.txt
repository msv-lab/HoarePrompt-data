The function reads an integer input from standard input (stdin) and returns it. There are no parameters passed to the function. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-integer values, which would result in a `ValueError` when attempting to convert the input to an integer. In such cases, the function should handle these exceptions to ensure robust behavior.
