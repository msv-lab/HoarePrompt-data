The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It iterates over the elements in the `args` iterable, writing each element as a string to standard output followed by a space. After the loop, it writes a newline character to standard output. There are no input constraints specified for `args`, and the function assumes `args` is a non-empty iterable containing elements that can be converted to strings. If `args` is empty, the function will simply write a newline character to standard output.
