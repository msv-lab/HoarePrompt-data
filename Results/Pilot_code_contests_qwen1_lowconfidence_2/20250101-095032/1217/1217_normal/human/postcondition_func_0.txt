The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns the value of `a`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (i.e., `a % b`). This process continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns the value of `a`. This function effectively computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
