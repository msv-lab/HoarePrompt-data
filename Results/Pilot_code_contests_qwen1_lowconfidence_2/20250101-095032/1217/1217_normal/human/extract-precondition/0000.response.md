Precondition: **n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10⁵). a is a list of integers where a[i-1] represents the number written on vertex i (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ a[i-1] ≤ 2·10⁵). parent is a list of integers where parent[i-1] represents the parent of vertex i in the tree (1 ≤ i ≤ n, parent[0] = -1). gcdinfo is a list of GCDInfo objects, where gcdinfo[i-1] corresponds to vertex i, and visited is a boolean list indicating whether vertex i has been visited (visited[i-1] is initially False for all i). graph is a list of lists where graph[i] contains the neighbors of vertex i.**
