Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the case where the number in one arbitrary vertex is changed to 0. According to the problem description, Ilya can change the number in one arbitrary vertex to 0 or leave all vertices unchanged. The provided `func_2` function does not account for this possibility. Specifically, the function does not update the GCD values correctly when a vertex's value is set to 0. This oversight leads to incorrect results, as demonstrated by the example input provided:

**Input:**
```
3
4 2 3
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4 4 4
```

However, the actual output will not reflect this scenario correctly because the function does not properly handle the case where a vertex's value is set to 0. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the original assessment is accurate.
