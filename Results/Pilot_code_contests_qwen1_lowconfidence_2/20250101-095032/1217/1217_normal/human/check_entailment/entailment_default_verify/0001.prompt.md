You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ilya is very fond of graphs, especially trees. During his last trip to the forest Ilya found a very interesting tree rooted at vertex 1. There is an integer number written on each vertex of the tree; the number written on vertex i is equal to ai.

Ilya believes that the beauty of the vertex x is the greatest common divisor of all numbers written on the vertices on the path from the root to x, including this vertex itself. In addition, Ilya can change the number in one arbitrary vertex to 0 or leave all vertices unchanged. Now for each vertex Ilya wants to know the maximum possible beauty it can have.

For each vertex the answer must be considered independently.

The beauty of the root equals to number written on it.

Input

First line contains one integer number n — the number of vertices in tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105).

Next line contains n integer numbers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 2·105).

Each of next n - 1 lines contains two integer numbers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, x ≠ y), which means that there is an edge (x, y) in the tree.

Output

Output n numbers separated by spaces, where i-th number equals to maximum possible beauty of vertex i.

#Function 1:

    return a if b == 0 else func_1(b, a % b)

                gcdinfo[n].tor2 = gcdinfo[parent].gcd
                gcdinfo[n].ifr2 = a[n]

                newgcd2 = 1
            if newgcd1 > newgcd2:

                gcdinfo[n].ifr1 = gcdinfo[parent].ifr1
            elif newgcd2 > newgcd1:
                gcdinfo[n].tor1 = gcdinfo[parent].tor2

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the number at a vertex is changed to 0. According to the problem description, Ilya can change the number in one arbitrary vertex to 0 or leave all vertices unchanged. However, the program does not account for this scenario. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not consider the case where changing a vertex to 0 might increase the beauty of other vertices.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3
6 2 3
1 2
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
6 6 6
```

However, the program does not produce the expected output because it does not handle the case where changing one of the vertices to 0 could potentially maximize the beauty of the other vertices. For instance, if we change the value of vertex 3 to 0, the beauty of vertex 2 would be max(6, gcd(6, 0)) = 6, and the beauty of vertex 1 would also remain 6. Therefore, the program fails to consider this scenario, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes a tree structure represented by `n` (number of vertices), `parent` (parent pointers), `gcdinfo` (GCD information for each vertex), `a` (values associated with each vertex), and `graph` (adjacency list). It traverses the tree using depth-first search (DFS) and updates the `gcdinfo` list for each vertex based on the values and GCD calculations involving its children and parent. Specifically, for each vertex `n`, it checks if it has been visited, updates its visited status, and calculates the GCD of its value with the GCD of its parent. Depending on the result, it updates the `gcdinfo` list with relevant values. It also recursively processes each neighbor of the current vertex.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
