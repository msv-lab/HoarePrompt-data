Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the scenario where the value of a vertex is changed to 0. According to the problem description, Ilya can change the number in one arbitrary vertex to 0 or leave all vertices unchanged. However, the code does not account for the case where changing a vertex to 0 would increase the maximum possible beauty for other vertices.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this issue:

**Input:**
```
3
6 2 3
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6 6 6
```

In this example, if we change the value of vertex 2 to 0, the path from the root to vertex 2 would be [6, 0], and the GCD of this path would be 6. The GCD of the path from the root to vertex 3 would remain 3, but the GCD of the path from the root to vertex 1 would now be 6. Therefore, the maximum possible beauty for vertex 2 would be 6, and similarly for vertex 3.

However, the current implementation does not consider this possibility. It only updates the GCD based on the existing values and does not account for the potential increase in beauty by setting a value to 0.

To fix this, the code needs to include logic to check the GCD after setting a vertex to 0 for each vertex. This requires additional recursive calls and updates to the `gcdinfo` list, which is not present in the current implementation.
