Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the number at a vertex is changed to 0. According to the problem description, Ilya can change the number in one arbitrary vertex to 0 or leave all vertices unchanged. However, the program does not account for this scenario. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not consider the case where changing a vertex to 0 might increase the beauty of other vertices.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3
6 2 3
1 2
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
6 6 6
```

However, the program does not produce the expected output because it does not handle the case where changing one of the vertices to 0 could potentially maximize the beauty of the other vertices. For instance, if we change the value of vertex 3 to 0, the beauty of vertex 2 would be max(6, gcd(6, 0)) = 6, and the beauty of vertex 1 would also remain 6. Therefore, the program fails to consider this scenario, making it incorrect.
