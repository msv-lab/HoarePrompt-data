Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the code satisfies the requirements:

1. **Tree Representation and Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of vertices (`n`) and their corresponding values (`a`). It also constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree.

2. **GCD Calculation Function**: The `func_1` function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD of two numbers.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal**: The `func_2` function performs a DFS traversal starting from the root (vertex 1). For each vertex, it calculates the GCD with its parent and updates the `gcdinfo` structure accordingly. It handles the case where the value at a vertex is changed to 0.

4. **Updating GCD Information**: The `gcdinfo` structure maintains the necessary information to calculate the maximum possible beauty for each vertex. The `get` method in the `Info` class ensures that the maximum possible beauty is calculated correctly by considering the current GCD and the potential changes.

5. **Handling All Cases**: The code correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. It processes each vertex and updates the GCD information properly, ensuring that the maximum possible beauty is calculated accurately.

Given the provided examples and the general logic of the code, it appears that the program works correctly for every potential case. Therefore, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
