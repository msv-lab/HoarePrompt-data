Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the code meets the requirements:

1. **Tree Representation**: The tree is correctly represented using an adjacency list, and the input is processed accordingly.
2. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.
3. **DFS Traversal**: The `func_2` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree, updating the GCD information for each vertex as required.
4. **GCD Information Update**: For each vertex, the code correctly updates the GCD information considering the possibility of changing the value of one vertex to 0.
5. **Result Calculation**: The code calculates the maximum possible beauty for each vertex by considering the GCD of the path from the root to that vertex, including the possibility of changing one vertex's value to 0.

The annotations provide additional context and confirm the logical steps within the functions. The code handles all described cases and potential scenarios without missing any edge cases or misinterpretations of the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
