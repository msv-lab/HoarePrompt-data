You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ilya is very fond of graphs, especially trees. During his last trip to the forest Ilya found a very interesting tree rooted at vertex 1. There is an integer number written on each vertex of the tree; the number written on vertex i is equal to ai.

Ilya believes that the beauty of the vertex x is the greatest common divisor of all numbers written on the vertices on the path from the root to x, including this vertex itself. In addition, Ilya can change the number in one arbitrary vertex to 0 or leave all vertices unchanged. Now for each vertex Ilya wants to know the maximum possible beauty it can have.

For each vertex the answer must be considered independently.

The beauty of the root equals to number written on it.

Input

First line contains one integer number n — the number of vertices in tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105).

Next line contains n integer numbers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 2·105).

Each of next n - 1 lines contains two integer numbers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, x ≠ y), which means that there is an edge (x, y) in the tree.

Output

Output n numbers separated by spaces, where i-th number equals to maximum possible beauty of vertex i.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns the value of `a`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (i.e., `a % b`). This process continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns the value of `a`. This function effectively computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` processes a tree structure represented by `n` (number of vertices), `parent` (parent pointers), `gcdinfo` (GCD information for each vertex), `a` (values associated with each vertex), and `graph` (adjacency list). It traverses the tree using depth-first search (DFS) and updates the `gcdinfo` list for each vertex based on the values and GCD calculations involving its children and parent. Specifically, for each vertex `n`, it checks if it has been visited, updates its visited status, and calculates the GCD of its value with the GCD of its parent. Depending on the result, it updates the `gcdinfo` list with relevant values. It also recursively processes each neighbor of the current vertex.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
