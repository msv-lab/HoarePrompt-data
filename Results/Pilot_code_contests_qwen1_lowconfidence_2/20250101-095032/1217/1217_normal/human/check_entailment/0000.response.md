Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for finding the maximum possible beauty for each vertex in the tree. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where the number in one arbitrary vertex is changed to 0. 

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
3
4 2 3
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4 4 4
```

**Actual Output:**
The provided code will not correctly handle this scenario. For instance, when the number in vertex 2 is changed to 0, the gcd path from the root to vertex 3 should still be 2 (since the path is 1 -> 3 and the gcd of 4 and 3 is 1, but changing 2 to 0 results in 3, and the gcd of 4 and 3 is 1, not 2). However, the current implementation does not account for this properly.

To fix this, we need to ensure that when a vertex's value is changed to 0, we correctly update the gcd values along the path from the root to that vertex. The current implementation does not handle this scenario adequately. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
