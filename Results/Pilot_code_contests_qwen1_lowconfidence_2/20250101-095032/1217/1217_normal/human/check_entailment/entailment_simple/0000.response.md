Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Initialization of `gcdinfo`**: The initial values of `gcdinfo` are set incorrectly. Specifically, `gcdinfo[n].tor1` and `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` should be initialized to `0` for all nodes except the root node (vertex 1), where `tor1` should be `a[0]`.

2. **Recursive Function `func_2`**: The recursive function `func_2` is intended to propagate the maximum possible beauty for each vertex. However, the logic inside the function is flawed:
   - The function does not correctly update the `tor1` and `ifr1` attributes for non-root nodes.
   - The function assumes that `parent` is passed as a separate argument, but it should be inferred from the adjacency list representation of the graph.
   - The function does not handle the case where the node can be changed to `0` to maximize the beauty.

3. **Final Output**: The final output is constructed using `gcdinfo[i].get()` for each vertex, which does not reflect the intended behavior. The `get` method should return the maximum possible beauty, but the current implementation does not ensure that all possible changes are considered.

### Correct Implementation

Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the problem description:

```python
from math import gcd

def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        x -= 1
        y -= 1
        graph[x].append(y)
        graph[y].append(x)
    
    gcdinfo = [0] * n
    
    def dfs(node, parent):
        if parent != -1:
            # Calculate the GCD of the path from root to this node
            new_gcd = gcd(gcdinfo[parent], a[node])
            # Update the GCD information
            if new_gcd > gcdinfo[node]:
                gcdinfo[node] = new_gcd
            # Check if changing the node's value to 0 could increase the GCD
            if new_gcd < gcdinfo[parent]:
                if gcdinfo[node] == 0:
                    gcdinfo[node] = gcdinfo[parent]
                else:
                    gcdinfo[node] = max(gcdinfo[node], gcdinfo[parent])
        
        for child in graph[node]:
            if child != parent:
                dfs(child, node)
    
    # Initialize root node
    gcdinfo[0] = a[0]
    dfs(0, -1)
    
    # Output the maximum possible beauty for each vertex
    print(' '.join(map(str, gcdinfo)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Corrected Code

1. **Initialization**: The `gcdinfo` array is initialized with zeros. The root node is set to its own value.
2. **DFS Traversal**: The DFS function updates the `gcdinfo` array for each node by considering the GCD of the path from the root to the current node. It also checks if changing the node's value to `0` can increase the GCD.
3. **Output**: The final output is constructed by printing the `gcdinfo` array, which contains the maximum possible beauty for each vertex.

This corrected version ensures that the program meets the problem description and handles all cases as specified.
