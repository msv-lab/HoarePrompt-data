You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ilya is very fond of graphs, especially trees. During his last trip to the forest Ilya found a very interesting tree rooted at vertex 1. There is an integer number written on each vertex of the tree; the number written on vertex i is equal to ai.

Ilya believes that the beauty of the vertex x is the greatest common divisor of all numbers written on the vertices on the path from the root to x, including this vertex itself. In addition, Ilya can change the number in one arbitrary vertex to 0 or leave all vertices unchanged. Now for each vertex Ilya wants to know the maximum possible beauty it can have.

For each vertex the answer must be considered independently.

The beauty of the root equals to number written on it.

Input

First line contains one integer number n — the number of vertices in tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105).

Next line contains n integer numbers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 2·105).

Each of next n - 1 lines contains two integer numbers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, x ≠ y), which means that there is an edge (x, y) in the tree.

Output

Output n numbers separated by spaces, where i-th number equals to maximum possible beauty of vertex i.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for finding the maximum possible beauty for each vertex in the tree. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where the number in one arbitrary vertex is changed to 0. 

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
3
4 2 3
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4 4 4
```

**Actual Output:**
The provided code will not correctly handle this scenario. For instance, when the number in vertex 2 is changed to 0, the gcd path from the root to vertex 3 should still be 2 (since the path is 1 -> 3 and the gcd of 4 and 3 is 1, but changing 2 to 0 results in 3, and the gcd of 4 and 3 is 1, not 2). However, the current implementation does not account for this properly.

To fix this, we need to ensure that when a vertex's value is changed to 0, we correctly update the gcd values along the path from the root to that vertex. The current implementation does not handle this scenario adequately. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

n = int(raw_input())
a = map(int, raw_input().split())

for i in xrange(n - 1):
    (x, y) = map(int, raw_input().split())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if b == 0 else func_1(b, a % b)
    #`The program returns the value of 'a' if 'b' is 0, otherwise it returns the result of the function call 'func_1(b, a % b)' where 'a % b' is the remainder when 'a' is divided by 'b'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns the value of `a`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (i.e., `a % b`). This process continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns the value of `a`. This function effectively computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.

Depending on the result, it updates the `gcdinfo` list with relevant values. It also recursively processes each neighbor of the current vertex.
