The function `func_2(neigh, n)` is called with `neigh` as the first argument and `n` as the second argument. However, since the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine what changes are made inside the function. The only thing we know for certain is that the arguments passed to the function are `neigh` and `n`. 

The initial state is that `graph[n]` contains at least two neighbors, and `neigh` is one of those neighbors.

Since no variables are updated or modified within the function call itself, the only thing that changes is that the function is called with these arguments. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[n]` contains at least two neighbors, `neigh` is one of those neighbors, `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called.**
