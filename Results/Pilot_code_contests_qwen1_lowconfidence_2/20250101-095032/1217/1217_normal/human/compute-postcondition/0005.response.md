The code updates the `newgcd` variable with the result of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. `gcdinfo[parent]` is accessed, which retrieves the `GCDInfo` object corresponding to the parent of the current vertex.
2. `.gcd` is accessed from this `GCDInfo` object, which is the GCD value associated with the parent vertex.
3. `a[n]` accesses the integer value stored at index `n-1` in the list `a`, which represents the number written on the current vertex.
4. `func_1` is called with these two values, and the result is assigned to `newgcd`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `newgcd`. However, we know that `newgcd` is now equal to the result of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newgcd` is the result of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i-1]` represents the number written on vertex `i`, `parent` is a list of integers where `parent[i-1]` represents the parent of vertex `i` in the tree, `gcdinfo` is a list of GCDInfo objects, where `gcdinfo[i-1]` corresponds to vertex `i`, `visited` is a boolean list indicating whether vertex `i` has been visited, `graph` is a list of lists where `graph[i]` contains the neighbors of vertex `i`. The current value of `parent` is not `-1`. Not all vertices have been visited (`visited[n]` is `False`).**
