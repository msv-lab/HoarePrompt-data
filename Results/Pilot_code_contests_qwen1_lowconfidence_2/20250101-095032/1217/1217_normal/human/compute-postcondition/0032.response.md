Postcondition: ***`newgcd1` is `func_1(True, a[n])` if `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` is true; otherwise, `newgcd1` is `result_of_func_1` if `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is true, otherwise `newgcd1` is 1. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i-1]` represents the number written on vertex `i`, `parent` is a list of integers where `parent[i-1]` represents the parent of vertex `i` in the tree, `gcdinfo` is a list of GCDInfo objects, where `gcdinfo[i-1]` corresponds to vertex `i`, `visited` is a boolean list indicating whether vertex `i` has been visited, `graph` is a list of lists where `graph[i]` contains the neighbors of vertex `i`, `newgcd2` is less than or equal to `newgcd1`, and `gcdinfo[n].gcd` remains unchanged. If `newgcd2 > newgcd1`, then `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is now equal to `gcdinfo[parent].tor2` and `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is now equal to `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2`.***
