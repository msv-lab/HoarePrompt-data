Postcondition: **`newgcd` is now `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i-1]` represents the number written on vertex `i`, `parent` is a list of integers where `parent[i-1]` represents the parent of vertex `i` in the tree, `gcdinfo` is a list of GCDInfo objects, where `gcdinfo[i-1]` corresponds to vertex `i`, `visited` is a boolean list indicating whether vertex `i` has been visited, `graph` is a list of lists where `graph[i]` contains the neighbors of vertex `i`, `gcdinfo[parent].gcd` is updated to `newgcd`, `newgcd` is less than `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is now `a[n]`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is now `newgcd`, and `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is equal to `0`.**
