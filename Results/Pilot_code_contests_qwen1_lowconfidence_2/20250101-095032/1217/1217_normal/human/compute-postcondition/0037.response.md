The function `func_2(neigh, n)` is called with `neigh` as the first argument and `n` as the second argument. However, the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine what changes, if any, this function might make to the variables. Given that no local variables are being assigned within the snippet provided, the only variables affected are `neigh` and `n`. Since `graph[n]` must contain at least one neighbor, `neigh` would be a neighbor of `n`, but the specifics of what `neigh` is cannot be determined without knowing the contents of `func_2`.

Therefore, the output state includes the fact that `graph[n]` contains at least one neighbor, which implies that `neigh` is one of those neighbors.

Output State: **`graph[n]` contains at least one neighbor (neigh is one of those neighbors)**
