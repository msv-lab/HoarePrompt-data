Postcondition: ***`newgcd` is now `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i-1]` represents the number written on vertex `i`, `parent` is a list of integers where `parent[i-1]` represents the parent of vertex `i` in the tree, `gcdinfo` is a list of GCDInfo objects, where `gcdinfo[i-1]` corresponds to vertex `i`, `visited` is a boolean list indicating whether vertex `i` has been visited, `graph` is a list of lists where `graph[i]` contains the neighbors of vertex `i`, and `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated as follows:
- If `newgcd < gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, then `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is set to `a[n]`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is set to `newgcd`, `gcdinfo[n].tor2` is set to `newgcd`, and `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` is set to `a[n]`. Additionally, if `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1 == 0`, then `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is set to `0`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- If `newgcd >= gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, then `newgcd1` is calculated as `func_1(True, a[n])` if `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` is true, otherwise `newgcd1` is `result_of_func_1` if `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is true, otherwise `newgcd1` is 1. `gcdinfo[n].gcd` remains unchanged. If `newgcd1 > newgcd2`, then `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is set to `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1`. Otherwise, `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is set to `gcdinfo[parent].tor2` and `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is set to `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2`.***
