The code `gcdinfo[n].ifr1 = gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` assigns the value of `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` to `gcdinfo[n].ifr1`. This does not affect the values of `newgcd1`, `newgcd2`, `n`, `a`, `parent`, `gcdinfo`, `visited`, or `graph`. The value of `gcdinfo[n].gcd` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`newgcd1` is `func_1(True, a[n])` if `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` is true; otherwise, `newgcd1` is `result_of_func_1` if `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is true, otherwise `newgcd1` is 1. `newgcd2` is less than `newgcd1`. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i-1]` represents the number written on vertex `i`, `parent` is a list of integers where `parent[i-1]` represents the parent of vertex `i` in the tree, `gcdinfo` is a list of GCDInfo objects, where `gcdinfo[i-1]` corresponds to vertex `i`, `visited` is a boolean list indicating whether vertex `i` has been visited, `graph` is a list of lists where `graph[i]` contains the neighbors of vertex `i`, `gcdinfo[n].gcd` remains unchanged; `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is now equal to `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1`.**
