Postcondition: **`newgcd` is now `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i-1]` represents the number written on vertex `i`, `parent` is a list of integers where `parent[i-1]` represents the parent of vertex `i` in the tree, `gcdinfo` is a list of GCDInfo objects, where `gcdinfo[i-1]` corresponds to vertex `i`, `visited` is a boolean list indicating whether vertex `i` has been visited, `graph` is a list of lists where `graph[i]` contains the neighbors of vertex `i`, and `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is not less than `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`**
