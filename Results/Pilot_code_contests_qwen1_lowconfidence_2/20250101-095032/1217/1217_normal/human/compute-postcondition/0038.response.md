According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph[n]`. The loop iterates over all neighbors of `graph[n]`. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[n]` contains at least one neighbor, and `neigh` is one of those neighbors.

For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[n]` must contain at least one additional neighbor. Therefore, we need to ensure that there is at least one more neighbor available for iteration.

State: **`graph[n]` contains at least two neighbors (neigh is one of those neighbors)**
