According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `neigh`. For the loop to execute again, `neigh` must be one of the neighbors of `graph[n]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
- `graph[n]` contains at least two neighbors.
- `neigh` is one of those neighbors.
- `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `neigh` is still a valid neighbor of `graph[n]` (since `graph[n]` contains at least two neighbors, there are multiple possible values for `neigh`). The call to `func_2(neigh, n)` ensures that each neighbor is processed exactly once.

Since the loop is iterating over all neighbors of `graph[n]`, and assuming each neighbor is processed only once, for the loop to execute again, `neigh` must be updated to the next neighbor in the iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`graph[n]` contains at least two neighbors, `neigh` is one of those neighbors, `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called.**
