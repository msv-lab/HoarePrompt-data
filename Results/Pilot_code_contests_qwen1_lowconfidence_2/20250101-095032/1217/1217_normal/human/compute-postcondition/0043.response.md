The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `parent`, `gcdinfo`, `a`, and `graph`. Here are the details:

- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10⁵).
- `parent` is a list of integers where `parent[i-1]` represents the parent of vertex `i` in the tree (1 ≤ i ≤ n, parent[0] = -1).
- `gcdinfo` is a list of GCDInfo objects, where `gcdinfo[i-1]` corresponds to vertex `i`.
- `a` is a list of integers where `a[i-1]` represents the number written on vertex `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ a[i-1] ≤ 2·10⁵).
- `graph` is a list of lists where `graph[i]` contains the neighbors of vertex `i`.

Since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet, the function does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `parent`, `gcdinfo`, `a`, and `graph`, and does not return any value.**
