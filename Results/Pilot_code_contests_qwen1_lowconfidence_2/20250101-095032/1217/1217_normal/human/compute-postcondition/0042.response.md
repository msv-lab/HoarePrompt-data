To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n`: Integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `a`: List of integers where `a[i-1]` represents the number written on vertex `i`.
- `parent`: List of integers where `parent[i-1]` represents the parent of vertex `i` in the tree.
- `gcdinfo`: List of `GCDInfo` objects, where `gcdinfo[i-1]` corresponds to vertex `i`.
- `visited`: Boolean list indicating whether vertex `i` has been visited.
- `graph`: List of lists where `graph[i]` contains the neighbors of vertex `i`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each neighbor of vertex `n` and calls `func_2(neigh, n)`. This means that every vertex in the graph will eventually be processed by this loop, either directly or indirectly through recursive calls.

### Output State After All Iterations:
Since the loop iterates over all neighbors of `n` and each neighbor will eventually be processed (either directly or through recursive calls), we need to consider the state of all vertices in the graph.

#### Key Observations:
1. **`graph[n]`**: Will contain all neighbors of vertex `n`.
2. **`func_2(neigh, n)`**: Will be called for each neighbor `neigh` of vertex `n`.

### Detailed Analysis:
- Each call to `func_2(neigh, n)` will update the `GCDInfo` object corresponding to vertex `neigh` based on the logic provided.
- The updates to `gcdinfo` will be propagated through the tree due to the nature of the recursive calls.

### Final State:
After all iterations of the loop, every vertex in the graph will have had its `GCDInfo` object updated based on the rules provided. Specifically, the `GCDInfo` object for each vertex will reflect the final state of its `gcd`, `tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, and `ifr2` fields.

### Output State:
- `graph[n]`: Will contain all neighbors of vertex `n`.
- `func_2(neigh, n)` will have been called for each neighbor `neigh` of vertex `n`.

### Final Output State:
**Output State: **`graph[n]` contains all neighbors of vertex `n`, `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called for each neighbor `neigh` of vertex `n`, and the `GCDInfo` object for each vertex reflects the final state of its `gcd`, `tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, and `ifr2` fields.**
