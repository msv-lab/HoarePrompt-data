Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10⁵), `a` is a list of integers where `a[i-1]` represents the number written on vertex `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ `a[i-1]` ≤ 2·10⁵), `parent` is a list of integers where `parent[i-1]` represents the parent of vertex `i` in the tree (1 ≤ i ≤ n, `parent[0] = -1`), `gcdinfo` is a list of GCDInfo objects, where `gcdinfo[i-1]` corresponds to vertex `i`, `visited` is a boolean list indicating whether vertex `i` has been visited (`visited[n]` is `True`), `graph` is a list of lists where `graph[i]` contains the neighbors of vertex `i`. The current value of `parent` is not `-1`. Not all vertices have been visited (`visited[n]` is `False`).***
