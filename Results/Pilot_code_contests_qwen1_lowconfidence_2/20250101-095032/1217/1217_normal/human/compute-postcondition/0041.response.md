The function `func_2(neigh, n)` is called, which impacts the `neigh` and `n` variables. However, the specific changes made by `func_2` are not detailed, so we know that `func_2` has been executed, and the states of `graph[n]` and `neigh` may have been altered by its execution. The initial conditions that `graph[n]` contains at least two neighbors and `neigh` is one of those neighbors remain true.

Output State: **`graph[n]` contains at least two neighbors, `neigh` is one of those neighbors, `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called**
