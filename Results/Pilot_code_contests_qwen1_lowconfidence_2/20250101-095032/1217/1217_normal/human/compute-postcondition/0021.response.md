`newgcd2` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr2, a[n])`. Since `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` is true, the function `func_1` is called with `True` and `a[n]` as arguments. The value of `newgcd1` is updated to this new value, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newgcd1` is now `func_1(True, a[n])`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i-1]` represents the number written on vertex `i`, `parent` is a list of integers where `parent[i-1]` represents the parent of vertex `i` in the tree, `gcdinfo` is a list of GCDInfo objects, where `gcdinfo[i-1]` corresponds to vertex `i`, `visited` is a boolean list indicating whether vertex `i` has been visited, `graph` is a list of lists where `graph[i]` contains the neighbors of vertex `i`, and `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` is true. `gcdinfo[n].gcd` remains unchanged.**
