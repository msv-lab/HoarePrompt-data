The code updates the value of `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` to `a[n]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically:

- `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` is now equal to `a[n]`.
- All other variables (`newgcd`, `n`, `a`, `parent`, `gcdinfo`, `visited`, `graph`, `gcdinfo[n].tor1`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1`, `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1`, `gcdinfo[n].tor2`) retain their initial values.

Output State: **`newgcd` is now `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i-1]` represents the number written on vertex `i`, `parent` is a list of integers where `parent[i-1]` represents the parent of vertex `i` in the tree, `gcdinfo` is a list of GCDInfo objects, where `gcdinfo[i-1]` corresponds to vertex `i`, `visited` is a boolean list indicating whether vertex `i` has been visited, `graph` is a list of lists where `graph[i]` contains the neighbors of vertex `i`, `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is now `a[n]`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is now `newgcd`, `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is equal to `0`, `gcdinfo[n].tor2` is equal to `newgcd`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` is equal to `a[n]`.**
