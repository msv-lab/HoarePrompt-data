The code sets `newgcd2` to 1. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the only change is that `newgcd2` is now 1. The other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`newgcd1` is `result_of_func_1` if `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is true. Otherwise, `newgcd1` is 1; `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `a` is a list of integers where `a[i-1]` represents the number written on vertex `i`; `parent` is a list of integers where `parent[i-1]` represents the parent of vertex `i` in the tree; `gcdinfo` is a list of GCDInfo objects, where `gcdinfo[i-1]` corresponds to vertex `i`; `visited` is a boolean list indicating whether vertex `i` has been visited; `graph` is a list of lists where `graph[i]` contains the neighbors of vertex `i`; and `newgcd2` is 1.**
