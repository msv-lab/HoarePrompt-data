Functionality: **The function `func_2` processes a tree structure represented by `n` (number of vertices), `parent` (parent pointers), `gcdinfo` (GCD information for each vertex), `a` (values associated with each vertex), and `graph` (adjacency list). It traverses the tree using depth-first search (DFS) and updates the `gcdinfo` list for each vertex based on the values and GCD calculations involving its children and parent. Specifically, for each vertex `n`, it checks if it has been visited, updates its visited status, and calculates the GCD of its value with the GCD of its parent. Depending on the result, it updates the `gcdinfo` list with relevant values. It also recursively processes each neighbor of the current vertex.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If a vertex has no parent (i.e., `parent[n] == -1`), the function still updates its `gcdinfo` based on its own value and the GCD calculation.
- The function assumes that `visited` is initialized to `False` for all vertices before calling `func_2`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no explicit handling for when a vertex has no children. In such cases, the function still updates its `gcdinfo` and proceeds to process its neighbors, which might lead to redundant or unnecessary computations if there are no further children to process.
- The function does not provide any mechanism to handle circular references or non-tree structures, although the provided code assumes a valid tree structure.
- The function does not return any value, which might be misleading given the detailed updates it performs. However, these updates are reflected in the `gcdinfo` list, which is likely passed back to the caller for further processing.
