The function `func_2` processes a tree structure represented by `n` (number of vertices), `parent` (parent pointers), `gcdinfo` (GCD information for each vertex), `a` (values associated with each vertex), and `graph` (adjacency list). It traverses the tree using depth-first search (DFS) and updates the `gcdinfo` list for each vertex based on the values and GCD calculations involving its children and parent. Specifically, for each vertex `n`, it checks if it has been visited, updates its visited status, and calculates the GCD of its value with the GCD of its parent. Depending on the result, it updates the `gcdinfo` list with relevant values. It also recursively processes each neighbor of the current vertex.
