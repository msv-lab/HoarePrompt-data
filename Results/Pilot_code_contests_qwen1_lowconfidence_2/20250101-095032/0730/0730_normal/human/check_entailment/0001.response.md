Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string `S` consists entirely of the same character. For example, if `S` is `"LLLL"` or `"RRRR"`, the program should output `N-1` because rotating any segment will not change the fact that all but one person will be happy. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario, leading to incorrect results. Specifically, the function `func_1` and the logic around it do not properly handle this edge case.
