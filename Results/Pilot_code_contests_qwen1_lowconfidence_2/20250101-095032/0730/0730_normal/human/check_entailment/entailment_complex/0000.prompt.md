You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N people standing in a queue from west to east.

Given is a string S of length N representing the directions of the people. The i-th person from the west is facing west if the i-th character of S is `L`, and east if that character of S is `R`.

A person is happy if the person in front of him/her is facing the same direction. If no person is standing in front of a person, however, he/she is not happy.

You can perform the following operation any number of times between 0 and K (inclusive):

Operation: Choose integers l and r such that 1 \leq l \leq r \leq N, and rotate by 180 degrees the part of the queue: the l-th, (l+1)-th, ..., r-th persons. That is, for each i = 0, 1, ..., r-l, the (l + i)-th person from the west will stand the (r - i)-th from the west after the operation, facing east if he/she is facing west now, and vice versa.

What is the maximum possible number of happy people you can have?

Constraints

* N is an integer satisfying 1 \leq N \leq 10^5.
* K is an integer satisfying 1 \leq K \leq 10^5.
* |S| = N
* Each character of S is `L` or `R`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
S


Output

Print the maximum possible number of happy people after at most K operations.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

input = raw_input
(N, K) = map(int, input().split(' '))
S = list(input())
if S == 'RL':
    print(0)
    exit()
if S == 'LR':
    print(0)
    exit()
if S == 'RLR' or S == 'LRL':
    if K == 1:
        print(1)
        exit()
    else:
        print(2)
        exit()
s = func_1(S)
k = 0
lr = 0
rl = 0
for i in range(N - 1):
    if S[i] == 'L' and S[i + 1] == 'R':
        lr += 1
    if S[i] == 'R' and S[i + 1] == 'L':
        rl += 1
lrl = 0
rlr = 0
for i in range(N - 2):
    if S[i] == 'L' and S[i + 1] == 'R' and (S[i + 2] == 'L'):
        lrl += 1
    if S[i] == 'R' and S[i + 1] == 'L' and (S[i + 2] == 'R'):
        rlr += 1
if lrl == 1 and rl == 1 and (lr == 1) or (rlr == 1 and rl == 1 and (lr == 1)):
    if K >= 2:
        print(s + 2)
        exit()
    elif K == 1:
        print(s + 1)
        exit()
    else:
        print(s)
        exit()
c = min(K, lr, rl)
s += 2 * c
if K > min(lr, rl):
    if S[0] == 'L' and rl > lr:
        s += 1
    elif S[-1] == 'R' and rl < lr:
        s += 1
print(s)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length N consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', and 1 <= N <= 10^5. Additionally, K is an integer such that 1 <= K <= 10^5.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L' and i >= 1 and s[i - 1] == 'L':
            ans += 1
        elif s[i] == 'R' and i <= n - 2 and s[i + 1] == 'R':
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `n` is `N`, `ans` is the count of consecutive 'LL' substrings and consecutive 'RR' substrings in `s`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the count of consecutive 'LL' and 'RR' substrings in string `s`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and returns the count of consecutive 'LL' and 'RR' substrings in `s`. It iterates through the string `s` and increments the counter `ans` whenever it finds two consecutive 'L' or two consecutive 'R'. The function handles edge cases where the string might start or end with 'L' or 'R' without causing out-of-range errors by ensuring the indices used for checking consecutive characters are within bounds.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
