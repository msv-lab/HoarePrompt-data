The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and returns the count of consecutive 'LL' and 'RR' substrings in `s`. It iterates through the string `s` and increments the counter `ans` whenever it finds two consecutive 'L' or two consecutive 'R'. The function handles edge cases where the string might start or end with 'L' or 'R' without causing out-of-range errors by ensuring the indices used for checking consecutive characters are within bounds.
