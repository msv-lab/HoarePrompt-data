`ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `previous_i`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is its value from the previous iteration plus 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is its value after the previous iteration + 1, `i` is previous_i + 1, and previous_i + 1 must be less than `n`.**
