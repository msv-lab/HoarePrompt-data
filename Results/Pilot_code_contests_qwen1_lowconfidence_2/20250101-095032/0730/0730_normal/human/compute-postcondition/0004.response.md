The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `ans` was initially 0, so now `ans` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length N consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 1, the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the character at index `i-1` in `s` is 'L', and the character at index `i` in `s` is 'L'**
