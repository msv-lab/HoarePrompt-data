Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is its value after the previous iteration, `i` is previous_i + 1, and previous_i + 1 must be less than `n`. If `s[i]` is 'L' and `i - 1` is within bounds and `s[i - 1]` is 'L', then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is 'R' and `i` is less than or equal to `n - 2` and `s[i + 1]` is 'R', then `ans` is also incremented by 1. In all other cases, `ans` remains unchanged.***
