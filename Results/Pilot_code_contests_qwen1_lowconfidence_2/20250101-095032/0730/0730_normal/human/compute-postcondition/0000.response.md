The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', and 1 <= N <= 10^5. After executing the code, the length of `s` is stored in `n`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'; `n` is `N`.**
