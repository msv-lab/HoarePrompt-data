The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially 0, it now becomes 1. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged because the code only modifies `ans`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 1, and either `s[i]` is not 'L', `i` is less than 1, or `s[i-1]` is not 'L'. Additionally, at the entry of the if condition, `s[i]` is 'R', `i` is less than or equal to `n - 2`, and `s[i + 1]` is 'R'.**
