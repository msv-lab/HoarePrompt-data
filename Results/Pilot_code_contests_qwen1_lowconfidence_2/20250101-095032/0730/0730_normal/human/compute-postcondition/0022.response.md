The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length N consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The length of the string satisfies the condition 1 <= N <= 10^5. Additionally, an integer `K` is provided such that 1 <= K <= 10^5, although `K` itself is not used in the described functionality. The function counts the number of consecutive 'LL' and 'RR' substrings in string `s` and returns this count as `ans`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R', and returns the count of consecutive 'LL' and 'RR' substrings in `s`.**
