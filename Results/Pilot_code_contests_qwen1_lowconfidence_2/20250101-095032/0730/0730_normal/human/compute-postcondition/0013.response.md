Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` + 1, and `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1. This holds true if and only if `s[i]` is 'R', `i` is less than or equal to `n - 2`, and `s[i + 1]` is also 'R'. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.***
