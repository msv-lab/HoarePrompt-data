The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial state shows that `ans` is its value after the previous iteration, `i` is previous_i + 1, and previous_i + 1 must be less than `n`. After executing the code, the value of `ans` is updated to its previous value plus 1. The conditions on `i` and the requirement that `i` is less than `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is its value after the previous iteration plus 1, `i` is previous_i + 1, and previous_i + 1 must be less than `n`**
