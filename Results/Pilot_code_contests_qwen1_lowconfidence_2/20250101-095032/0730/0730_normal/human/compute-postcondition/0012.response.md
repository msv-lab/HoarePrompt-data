`ans` is incremented by 1, and `i` is increased by 1 from its previous state. The initial conditions that `s` is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `n` is greater than 0, and `ans` remains the same as the previous iteration are still valid. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus 1.
- `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` + 1, `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1**
