Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `n` is greater than 0, and `ans` is 1 if the following conditions are met:
1. The character at index `i` in `s` is 'L' and the character at index `i-1` in `s` is 'L'.
2. If the character at index `i` in `s` is 'R', then `i` is less than or equal to `n - 2` and the character at index `i + 1` in `s` is 'R'.
Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
