    #The program returns ans which is the sum of (lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2 for all valid indices i where lmn[i] < lmx[i]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `a`, where each tuple represents the coordinates (x, y) of a black token. It initializes two lists, `lmn` and `lmx`, both of size 400010, with specific initial values. It then updates these lists based on the coordinates in `a`. Specifically, for each coordinate (x, y) in `a`, `lmn[x]` is updated to be the minimum value of `y` among all coordinates (x, y) in `a` such that `lmn[x] > y`, and `lmx[x]` is updated to be the maximum value of `y` among all coordinates (x, y) in `a` such that `lmx[x] < y`.

After these initial updates, the function further processes the lists `lmn` and `lmx` through several loops:
1. It ensures that `lmn` is non-decreasing up to index 200009 and non-increasing from index 200009 to 400009.
2. It ensures that `lmx` is non-increasing up to index 200009 and non-decreasing from index 200009 to 400009.
3. It then updates `lmn` and `lmx` using a reference copy `rmn` and `rmx` to ensure that `lmn[i]` is the maximum value between itself and the corresponding value in `rmn[i]`, and similarly for `lmx`.

Finally, the function calculates and returns `ans`, which is the sum of `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` for all valid indices `i` where `lmn[i] < lmx[i]`. This sum represents the total "distance" between the maximum and minimum values of `y` for each `x` coordinate, considering the constraints and updates performed on `lmn` and `lmx`.

Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input list `a` might be empty or contain only one element, in which case the initial conditions of `lmn` and `lmx` would directly apply without any updates. Additionally, if no valid indices `i` exist where `lmn[i] < lmx[i]`, the function will return 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of black points, and dat is an iterator containing 2 * n integers representing the x and y coordinates of the black points. The coordinates are read from standard input using `stdin.readline()` and `stdin.read().split()`. The function `func_1` is assumed to process the data in the `s` list and return an integer value.
def func_2():
    n = int(stdin.readline())
    dat = map(int, stdin.read().split(), repeat(10, 2 * n))
    s = [[], []]
    for i in xrange(n):
        x, y = dat[i * 2:i * 2 + 2]

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer read from standard input, `dat` is an iterator containing \(2 \times n\) integers, `s` is a list of two lists, where one sublist contains tuples \((-x + y, x + y)\) for even sums and the other sublist contains tuples for odd sums.
    print(func_1(s[0]) + func_1(s[1]))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` from standard input, followed by `2 * n` integers representing the coordinates of `n` black points. It then processes these coordinates into two lists based on the parity of their sum, where each tuple in the list contains `(-x + y, x + y)`. After processing, it calls `func_1` on both lists and prints the sum of the results. Potential edge cases include invalid input (e.g., non-integer values for `n` or coordinates) which would result in undefined behavior due to the nature of the `int` conversion and list slicing operations. There is also no validation for the coordinates being valid (e.g., non-negative values).
