Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the number of valid starting positions for the white token, but it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic Flaws**:
   - The function incorrectly assumes that the valid positions can be determined by simple comparisons of y-coordinates within quadrants. This approach does not account for the strategic movements allowed by the black player, which can create complex scenarios.
   - The function does not properly handle the fact that the black player can move each token independently, which can lead to situations where the white token can be blocked in optimal play.

2. **Output Hints Confirmation**:
   - The output hints confirm that the function reads coordinates and processes them into lists based on the parity of their sum. However, this processing alone does not solve the problem, and the subsequent logic in `func_1` does not accurately determine the number of valid starting positions.
   - The output hints also indicate that there are potential edge cases, such as invalid input, which could lead to undefined behavior, but this does not negate the primary logical flaw in the implementation.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic and hence produces incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program remains **False**.
