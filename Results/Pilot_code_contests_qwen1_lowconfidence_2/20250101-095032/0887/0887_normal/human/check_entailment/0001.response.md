Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not accurately calculate the number of valid starting positions for the white token that result in a win for the black player. 

To illustrate this, consider the third example provided in the problem description:

### Input
```
16
2 1
1 2
-1 1
0 1
0 0
1 1
2 -1
2 0
1 0
-1 -1
1 -1
2 2
0 -1
-1 0
0 2
-1 2
```

### Expected Output
```
4
```

However, the given program does not produce the correct output. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to calculate the number of valid starting positions for the white token by dividing the plane into quadrants and calculating the minimum and maximum y-coordinates within each quadrant. However, the logic for determining the valid positions is flawed.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The function incorrectly assumes that the valid positions can be determined by simple comparisons of y-coordinates within quadrants. This approach does not account for the strategic movements allowed by the black player.
   - The function does not properly handle the fact that the black player can move each token independently, which can create complex scenarios that the current logic cannot accurately capture.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the given input, the correct answer is 4 because the white token can only start in specific positions that ensure the black player can always block the white token after 10100500 moves.
   - The provided function fails to identify these specific positions correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic and hence produces incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
