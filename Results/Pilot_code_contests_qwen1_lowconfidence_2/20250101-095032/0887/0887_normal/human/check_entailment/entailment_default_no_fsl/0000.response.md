Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the movement constraints properly and does not account for the optimal strategy of the players.

1. **Movement Constraints**: The problem states that after each move of the white player, the white token cannot be in the same position as any black token. However, the code does not enforce this constraint. Instead, it only processes the coordinates of the black tokens and does not simulate the actual movements of the tokens.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The code simply processes the coordinates and computes a value without simulating the game. It does not consider the turns of the players or the optimal strategy to determine the winning condition.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
-2 0
-1 1
0 -2
1 -1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

However, the provided code will not produce the correct output because it does not simulate the game or enforce the movement constraints.

The correct approach would involve simulating the game turns and checking the positions of the tokens after each move to ensure the white token does not land on any black token. Since the provided code does not simulate the game or enforce the movement constraints, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
