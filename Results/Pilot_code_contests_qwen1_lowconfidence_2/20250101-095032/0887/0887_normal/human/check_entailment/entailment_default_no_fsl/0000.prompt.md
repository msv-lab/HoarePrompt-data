You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Consider the following game for two players. There is one white token and some number of black tokens. Each token is placed on a plane in a point with integer coordinates x and y.

The players take turn making moves, white starts. On each turn, a player moves all tokens of their color by 1 to up, down, left or right. Black player can choose directions for each token independently.

After a turn of the white player the white token can not be in a point where a black token is located. There are no other constraints on locations of the tokens: positions of black tokens can coincide, after a turn of the black player and initially the white token can be in the same point with some black point. If at some moment the white player can't make a move, he loses. If the white player makes 10100500 moves, he wins.

You are to solve the following problem. You are given initial positions of all black tokens. It is guaranteed that initially all these positions are distinct. In how many places can the white token be located initially so that if both players play optimally, the black player wins?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of black points.

The (i + 1)-th line contains two integers xi, yi ( - 105 ≤ xi, yi, ≤ 105) — the coordinates of the point where the i-th black token is initially located.

It is guaranteed that initial positions of black tokens are distinct.

Output

Print the number of points where the white token can be located initially, such that if both players play optimally, the black player wins.

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `a`, where each tuple represents the coordinates (x, y) of a black token. It initializes two lists, `lmn` and `lmx`, both of size 400010, with specific initial values. It then updates these lists based on the coordinates in `a`. Specifically, for each coordinate (x, y) in `a`, `lmn[x]` is updated to be the minimum value of `y` among all coordinates (x, y) in `a` such that `lmn[x] > y`, and `lmx[x]` is updated to be the maximum value of `y` among all coordinates (x, y) in `a` such that `lmx[x] < y`.

After these initial updates, the function further processes the lists `lmn` and `lmx` through several loops:
1. It ensures that `lmn` is non-decreasing up to index 200009 and non-increasing from index 200009 to 400009.
2. It ensures that `lmx` is non-increasing up to index 200009 and non-decreasing from index 200009 to 400009.
3. It then updates `lmn` and `lmx` using a reference copy `rmn` and `rmx` to ensure that `lmn[i]` is the maximum value between itself and the corresponding value in `rmn[i]`, and similarly for `lmx`.

Finally, the function calculates and returns `ans`, which is the sum of `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` for all valid indices `i` where `lmn[i] < lmx[i]`. This sum represents the total "distance" between the maximum and minimum values of `y` for each `x` coordinate, considering the constraints and updates performed on `lmn` and `lmx`.

Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input list `a` might be empty or contain only one element, in which case the initial conditions of `lmn` and `lmx` would directly apply without any updates. Additionally, if no valid indices `i` exist where `lmn[i] < lmx[i]`, the function will return 0.

    dat = map(int, stdin.read().split(), repeat(10, 2 * n))
    s = [[], []]
    for i in xrange(n):
        (x, y) = dat[i * 2:i * 2 + 2]
        s[x + y & 1].append((-x + y, x + y))
    print(func_1(s[0]) + func_1(s[1]))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads an integer `n` from standard input, followed by `2 * n` integers representing the coordinates of `n` black points. It then processes these coordinates into two lists based on the parity of their sum, where each tuple in the list contains `(-x + y, x + y)`. After processing, it calls `func_1` on both lists and prints the sum of the results. Potential edge cases include invalid input (e.g., non-integer values for `n` or coordinates) which would result in undefined behavior due to the nature of the `int` conversion and list slicing operations. There is also no validation for the coordinates being valid (e.g., non-negative values).



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
