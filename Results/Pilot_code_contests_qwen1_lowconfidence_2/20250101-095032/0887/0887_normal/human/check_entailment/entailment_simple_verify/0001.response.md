Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not accurately calculate the number of valid starting positions for the white token that result in a win for the black player. 

Here are key points that support the original assessment:

1. **Function `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` does not properly handle the strategic movements allowed by the black player. The function attempts to divide the plane into quadrants and calculate the minimum and maximum y-coordinates within each quadrant, but this approach is too simplistic and does not account for the complex blocking strategies the black player can employ.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Quadrant Logic**: The logic used to update `lmn` and `lmx` is overly simplistic and does not reflect the actual constraints of the problem. For example, the for loops that update `lmn` and `lmx` are not correctly handling the dynamic nature of the problem where the black player can move tokens independently to block the white player.

3. **Annotated Code**: The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` performs operations that do not align with the problem requirements. The operations involving `lmn` and `lmx` do not accurately model the strategic movements and blocking scenarios necessary to determine the valid starting positions for the white token.

Given these points, the annotated version reinforces the original assessment that the program is incorrect. The logic in `func_1` does not correctly implement the necessary strategic considerations for the game, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program's correctness remains **False**.
