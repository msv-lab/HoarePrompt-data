Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not accurately determine the number of initial positions for the white token such that the black player can win if both players play optimally.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Processing of Token Positions**: The code processes the positions of the black tokens and attempts to calculate the possible initial positions for the white token using the `func_1` function. However, the implementation of `func_1` does not correctly reflect the game rules and does not account for the constraints specified in the problem description.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid White Token Positions**: The `func_1` function computes distances between certain points but does not correctly translate these distances into valid initial positions for the white token. The calculations performed in `func_1` do not align with the requirement to determine the number of initial positions where the white token can be placed such that the black player can force a win.

3. **Lack of Optimal Strategy Handling**: The code does not implement an optimal strategy for the black player to ensure a win. The black player needs to block all possible moves of the white token, which requires a more sophisticated approach than what is implemented.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
4
-2 -1
0 1
0 -3
2 -1
```
The expected output, as shown in the problem statement, is `4`. However, the provided code does not produce this result. The implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` does not correctly handle the game logic and fails to determine the correct number of initial positions for the white token.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality and hence the correctness is **False**.
