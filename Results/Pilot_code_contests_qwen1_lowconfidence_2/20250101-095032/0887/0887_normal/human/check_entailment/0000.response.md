Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the number of valid initial positions for the white token using a complex algorithm involving minimum and maximum values across a large range of indices. However, this approach does not accurately model the game rules and constraints.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following scenario:

### Counterexample:

For the input:
```
4
-2 0
-1 1
0 -2
1 -1
```

According to the problem description, we need to determine the number of initial positions for the white token such that the black player can always force a win. This means that the white token cannot move to any position where a black token is located after its move.

Let's analyze the positions step-by-step:

1. Initially, the black tokens are at (-2, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -2), and (1, -1).
2. The white token needs to avoid landing on any of these positions after its move.
3. For the white token to lose, it must be forced into a position where it cannot make a valid move without colliding with a black token.

However, the program's logic does not correctly account for the optimal strategy of the black player to block all possible moves of the white token. Instead, it seems to focus on calculating some intermediate values without considering the strategic aspects of the game.

Given the complexity of the game and the need to ensure that the black player can always force a win, the provided solution fails to correctly implement the necessary logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
