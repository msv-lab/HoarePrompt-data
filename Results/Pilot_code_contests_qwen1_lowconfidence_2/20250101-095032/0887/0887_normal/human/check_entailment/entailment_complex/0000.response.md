Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the game rules and the objective as described in the problem. Specifically, the code does not account for the movement constraints and the winning conditions properly.

1. **Movement Constraints**: The problem specifies that the white token cannot be in a position where a black token is located after the white player's move. However, the code does not enforce this constraint. Instead, it seems to focus on calculating a distance-like measure based on the initial positions of the black tokens.

2. **Winning Condition**: The problem states that the black player wins if they force the white player to run out of valid moves within 10^100500 moves. The code does not implement this logic. Instead, it computes a sum of distances which does not align with the winning condition.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle cases where the initial positions of the black tokens might form configurations that allow the white player to always have a valid move. For example, if all black tokens are aligned in such a way that they do not block all possible white moves, the current implementation would still compute a result that does not reflect the game's outcome.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
4
-2 0
-1 1
0 -2
1 -1
```
Based on the problem description, the white player can always make a move as long as there are gaps available. However, the current code computes a sum of distances, which does not reflect the game's outcome correctly.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is **False**.
