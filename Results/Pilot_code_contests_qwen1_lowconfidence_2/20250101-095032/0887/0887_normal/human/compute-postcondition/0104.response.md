Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Analysis

**Loop Code:**
```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    if lmn[i] < lmn[i + 1]:
        lmn[i] = lmn[i + 1]
```

**Initial State:**
- `lmx` is a list of integers.
- `rmx` is a list of integers.
- For all indices `i` where `0 <= i < 200010`, if `lmx[i]` was initially greater than `rmx[i]`, then `lmx[i]` will be set to `rmx[i]`. Otherwise, `lmx[i]` remains unchanged.
- `ans` is 0.

### Understanding the Loop Behavior

1. **First Iteration (`i=0`):**
   - Check if `lmn[0] < lmn[1]`.
   - If true, `lmn[0]` is updated to `lmn[1]`.
   - If false, `lmn[0]` remains unchanged.

2. **Second Iteration (`i=1`):**
   - Check if `lmn[1] < lmn[2]`.
   - If true, `lmn[1]` is updated to `lmn[2]`.
   - If false, `lmn[1]` remains unchanged.

3. **Third Iteration (`i=2`):**
   - Check if `lmn[2] < lmn[3]`.
   - If true, `lmn[2]` is updated to `lmn[3]`.
   - If false, `lmn[2]` remains unchanged.

This pattern continues until `i = 200007`.

### Final State Analysis

- **Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
  - The loop will execute as long as there is at least one pair of elements `(lmn[i], lmn[i+1])` such that `lmn[i] < lmn[i+1]`.
  - Once no more such pairs exist, the loop will stop.

- **Final Value of `lmn`:**
  - After all iterations, `lmn[i]` will be the maximum value among `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i+1]` for each `i` from `0` to `200007`.
  - This means that `lmn` will be transformed into a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor.

- **Values of Other Variables:**
  - `lmx` and `rmx` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise in the problem statement.
  - `ans` remains `0` because the loop does not modify `ans`.

### Output State

Given the analysis above, the final state of the variables after the loop has executed is as follows:

Output State: **`lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` and `rmx` are lists of integers initialized as per the problem statement, and `ans` is 0.**
