The code updates the value of `lmx[i + 1]` to be equal to `lmx[i]`. Given the initial state, the value of `lmx[i]` is `-1001001001`. Therefore, `lmx[i + 1]` will also be set to `-1001001001`.

- The value of `i` remains `200008`.
- The value of `lmn` remains unchanged, being a list of 400010 elements each initialized to `1001001001`.
- The value of `rmn` remains unchanged, being a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- The value of `rmx` remains unchanged, being a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- The current value of `lmx[i + 1]` was less than the current value of `lmx[i]`, but now both `lmx[i]` and `lmx[i + 1]` are equal to `-1001001001`, making this condition no longer true.

Output State: **`i` is 200008; `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001; `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` is -1001001001 and all other elements are -1001001001; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`**
