Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Initial Loop Conditions**: The loop is defined as `for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):`. This means the loop starts from `200008` (since `xrange(200009, 0, -1)` starts at `200008` and goes down to `1`) and decrements `i` by `1` until it reaches `0`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is currently `200007`.
   - `rmx[200006]` is compared to `rmx[200007]`, and if `rmx[200006]` is less than `rmx[200007]`, the condition holds true.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must decrease by `1` from `200007` to `200006`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `200006`.

4. **Condition Check for Next Iteration**:
   - The condition checks if `rmx[200005]` is less than `rmx[200006]` for the next iteration.
   - Since `rmx[200006]` remains unchanged, the condition will depend on the value of `rmx[200005]`.

5. **Adjusted States**:
   - `i` will be `200006`.
   - `rmx[200006]` remains unchanged.
   - The condition for the next iteration will check if `rmx[200005]` is less than `rmx[200006]`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 200006, `rmx[200006]` remains unchanged, and the condition checks if `rmx[200005]` is less than `rmx[200006]`**.
