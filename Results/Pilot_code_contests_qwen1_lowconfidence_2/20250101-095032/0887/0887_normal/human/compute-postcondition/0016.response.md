`lmx[x]` is assigned the value `y`. According to the initial state, `lmn[x]` is updated to `y` and `lmx[x]` is less than `y` if it was checked. This means before the current line of code, `lmx[x]` was already less than `y` (if the condition was true), or it was not checked (if the condition was false). Regardless of the if condition outcome, the postcondition does not change. Since the code simply assigns `y` to `lmx[x]`, the postcondition implies that `lmx[x]` will remain less than `y`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` contains at least one tuple, `x` is equal to `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`, `lmn[x]` is updated to `y`, `lmx[x]` is equal to `y`**, and the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition outcome.
