The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it processes data read from standard input using `stdin.readline()` and `stdin.read().split()`, where `dat` is an iterator containing 2 * n integers representing the x and y coordinates of the black points. Additionally, `n` is an integer representing the number of black points, and `func_1` is assumed to process the data in the `s` list and return an integer value.

Based on the given information, the functionality of the function `func_2` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function reads `n` (an integer) and `dat` (an iterator containing 2 * n integers representing coordinates), calls `func_1` with the processed data, and returns an integer value.**
