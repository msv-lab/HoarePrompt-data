Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer read from standard input.
   - `dat` is an iterator containing \(2 \times n\) integers.
   - `s` is a list of lists, where one of the lists contains the tuple `(-x + y, x + y)`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is `dat[0]`.
   - `y` is `dat[1]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range `xrange(n)`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. Therefore, the current value of `i` should be \(1 + 1 = 2\).

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Updating States:**
   - Since `i` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `x` and `y` remain the same as they are derived from the first two elements of the `dat` iterator, which do not change within the loop.

6. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` must be 3.
   - `x` remains the same, so `x` is still `dat[0]`.
   - `y` remains the same, so `y` is still `dat[1]`.

7. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue if `i < n`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input, `dat` is an iterator containing \(2 \times n\) integers, `s` is [[...], [...]], where one of the lists contains the tuple `(-x + y, x + y)`, `i` is 3, `x` is `dat[0]`, `y` is `dat[1]`**.
