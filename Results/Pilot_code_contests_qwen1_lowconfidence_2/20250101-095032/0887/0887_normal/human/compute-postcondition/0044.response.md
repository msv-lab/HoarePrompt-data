Postcondition: ***`i` is 200009, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` is -1001001001 and `lmx[200010]` is either -1001001001 or a different value (depending on the if condition), `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`. If `lmx[i + 1] < lmx[i]`, then `lmx[200010]` is -1001001001. Otherwise, `lmx[200010]` remains unchanged.***
