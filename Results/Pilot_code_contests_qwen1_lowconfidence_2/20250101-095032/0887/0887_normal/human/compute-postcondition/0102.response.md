The code snippet `lmn[i] = lmn[i + 1]` updates the value of `lmn[i]` to be the same as `lmn[i + 1]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, this means `lmn[2]` is being set to the value of `lmn[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2; `lmn[2]` is equal to `lmn[3]`; `rmx` and `ans` are in their initial states**
