`lmx[x]` is assigned the value of `y`. From the initial state, we know that `x` is \((x - 1) / 2 + 100005\) and `y` is the second element of the next tuple in `a`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state will be:

- `a` contains at least one tuple,
- `x` is \((x - 1) / 2 + 100005\),
- `y` is the second element of the next tuple in `a`,
- `lmx[x]` is assigned the value of `y`.

Output State: **`a` contains at least one tuple, `x` is \((x - 1) / 2 + 100005\), `y` is the second element of the next tuple in `a`, `lmx[x]` is assigned the value of `y`.**
