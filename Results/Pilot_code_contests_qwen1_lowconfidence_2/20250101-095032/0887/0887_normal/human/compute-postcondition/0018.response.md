According to the code, the loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `a` contains at least one tuple.
- `x` is equal to `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`.
- `lmn[x]` is updated to `y`.
- `lmx[x]` is equal to `y`.

Regardless of the if condition outcome, these conditions hold true.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following needs to be true at the start of the next iteration:

1. `a` must still contain at least one tuple. If there are no more tuples left in `a`, the loop will terminate.
2. The value of `x` and `y` will change based on the next tuple in `a`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The list `a` must still have at least one tuple remaining for the loop to continue.
2. The variable `x` will be set to the first element of the next tuple in `a`.
3. The variable `y` will be set to the second element of the next tuple in `a`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:

- `a` must contain at least one tuple.
- `x` will be the first element of the next tuple in `a`.
- `y` will be the second element of the next tuple in `a`.

Since `lmn[x]` and `lmx[x]` are updated based on the current tuple `(x, y)`, these values will be updated accordingly, but they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`a` contains at least one tuple, `x` is the first element of the next tuple in `a`, `y` is the second element of the next tuple in `a`**
