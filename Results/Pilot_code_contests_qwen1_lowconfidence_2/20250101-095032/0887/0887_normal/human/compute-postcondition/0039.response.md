Postcondition: **`i` is 200008, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to -1001001001, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, and the current value of `lmx[i + 1]` is less than the current value of `lmx[i]`.**
