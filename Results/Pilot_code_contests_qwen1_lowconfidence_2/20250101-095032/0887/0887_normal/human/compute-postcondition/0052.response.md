Postcondition: ***`i` is 200009, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` to `lmx[400008]` are -1001001001 and `lmx[400009]` is either -1001001001 or a different value, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn` where `rmn[i - 1]` (which is 200008) is now equal to `rmn[i]` (which is 200009), `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`. If `rmn[i - 1]` is greater than `rmn[i]`, `rmn[i - 1]` is set to `rmn[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `rmn` and `rmx` remain unchanged.***
