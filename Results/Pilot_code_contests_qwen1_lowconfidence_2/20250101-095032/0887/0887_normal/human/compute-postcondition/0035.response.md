In the given initial state, the code snippet `lmn[i + 1] = lmn[i]` is executed. This line of code updates the element at index `i + 1` in the list `lmn` to be the same as the element at index `i`. The variable `i` must have a specific integer value for this operation to be valid.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, let's denote it as `k` (where `k` is an integer). Therefore, the operation `lmn[k + 1] = lmn[k]` changes the value of `lmn[k + 1]` to be equal to `lmn[k]`.

Output State: **`lmn[k + 1]` is now equal to `lmn[k]`, all other elements in `lmn` remain unchanged.**
