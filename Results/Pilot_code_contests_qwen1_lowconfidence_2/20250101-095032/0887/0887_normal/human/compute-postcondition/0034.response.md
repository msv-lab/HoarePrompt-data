Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of tuples (not relevant to the loop).
   - `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001 with `lmn[2]` updated to 1001001001.
   - `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to -1001001001.
   - `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
   - `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates from `i` = 1 to `i` = 200009.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - If `lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]`, then `lmx[i]` is updated to `lmn[i + 1]`.
   - Otherwise, the values of `lmx`, `rmn`, `rmx`, and `i` remain unchanged.

4. **Current Value of `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - We need to check if `lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]` to determine if `lmx[i]` needs to be updated.

6. **Check Condition**:
   - At `i = 1`, we need to check `lmn[2] > lmn[1]`.
   - Given that `lmn[2]` is updated to 1001001001 and `lmn[1]` is initialized to 1001001001, the condition `lmn[2] > lmn[1]` is false.
   - Therefore, `lmx[1]` remains unchanged.

7. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the condition is false, `lmx[1]` remains -1001001001.
   - `lmn`, `rmn`, and `rmx` remain unchanged as no other updates were made.
   - `i` is now 2.

**Final State**:
- `a` is a list of tuples (unchanged).
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001 with `lmn[2]` updated to 1001001001.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[1]` is -1001001001 and the rest are unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is 2.

**State:**
**`a` is a list of tuples, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001 with `lmn[2]` updated to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[1]` is -1001001001 and the rest are unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 2.**
