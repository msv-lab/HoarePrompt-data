`lmn[i + 1]` is assigned the value of `lmn[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `lmn[i + 1]` corresponds to `lmn[2]` (since indexing starts from 0). Initially, `lmn[2]` is 1001001001. After the assignment, `lmn[2]` becomes 1001001001. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001 with `lmn[2]` updated to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to -1001001001, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 1**
