Postcondition: ***`i` is 200010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` is -1001001001 and `lmx[200010]` is -1001001001, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`. If `lmx[200011]` is -1001001001, the condition `lmx[i + 1] < lmx[i]` is true, and no changes are made to `lmx` or `rmx`. If `lmx[200011]` is different from -1001001001, the condition `lmx[i + 1] < lmx[i]` is false, and no changes are made to `lmx` or `rmx`.***
