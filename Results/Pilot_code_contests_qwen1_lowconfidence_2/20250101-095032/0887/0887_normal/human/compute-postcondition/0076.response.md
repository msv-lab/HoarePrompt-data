The code `lmn[i] = rmn[i]` assigns the value of `rmn[i]` to `lmn[i]`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `lmn` and `rmn`, we only know that `i` is 1 and `n` is 200010. After executing the code, the value of `lmn[1]` will be updated to `rmn[1]`, but the specific value of `rmn[1]` is not given.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is 200010; `lmn[1]` is `rmn[1]`**
