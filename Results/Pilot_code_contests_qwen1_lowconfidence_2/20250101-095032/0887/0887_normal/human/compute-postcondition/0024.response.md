Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (x, y) representing the coordinates of a black token; `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to 1001001001; `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to -1001001001; for every tuple (x, y) in `a`, `lmn[x]` is the maximum value of `y` for all tuples (x, y) in `a` such that `lmn[x] > y`; for every tuple (x, y) in `a`, `lmx[x]` is the minimum value of `y` for all tuples (x, y) in `a` such that `lmx[x] < y`.**
