The code snippet sets the value of `lmx[i]` to the value of `rmx[i]`. This means that at index `i`, the value in `lmx` is now equal to the value in `rmx` at the same index, but the condition that `lmx[i]` was originally greater than `rmx[i]` is no longer true.

Output State: **`lmx` is a list of integers, `rmx` is a list of integers; `lmx[i]` is equal to `rmx[i]`**
