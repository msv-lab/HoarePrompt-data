Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( i \) is 200008.
- \( lmn \) is a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to 1001001001.
- \( lmx \) is a list of 400010 elements where \( lmx[200009] \) to \( lmx[400008] \) are -1001001001, and \( lmx[400009] \) is either -1001001001 or a different value.
- \( rmn[200007] \) is 200009.
- \( rmx \) is a shallow copy of \( lmx \).

### For Loop:
```python
for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop iterates from 200009 down to 1 (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, \( i \) is 200008. For the loop to continue, \( i \) must be decremented to 200007.

### Updated States:
- The value of \( i \) decreases by 1, so \( i \) becomes 200007.
- The conditions involving \( lmn \), \( lmx \), \( rmn \), and \( rmx \) remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them. Since the loop body is omitted, these lists and values remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### New State:
State: **`i` is 200007, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` to `lmx[400008]` are -1001001001 and `lmx[400009]` is either -1001001001 or a different value, `rmn[200007]` is 200009, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.**

This ensures that the loop can continue to the next iteration with the updated value of \( i \).
