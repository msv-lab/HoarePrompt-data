The code snippet updates the value of `lmx[i + 1]` to be equal to `lmx[i]`. Given that `i` is 200010, `lmx[i + 1]` refers to `lmx[200011]`. The original value of `lmx[200011]` is 1001001001. After executing the code, `lmx[200011]` will be updated to the value of `lmx[200010]`, which is -1001001001.

The states of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 200010; `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001; `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` is -1001001001 and `lmx[200010]` is -1001001001, `lmx[200011]` is -1001001001; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.**
