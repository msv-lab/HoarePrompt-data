The code updates the value of `x` to \((x - 1) / 2 + 100005\). Given that `x` was the first element of the next tuple in `a`, its value is updated according to the formula. The values of `y` and `a` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` contains at least one tuple, `x` is \((x - 1) / 2 + 100005\), `y` is the second element of the next tuple in `a`**
