According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 200009 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` is 0 since no changes were made inside the loop body due to the condition `if lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]`. This means that `i` remains unchanged.

Given the condition `if lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]`, no changes are made to `lmn` and `lmx` if this condition is true. Since the condition was not met, `i` stays at 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The lists `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, and the other variables stay the same.

State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to -1001001001, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 1**
