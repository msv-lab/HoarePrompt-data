Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of tuples, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001 with `lmn[2]` updated to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to -1001001001, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 1. If `lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]`, then `lmx[i]` is updated to `lmn[i + 1]`. Otherwise, the values of `lmx`, `rmn`, `rmx`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
