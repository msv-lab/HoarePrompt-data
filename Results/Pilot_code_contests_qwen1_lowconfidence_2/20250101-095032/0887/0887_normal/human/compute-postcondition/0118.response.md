`ans` is incremented by half the difference between `lmx[i]` and `lmn[i]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` is a list where each element `lmx[i]` is not greater than `lmx[i + 1]` for all valid indices, `rmx` is a list of integers, and `ans` is `ans` plus half the difference between `lmx[i]` and `lmn[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` is a list where each element `lmx[i]` is not greater than `lmx[i + 1]` for all valid indices, `rmx` is a list of integers, and `ans` is `ans + (lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2`**
