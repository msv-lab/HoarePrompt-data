Postcondition: ***`i` is 200007, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` to `lmx[400008]` are -1001001001 and `lmx[400009]` is either -1001001001 or a different value, `rmn[200007]` is 200009, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`. If `rmn[i - 1] > rmn[i]`, `rmn[200006]` remains 200009. Otherwise, no change occurs in the state of the variables.***
