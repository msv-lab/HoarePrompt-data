Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State:
- \( i \) is set to 1.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to 1001001001.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` to `lmx[400008]` are -1001001001, and `lmx[400009]` is either -1001001001 or a different value.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
    if rmx[i - 1] < rmx[i]:
        rmx[i - 1] = rmx[i]
```

### Analysis of Loop Iterations:
1. **First Iteration (i = 200009):**
   - Compare `rmx[200008]` and `rmx[200009]`.
   - Since both are -1001001001, `rmx[200008]` remains unchanged.

2. **Second Iteration (i = 200008):**
   - Compare `rmx[200007]` and `rmx[200008]`.
   - Both are -1001001001, so `rmx[200007]` remains unchanged.

3. **Third Iteration (i = 200007):**
   - Compare `rmx[200006]` and `rmx[200007]`.
   - Both are -1001001001, so `rmx[200006]` remains unchanged.

4. **General Iteration (i = k):**
   - For any \( k \) in the range from 200008 down to 1:
     - Compare `rmx[k-1]` and `rmx[k]`.
     - Both are -1001001001, so `rmx[k-1]` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
Since `rmx[200009]` is -1001001001 and every subsequent element in the range `[200008, 400009]` is also -1001001001, the comparison inside the loop will never change these values. Therefore, all elements from `rmx[200008]` to `rmx[400009]` will remain -1001001001.

### Final Output State:
- \( i \) will be 1.
- All elements in `rmx` from index 200008 to 400009 will remain -1001001001.
- The rest of the elements in `rmx` (from index 0 to 200007 and from index 400010 onwards) will remain unchanged, which means they will still be 1001001001.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, so it will still contain 1001001001 for all its elements.
- `lmn` and `lmx` retain their original values as described in the initial state.

**Output State:**
- `i` is 1,
- `rmx` is a list of 400010 elements, where `rmx[200008]` to `rmx[400009]` are -1001001001, and all other elements are 1001001001,
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, containing 1001001001 for all its elements,
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to 1001001001,
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, where `lmx[200009]` to `lmx[400008]` are -1001001001, and `lmx[400009]` is either -1001001001 or a different value.

**Output State:** **`i` is 1, `rmx` is a list of 400010 elements, where `rmx[200008]` to `rmx[400009]` are -1001001001, and all other elements are 1001001001, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, containing 1001001001 for all its elements, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, where `lmx[200009]` to `lmx[400008]` are -1001001001, and `lmx[400009]` is either -1001001001 or a different value.**
