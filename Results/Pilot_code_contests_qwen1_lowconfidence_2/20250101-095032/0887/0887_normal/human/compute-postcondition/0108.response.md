Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` is a list where `lmx[0]` is greater than `lmx[1]`, `rmx` is a list of integers, and `ans` remains 0. If `lmx[0]` is not greater than `lmx[1]`, then no changes occur to the variables.***
