The code assigns the value of `rmn[i]` to `lmn[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `lmn[2]` is now equal to `rmn[2]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` is 200010, if `lmn[1]` is less than `rmn[1]`, the condition holds true; otherwise, no change is made to the variables, and `lmn[2]` is now equal to `rmn[2]`.
