The code reads an integer `n` from standard input, which represents the number of black points, and assigns this value to the variable `n`. The variable `dat` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, after executing this line of code, the value of `n` is updated to the integer read from standard input, while the state of `dat` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from standard input, and `dat` is an iterator containing 2 * n integers representing the x and y coordinates of the black points.**
