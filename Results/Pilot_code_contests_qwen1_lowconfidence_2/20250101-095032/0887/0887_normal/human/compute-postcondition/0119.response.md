Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` is a list where each element `lmx[0]` is not greater than `lmx[1]`, `rmx` is a list of integers, and `ans` is updated to `ans + (lmx[0] - lmn[0]) / 2` if `lmn[0] < lmx[0]`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
