In the initial state:
- `i` is 200008
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` to `lmx[400008]` are -1001001001 and `lmx[400009]` is either -1001001001 or a different value
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn` where `rmn[200007]` (which is 200008) is now equal to `rmn[200008]` (which is 200009)
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`

The code snippet updates `rmn[i - 1]` to be equal to `rmn[i]`. Since `i` is 200008, `i - 1` is 200007. So, `rmn[200007]` will be updated to 200009.

- `rmn[200007]` was originally 200008, and after the code runs, it is updated to 200009.
- All other elements in `rmn` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment.
- `rmx` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.

Output State: **`i` is 200008, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` to `lmx[400008]` are -1001001001 and `lmx[400009]` is either -1001001001 or a different value, `rmn[200007]` is 200009, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.**
