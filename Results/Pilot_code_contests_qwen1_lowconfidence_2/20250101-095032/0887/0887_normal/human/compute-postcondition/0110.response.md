The code assigns the value of `lmx[i + 1]` to `lmx[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, this means `lmx[1]` is now assigned the value of `lmx[2]`.

The state of the other variables is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` is a list where `lmx[1]` is now equal to `lmx[2]`, `rmx` is a list of integers, and `ans` remains 0**
