To determine the necessary adjustments for the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the initial conditions provided and how they change with each iteration.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is 0
  - `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor
  - `lmx` is a list where each element `lmx[0]` is not greater than `lmx[1]`
  - `rmx` is a list of integers
  - `ans` is updated to `ans + (lmx[0] - lmn[0]) / 2` if `lmn[0] < lmx[0]`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(200009):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is currently 0.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < 200009`.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The other variables (`lmn`, `lmx`, `rmx`, `ans`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

### Conclusion:

Given that no modifications to `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmx`, or `ans` are mentioned in the problem statement, these variables retain their previous values from the end of the last iteration. The only variable that changes is `i`, which increases by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` is a list where each element `lmx[0]` is not greater than `lmx[1]`, `rmx` is a list of integers, and `ans` is updated to `ans + (lmx[0] - lmn[0]) / 2` if `lmn[0] < lmx[0]`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0**
