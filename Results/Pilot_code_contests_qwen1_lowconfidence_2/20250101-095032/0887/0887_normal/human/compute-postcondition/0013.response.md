To solve this, let's break down the given code and analyze its impact step-by-step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer read from standard input.
   - `dat` is an iterator containing \(2 \times n\) integers.
   - `s` is a list of two lists, where:
     - `s[0]` contains tuples \((-x + y, x + y)\) for even sums.
     - `s[1]` contains tuples \((-x + y, x + y)\) for odd sums.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `func_1(s[0]) + func_1(s[1])` is printed.

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - The code does not define `func_1` or modify `n`, `dat`, or `s` in any way.
   - It simply calls `func_1` on `s[0]` and `s[1]` and prints their sum.

Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values it returns, but we know that `func_1` operates on the tuples within `s[0]` and `s[1]`.

4. **Output State:**
   - The values of `n`, `dat`, and `s` remain unchanged.
   - `func_1(s[0]) + func_1(s[1])` is evaluated and printed.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input, `dat` is an iterator containing \(2 \times n\) integers, `s` is a list of two lists where one sublist contains tuples \((-x + y, x + y)\) for even sums and the other sublist contains tuples for odd sums, and the sum of the results of `func_1(s[0])` and `func_1(s[1])` is printed.**
