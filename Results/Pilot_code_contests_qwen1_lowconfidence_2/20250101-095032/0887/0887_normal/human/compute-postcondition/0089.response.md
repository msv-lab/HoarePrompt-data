According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than 200010. At the end of the last iteration, `lmx` and `rmx` are lists of integers, and `i` is less than 200010. Since the condition for the loop to continue (`i < 200010`) still holds true, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be equal to its previous value plus 1, and it will still be less than 200010.

State: **`lmx` is a list of integers, `rmx` is a list of integers, `i` is less than 200010**
