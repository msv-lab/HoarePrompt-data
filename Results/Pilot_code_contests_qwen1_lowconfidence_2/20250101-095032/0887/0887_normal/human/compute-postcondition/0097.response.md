Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `lmx` and `rmx` are lists of integers initialized as per the problem statement, and `ans` is 0. If `lmn[0]` is less than `lmn[1]`, this condition is true and remains unchanged. If `lmn[0]` is equal to `lmn[1]`, then `ans` is set to 0 (unchanged from the initial state).***
