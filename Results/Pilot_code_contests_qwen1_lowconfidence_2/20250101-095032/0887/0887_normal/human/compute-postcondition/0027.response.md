Let's break down the initial state and determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers \((x, y)\) representing the coordinates of a black token.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to 1001001001.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to -1001001001.
- For every tuple \((x, y)\) in `a`, `lmn[x]` is the maximum value of \(y\) for all tuples \((x, y)\) in `a\) such that `lmn[x] > y`.
- For every tuple \((x, y)\) in `a`, `lmx[x]` is the minimum value of \(y\) for all tuples \((x, y)\) in `a\) such that `lmx[x] < y`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.

### Loop Analysis:

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This loop iterates from \(i = 0\) to \(i = 200008\).

### Step-by-Step Determination:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as \(i\) is less than 200009. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop counter `i` starts at 0 and is incremented in such a way that it does not exceed 200008.

2. **Variables Initialization**:
   - The initial values of `lmn` and `lmx` are set to constants. These values will not change during the loop since there is no code in the loop body that modifies these lists.
   - `rmn` and `rmx` are shallow copies of `lmn` and `lmx`, respectively, so they will remain unchanged as well.

3. **Loop Counter `i`**:
   - We need to initialize `i` to 0 and ensure that the loop increments `i` correctly until it reaches 200008.

### Final Adjusted State:

To ensure the loop can execute, the initial state needs to be adjusted to include the correct initialization and loop counter:

State: **`a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (x, y) representing the coordinates of a black token; `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to 1001001001; `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to -1001001001; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`; `i` is 0**

So, the final state should be:

State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to -1001001001, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 0**
