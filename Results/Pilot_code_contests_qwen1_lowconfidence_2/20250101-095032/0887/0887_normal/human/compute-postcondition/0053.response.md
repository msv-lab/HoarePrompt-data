Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step.

### Given States:
- \( i \) is 200009.
- \( lmn \) is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001.
- \( lmx \) is a list of 400010 elements where \( lmx[200009] \) to \( lmx[400008] \) are -1001001001 and \( lmx[400009] \) is either -1001001001 or a different value.
- \( rmn \) is a shallow copy of \( lmn \) where \( rmn[i - 1] \) (which is 200008) is now equal to \( rmn[i] \) (which is 200009).
- \( rmx \) is a shallow copy of \( lmx \).

### For Loop:
```python
for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from 200009 down to 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is \( i > 0 \).

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- At the end of the last iteration, \( i \) is 200009.
- For the loop to execute one more time, \( i \) needs to be decremented by 1, making it 200008.

### Modified States:
- \( i \) is now 200008.
- The conditions on \( lmn \), \( lmx \), \( rmn \), and \( rmx \) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted, and no modifications are specified within the loop body.

### Final State:
- \( i \) is 200008.
- \( lmn \) remains a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001.
- \( lmx \) remains as a list of 400010 elements where \( lmx[200009] \) to \( lmx[400008] \) are -1001001001 and \( lmx[400009] \) is either -1001001001 or a different value.
- \( rmn \) remains a shallow copy of \( lmn \) where \( rmn[i - 1] \) (which is 200008) is now equal to \( rmn[i] \) (which is 200009).
- \( rmx \) remains a shallow copy of \( lmx \).

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 200008, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` to `lmx[400008]` are -1001001001 and `lmx[400009]` is either -1001001001 or a different value, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn` where `rmn[200007]` (which is 200008) is now equal to `rmn[200008]` (which is 200009), `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.**
