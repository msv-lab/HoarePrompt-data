Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor
   - `lmx` is a list where each element `lmx[0]` is not greater than `lmx[1]`
   - `rmx` is a list of integers
   - `ans` is updated by adding `(lmx[1] - lmn[1]) / 2` to its current value if `lmn[1] < lmx[1]; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(200009):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 200008`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute again when `i` becomes 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is simply the range condition, which is satisfied as long as `i < 200009`.

4. **Modifying the States:**
   - `i` will increment by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - There are no changes to `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmx`, or `ans` mentioned in the for loop condition. Therefore, these lists and the variable `ans` remain unchanged.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `lmn` remains the same
   - `lmx` remains the same
   - `rmx` remains the same
   - `ans` remains the same (no change in the loop body is specified)

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`i` is 2, `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` is a list where each element `lmx[0]` is not greater than `lmx[1]`, `rmx` is a list of integers, and `ans` is updated by adding `(lmx[1] - lmn[1]) / 2` to its current value if `lmn[1] < lmx[1]; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
