Postcondition: **`i` is 200009, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` to `lmx[400008]` are -1001001001 and `lmx[400009]` is either -1001001001 or a different value, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`. The current value of `rmn[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `rmn[i]`**
