According to the code, the loop runs from `i = 200009` to `i = 400010 - 1` because `range(200009)` generates numbers from 0 to 200008. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 200009.

To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to check the condition inside the loop:

- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 400010.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 200009. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 200010. 

The other variables (`lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body. Since no specific changes are mentioned for these variables, they will stay as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be 200010.

State: **`i` is 200010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` is -1001001001 and `lmx[200010]` is either -1001001001 or a different value (depending on the if condition), `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.**
