To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop:

1. **Variables and Initial States:**
   - `a` is a list of tuples (this variable is not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to 1001001001.
   - `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to -1001001001.
   - `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
   - `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
   - `i` is initially set to 200008.
   - For all `i` from 200009 to 400009, `lmn[i]` and `lmx[i]` do not change from their initial values because `lmn[i + 1]` will always be greater than or equal to `lmn[i]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in xrange(200009)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = 200008`.

3. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is initially set to 200008. Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to adjust `i` to start from 0.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < 200009`. Since `i` is currently 200008, the loop will execute one more time when `i` increments to 200009.

5. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is within the range of the loop, i.e., `i` should be between 0 and 200008 inclusive.
   - Given that `i` is currently 200008, after one more increment, `i` will become 200009, and the loop will terminate.

Based on this analysis, the necessary state adjustments are:

- `i` should be between 0 and 200008 inclusive for the loop to execute.
- Given the current value of `i` (200008), the loop will execute one more time.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:

State: **`i` is 200008, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to -1001001001, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, and `i` must be between 0 and 200008 inclusive**.
