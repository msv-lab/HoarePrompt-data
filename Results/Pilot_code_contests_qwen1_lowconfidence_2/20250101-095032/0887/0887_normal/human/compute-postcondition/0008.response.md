Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is defined as follows:
   - `n` is an integer read from standard input.
   - `dat` is an iterator containing \(2 \times n\) integers.
   - `s` is a list of two lists, where one of the lists contains the tuple `(-x + y, x + y)`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `x` is `dat[0]`.
   - `y` is `dat[2]`.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   s[x + y & 1].append((-x + y, x + y))
   ```

3. Let's break down the code:
   - `x + y & 1` performs a bitwise AND operation between the sum of `x` and `y` and the number 1. This operation effectively checks if the sum of `x` and `y` is odd (if the result is 1) or even (if the result is 0).
   - `s[x + y & 1]` accesses the appropriate sublist in `s` based on whether `x + y` is odd or even.
   - The tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` is appended to this sublist.

4. Now let's consider the values:
   - `x` is `dat[0]`.
   - `y` is `dat[2]`.
   - The tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` is already known to be contained in one of the sublists of `s`.

5. After the code is executed:
   - The tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` will be appended to the sublist in `s` that corresponds to the parity (odd or even) of `x + y`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

So, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer read from standard input.
- `dat` is an iterator containing \(2 \times n\) integers.
- `s` is a list of two lists, where one of the lists (the one corresponding to the parity of `x + y`) now contains the tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` in addition to its previous contents.
- `i` is 3.
- `x` is `dat[0]`.
- `y` is `dat[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input, `dat` is an iterator containing \(2 \times n\) integers, `s` is a list of two lists, where one of the lists (the one corresponding to the parity of `x + y`) now contains the tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` in addition to its previous contents, `i` is 3, `x` is `dat[0]`, `y` is `dat[2]`.**
