Output State: **`i` is 1, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` to `lmx[400008]` are -1001001001 and `lmx[400009]` is either -1001001001 or a different value, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: The loop starts from 200009 and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 1.
- **`lmn`**: The list `lmn` is not modified by the loop. It remains a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to 1001001001.
- **`lmx`**: The list `lmx` remains unchanged because the loop only modifies `rmn`, which is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- **`rmn`**: The loop iterates from 200009 to 1. For each iteration, if `rmn[i - 1] > rmn[i]`, `rmn[i - 1]` is updated to `rmn[i]`. However, since `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn` and all elements of `lmn` are initially 1001001001, the comparison `rmn[i - 1] > rmn[i]` will always be false. Therefore, `rmn` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`rmx`**: Since `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx` and `lmx` remains unchanged, `rmx` also remains unchanged.

Thus, after the loop completes, the values of the variables are as described above.
