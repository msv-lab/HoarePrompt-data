According to the given code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 200010. The condition for the loop to continue executing is based on the comparison between `lmn[1]` and `rmn[1]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is 200010. The condition to continue the loop is that `lmn[1]` must be less than `rmn[1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 200010, if `lmn[1]` is less than `rmn[1]`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.**
