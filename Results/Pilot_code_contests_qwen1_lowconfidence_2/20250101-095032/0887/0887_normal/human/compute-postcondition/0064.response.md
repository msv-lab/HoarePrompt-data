Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state of the array `rmx` is not explicitly stated, but we know that at the end of the previous iteration, the comparison `rmx[i - 1]` was made with `rmx[i]`, and if they were equal, `rmx[i]` remained unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `200009` down to `1` (inclusive). Therefore, the current value of `i` at the start of this iteration is `200008`.

3. **Loop Body**: The problem states that the only change happens if `rmx[i - 1]` is equal to `rmx[i]`, and in such a case, `rmx[i]` remains unchanged. There are no other changes to the array `rmx`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must decrease by 1, meaning `i` should be `200007` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **No Change in Array**: Since no other changes occur to the array `rmx` unless the condition `rmx[i - 1] == rmx[i]` is met, the state of the array remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, we can conclude that the state of the array `rmx` does not change, and the only state variable that needs adjustment is `i`, which decreases by 1.

**Final State**:
- The value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `200007`.
- No changes to the array `rmx` are necessary since no other changes were mentioned.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`i` is 200007, `rmx` remains unchanged**.
