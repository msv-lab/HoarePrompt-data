`rmx[i - 1]` is assigned the value of `rmx[i]`. Given that `i` is 200007, `i - 1` is 200006. Therefore, `rmx[200006]` is now equal to the value of `rmx[200007]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `rmx` remains unchanged in all other indices except for index 200006.

Output State: **`i` is 200007; `rmx[200006]` is equal to `rmx[200007]`; `rmx` remains unchanged in all other indices**
