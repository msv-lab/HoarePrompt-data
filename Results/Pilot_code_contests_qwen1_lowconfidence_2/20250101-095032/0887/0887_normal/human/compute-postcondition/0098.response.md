According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 200009. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `lmx` and `rmx` are lists of integers initialized as per the problem statement, and `ans` is 0.

Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `lmx` and `rmx` are lists of integers initialized as per the problem statement, and `ans` is 0**.
