Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state before the for loop starts includes the following:
   - `lmx` is a list of integers.
   - `rmx` is a list of integers.
   - For all indices \(i\) where \(0 \leq i < 200010\), if `lmx[i]` was initially greater than `rmx[i]`, then `lmx[i]` will be set to `rmx[i]`. Otherwise, `lmx[i]` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The for loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 200008`.

3. **What the Loop Does**: Inside the loop, the condition `if lmx[i] > rmx[i]` is checked, and if true, `lmx[i]` is set to `rmx[i]`. The loop body is omitted here but this is crucial for determining the necessary initial state adjustments.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - **Index `i`**: The variable `i` starts at 0 and will increment with each iteration. Therefore, the initial state should include the starting value of `i`.
   - **List `lmx` and `rmx`**: The values in `lmx` and `rmx` will be checked and potentially modified. Since no specific values are given, we cannot assume any particular values, but we know that the lists are initialized as per the problem statement.
   - **Variable `ans`**: This variable is not involved in the loop conditions and remains 0 as stated.

Given the above points, we need to ensure that the loop can start and proceed correctly. Specifically, `i` should start at 0, and the lists `lmx` and `rmx` should be initialized according to their respective conditions.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 0.
- `lmx` and `rmx` are initialized as described (no specific values are given, so they remain as per initialization).
- `ans` is 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `lmx` and `rmx` are lists of integers initialized as per the problem statement, `ans` is 0**
