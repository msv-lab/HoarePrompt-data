Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from standard input, followed by `2 * n` integers representing the coordinates of `n` black points. It then processes these coordinates into two lists based on the parity of their sum, where each tuple in the list contains `(-x + y, x + y)`. After processing, it calls `func_1` on both lists and prints the sum of the results. Potential edge cases include invalid input (e.g., non-integer values for `n` or coordinates) which would result in undefined behavior due to the nature of the `int` conversion and list slicing operations. There is also no validation for the coordinates being valid (e.g., non-negative values).**
