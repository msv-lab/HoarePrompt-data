The code `lmn[i] = lmn[i + 1]` assigns the value of `lmn[i + 1]` to `lmn[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, this means `lmn[1]` is assigned the value of `lmn[2]`. The other variables (`lmx`, `rmx`, and `ans`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `lmn[1]` is equal to `lmn[2]`; `lmx` and `rmx` are lists of integers initialized as per the problem statement; `ans` is 0**
