State: **`i` is 0, `n` is 200010**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in xrange(200010):` is defined such that the variable `i` will iterate from 0 up to but not including 200010.
2. For the loop to execute even once, the initial value of `i` must be within the range specified by `xrange(200010)`.
3. At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to 0, which is the starting point of the range.
4. The variable `n` (which is the upper limit of the range) is given as 200010.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to set `i` to 0 and confirm that `n` is 200010.
