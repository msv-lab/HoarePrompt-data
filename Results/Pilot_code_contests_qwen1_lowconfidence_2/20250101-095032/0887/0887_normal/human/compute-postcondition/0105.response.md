State before the loop starts: `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` and `rmx` are lists of integers initialized as per the problem statement, and `ans` is 0.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop runs from `i` in the range `xrange(200009)`, which means `i` will take values from 0 to 200008 inclusive.
2. For the loop to execute, `i` must be within this range. Specifically, the loop should start with `i = 0` and run up to `i = 200008`.
3. Since the loop is iterating over `i`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
4. The initial state of `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmx`, and `ans` does not affect the loop execution directly, but they must be correctly defined and initialized according to the problem statement.

Based on the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is 0, `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` and `rmx` are lists of integers initialized as per the problem statement, and `ans` is 0**
