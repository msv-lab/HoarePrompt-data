`lmn[i]` is assigned the value of `lmn[i + 1]`. The value of `lmn[i]` was originally less than `lmn[i + 1]`, so after this assignment, `lmn[i]` will be equal to `lmn[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `lmx` and `rmx` are lists of integers initialized as per the problem statement, `ans` is 0, and the current value of `lmn[i]` is equal to the value of `lmn[i + 1]`**
