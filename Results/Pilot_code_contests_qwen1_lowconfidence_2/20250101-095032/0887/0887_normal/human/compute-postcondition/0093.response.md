The code `ans = 0` sets the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `lmx` or `rmx`. Therefore, the only change is that `ans` is now 0.

Output State: **`lmx` is a list of integers, `rmx` is a list of integers, and for all indices `i` where `0 <= i < 200010`, if `lmx[i]` was initially greater than `rmx[i]`, then `lmx[i]` will be set to `rmx[i]`. Otherwise, `lmx[i]` remains unchanged; `ans` is 0**
