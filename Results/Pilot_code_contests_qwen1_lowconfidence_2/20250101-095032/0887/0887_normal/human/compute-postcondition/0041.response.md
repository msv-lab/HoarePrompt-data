Postcondition: ***`i` is 200008, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` is -1001001001 and all other elements are -1001001001, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`. If `lmx[i + 1]` is less than `lmx[i]`, no changes are made to `lmn` and `lmx`. Otherwise, no changes are made to these lists.***
