The code `lmx[i] = lmx[i + 1]` assigns the value of `lmx[i + 1]` to `lmx[i]`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `lmx[i + 1]` is greater than `lmx[i]` since `lmx[i]` was originally greater than `lmx[i + 1]` before the assignment. This means `lmx[i]` will now be equal to `lmx[i + 1]`. 

The other variables remain unchanged: `i` is still 0, `lmn` remains a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `rmx` remains a list of integers, `ans` remains 0, and the condition that the current value of `lmx[i]` is greater than `lmx[i + 1]` no longer holds since they are now equal.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` is a list where `lmx[i]` is equal to `lmx[i + 1]`, `rmx` is a list of integers, `ans` is 0**
