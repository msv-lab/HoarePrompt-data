Postcondition: ***`i` is 200008, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` to `lmx[400008]` are -1001001001 and `lmx[400009]` is either -1001001001 or a different value, `rmn[200007]` is 200009, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`. If `rmn[i - 1] > rmn[i]`, then the condition remains as is. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change based on the else condition.***
