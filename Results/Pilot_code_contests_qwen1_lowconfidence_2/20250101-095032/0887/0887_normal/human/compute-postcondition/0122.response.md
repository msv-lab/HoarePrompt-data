Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` is a list where each element `lmx[0]` is not greater than `lmx[1]`, `rmx` is a list of integers, and `ans` is updated by adding `(lmx[1] - lmn[1]) / 2` to its current value if `lmn[1] < lmx[1]; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
