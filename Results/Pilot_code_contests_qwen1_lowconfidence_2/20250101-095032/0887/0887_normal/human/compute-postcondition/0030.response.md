Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of tuples, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to -1001001001, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 0, and if `lmn[i + 1]` is greater than `lmn[i]`, no changes are made to `lmn` and `lmx`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `lmn` and `lmx` as there is no else part provided.***
