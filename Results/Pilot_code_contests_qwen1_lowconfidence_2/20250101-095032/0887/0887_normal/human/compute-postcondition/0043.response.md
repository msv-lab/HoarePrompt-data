The code updates the value of `lmx[i + 1]` to be equal to `lmx[i]`. Given that `i` is 200009, `lmx[i]` is -1001001001. Therefore, `lmx[200010]` will be updated to -1001001001.

The other variables (`i`, `lmn`, `rmn`, `lmx`, and `rmx`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 200009, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` is -1001001001 and all other elements except `lmx[200010]` are -1001001001, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `lmx[200010]` is -1001001001**.
