According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `n`. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 at each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, which means the loop has already executed 4 times (since `i` starts at 0).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented to 4 for the next iteration. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be 4.

The other states remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop itself or any conditions within the loop body that were not specified.

State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input, `dat` is an iterator containing \(2 \times n\) integers, `s` is a list of two lists, where one of the lists (the one corresponding to the parity of `x + y`) now contains the tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` in addition to its previous contents, `i` is 4, `x` is `dat[0]`, `y` is `dat[2]`.**
