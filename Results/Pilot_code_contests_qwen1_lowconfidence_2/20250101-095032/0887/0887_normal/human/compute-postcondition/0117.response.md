Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` is a list where each element `lmx[i]` is not greater than `lmx[i + 1]` for all valid indices, `rmx` is a list of integers, and `ans` remains 0. The current value of `lmn[i]` is less than `lmx[i]`**
