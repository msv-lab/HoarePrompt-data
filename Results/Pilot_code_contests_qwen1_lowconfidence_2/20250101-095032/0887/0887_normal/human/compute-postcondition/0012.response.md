Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Loop Analysis
- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is an integer read from standard input.
  - `dat` is an iterator containing \(2 \times n\) integers.
  - `s` is a list of two lists, both initially empty: `s = [[], []]`.

- **Loop Code**:
  ```python
  for i in range(n):
      x, y = dat[i * 2:i * 2 + 2]
      s[x + y & 1].append((-x + y, x + y))
  ```

### Key Points
1. **Iterator and Tuple Assignment**:
   - For each iteration, `i` ranges from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `x` and `y` are extracted from `dat` as consecutive pairs of integers.
   - The pair \((-x + y, x + y)\) is appended to one of the two sublists in `s` based on the parity of `x + y` (even or odd).

2. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - Since the loop runs `n` times, each element in `dat` will be processed exactly once.
   - Each pair \((-x + y, x + y)\) will be appended to either `s[0]` or `s[1]` depending on whether `x + y` is even or odd.
   - Therefore, `s` will contain two lists: one for the even sums and one for the odd sums.

### Final Output State
After the loop completes all its iterations, the values of the variables will be as follows:
- `n`: The same integer as initially read from standard input.
- `dat`: The same iterator containing \(2 \times n\) integers.
- `s`: A list of two lists, where one sublist contains tuples \((-x + y, x + y)\) for even sums and the other sublist contains tuples for odd sums.

### Output State
Output State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input, `dat` is an iterator containing \(2 \times n\) integers, `s` is a list of two lists, where one sublist contains tuples \((-x + y, x + y)\) for even sums and the other sublist contains tuples for odd sums.**
