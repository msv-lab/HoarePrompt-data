The code updates `rmn[i - 1]` with the value of `rmn[i]`. Given the initial state, where `i` is 200007, `rmn[i]` is 200009. Therefore, `rmn[i - 1]` (which is `rmn[200006]`) will be set to 200009. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 200007, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` to `lmx[400008]` are -1001001001 and `lmx[400009]` is either -1001001001 or a different value, `rmn[200007]` is 200009, `rmn[200006]` is 200009, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.**
