According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from 0 to 200,009. At the end of the previous iteration, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `i` is 0
- `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor
- `lmx` is a list where `lmx[0]` is greater than `lmx[1]`
- `rmx` is a list of integers
- `ans` remains 0

The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than 200,009. Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.

The other variables (`lmn`, `lmx`, `rmx`, and `ans`) do not depend on the loop counter `i` and their values remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body. Since no changes are specified for these variables in the given conditions, they stay the same.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the state will be:
- `i` is 1
- `lmn` remains the same (a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor)
- `lmx` remains the same (a list where `lmx[0]` is greater than `lmx[1]`)
- `rmx` remains the same (a list of integers)
- `ans` remains 0

State: **`i` is 1, `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` is a list where `lmx[0]` is greater than `lmx[1]`, `rmx` is a list of integers, and `ans` remains 0**
