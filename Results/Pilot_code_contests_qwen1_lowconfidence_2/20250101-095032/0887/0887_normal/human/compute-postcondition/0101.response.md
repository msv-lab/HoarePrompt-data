According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 200,008 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.

The variables `lmx` and `rmx` remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted, and the value of `ans` also remains 0 based on the given condition.

State: **`i` is 2, `lmx` and `rmx` are lists of integers initialized as per the problem statement, and `ans` is 0**
