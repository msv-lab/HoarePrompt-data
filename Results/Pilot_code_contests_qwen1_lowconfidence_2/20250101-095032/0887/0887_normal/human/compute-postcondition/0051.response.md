The code `rmn[i - 1] = rmn[i]` updates the value of `rmn[i - 1]` to be equal to the current value of `rmn[i]`. Given that `rmn[i - 1]` was originally greater than `rmn[i]`, this assignment will make `rmn[i - 1]` equal to `rmn[i]`, and therefore no longer greater than `rmn[i]`.

The other variables (`lmn`, `lmx`, `rmx`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The specific value of `rmx[400009]` is not specified in the initial state and does not get updated by the given code.

Output State: **`i` is 200009, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[200009]` to `lmx[400008]` are -1001001001 and `lmx[400009]` is either -1001001001 or a different value, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn` where `rmn[i - 1]` (which is 200008) is now equal to `rmn[i]` (which is 200009), `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.**
