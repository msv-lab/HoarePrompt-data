Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `lmn` is a list where each element is the maximum value among itself and its next neighbor, `lmx` is a list where `lmx[0]` is greater than `lmx[1]` and `lmx[1]` is now equal to `lmx[3]`, `rmx` is a list of integers, and `ans` remains 0. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
