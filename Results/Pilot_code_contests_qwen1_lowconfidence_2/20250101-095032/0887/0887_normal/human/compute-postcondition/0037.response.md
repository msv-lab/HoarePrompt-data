Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to 1001001001, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements each initialized to -1001001001, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200008, and for all `i` from 200009 to 400009, `lmn[i]` and `lmx[i]` do not change from their initial values since `lmn[i + 1]` will always be greater than or equal to `lmn[i]` due to the nature of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 200008`.
- For each iteration, the condition `if lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]:` is checked.
- If `lmn[i + 1]` is greater than `lmn[i]`, then `lmn[i + 1]` is set to `lmn[i]`. This effectively makes `lmn[i + 1]` the same as `lmn[i]`, and this operation propagates down the array.
- Since `lmn[i + 1]` will always be greater than or equal to `lmn[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008, the condition `lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]` will never be true for any `i` from 200009 to 400009. Therefore, the values of `lmn[i]` and `lmx[i]` for these indices remain unchanged.

Thus, after the loop completes, `lmn` remains as initially defined (all elements set to 1001001001), and `lmx` also remains as initially defined (all elements set to -1001001001). The values of `rmn` and `rmx` are also unchanged because they are shallow copies of `lmn` and `lmx`, respectively.
