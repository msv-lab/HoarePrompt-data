The code `rmx = lmx[:]` creates a shallow copy of the list `lmx` and assigns it to the variable `rmx`. This does not change the values of the elements in `lmx` or `rmn`, nor does it change the values of `a`, `lmn`, or `lmx`. It simply creates a new list `rmx` that is a shallow copy of `lmx`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (x, y) representing the coordinates of a black token; `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to 1001001001; `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, each initialized to -1001001001; for every tuple (x, y) in `a`, `lmn[x]` is the maximum value of `y` for all tuples (x, y) in `a` such that `lmn[x] > y`; for every tuple (x, y) in `a`, `lmx[x]` is the minimum value of `y` for all tuples (x, y) in `a` such that `lmx[x] < y`; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`**.
