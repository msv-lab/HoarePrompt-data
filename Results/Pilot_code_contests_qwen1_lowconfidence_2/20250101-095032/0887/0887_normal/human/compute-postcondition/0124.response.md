`ans` is updated by adding half of the difference between `lmx[i]` and `lmn[i]`. Since `i` is initially 2, `lmx[i]` and `lmn[i]` are referenced, but their exact values are not given. However, we know that `i` is now 3 because the loop executes one more time.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is `ans` + (lmx[2] - lmn[2]) / 2**
