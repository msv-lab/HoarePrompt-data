n is an integer representing the number of black points, and dat is an iterator containing 2 * n integers representing the x and y coordinates of the black points. The coordinates are read from standard input using `stdin.readline()` and `stdin.read().split()`. The function `func_1` is assumed to process the data in the `s` list and return an integer value.
