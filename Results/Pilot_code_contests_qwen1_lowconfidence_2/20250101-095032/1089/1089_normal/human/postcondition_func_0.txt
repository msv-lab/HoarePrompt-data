The function processes a string of length \( n \) consisting only of '0's and '1's, and two indices \( s \) and \( f \) (both \( 1 \leq s, f \leq n \)). It calculates the maximum number of consecutive matching characters starting from index \( s \) and ending at index \( f \). The function returns the minimum distance between the start and end of the longest sequence of matching characters found. If no such sequence exists, it returns 0. Edge cases include when \( s \) and \( f \) are the same or when the entire string is uniform.
