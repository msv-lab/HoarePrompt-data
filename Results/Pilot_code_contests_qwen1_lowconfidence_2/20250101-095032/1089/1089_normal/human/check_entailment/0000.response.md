Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where the start and end airports belong to different companies and there is no intermediate airport that belongs to the same company as the start airport.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 1 4
1010
```

- The start airport (id 1) and the end airport (id 4) belong to different companies.
- There is no airport between them that belongs to the same company as the start airport.

The correct output should be `1`, as explained in the problem description. However, the given program does not account for this scenario correctly. It calculates the cost as the distance between the start and end airports without considering whether the intermediate airports can reduce the cost. Thus, the program incorrectly outputs `0` instead of `1`.

Therefore, the program is not correct.
