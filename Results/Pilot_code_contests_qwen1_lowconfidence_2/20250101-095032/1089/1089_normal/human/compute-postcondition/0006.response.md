Postcondition: ***`n` is a specific integer (previously 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s` is the smaller of the original `s` and `f`, `f` is the larger of the original `s` and `f`, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1', `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, each being either 0 or 1, `cnt` is a list of `n` elements, each set to 0, `s` is `s - 1`. The first element of `numbers` is equal to the element at index `s` in `numbers`.***
