`cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, `cnt[i - 1]` is `cnt[1]`. The value of `cnt[1]` can be 0 or 1. Therefore, `cnt[2]` will also be 0 or 1.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `numbers[i]` equals either `numbers[s]` or `numbers[1]`, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `numbers[2]` equals `numbers[s]`, `cnt[2]` is 0 or 1**
