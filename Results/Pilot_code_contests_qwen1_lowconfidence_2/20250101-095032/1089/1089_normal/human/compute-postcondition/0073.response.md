The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to rely on external inputs or a predefined string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1'. The function also has constraints on `n`, `a`, and `b`, but these are not passed as parameters to the function. 

Based on the output cases provided, the function likely processes this string and returns a value based on some condition related to `a`, `b`, and the binary string.

Given the output cases are not explicitly defined in the problem statement, we will focus on the parameters and their constraints:

The functionality of the function `func` is to process a predefined string of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`) consisting only of characters '0' and '1', and two integers `a` and `b` (where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n`), and return a value based on some condition involving these inputs and the string.
