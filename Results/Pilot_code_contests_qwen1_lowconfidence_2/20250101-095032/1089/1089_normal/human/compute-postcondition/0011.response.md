The code `cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1] + 1` increments the value of `cnt[i]` by 1, using the value of `cnt[i - 1]`. Since `i` is initially 1, `cnt[i - 1]` refers to `cnt[0]`. Given that `cnt[0]` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, it is safe to assume it is 0 (common default for counters). Therefore, `cnt[1]` is set to `0 + 1`, which is 1.

The output state is: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `numbers[i]` is equal to `numbers[s]`, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 1**.
