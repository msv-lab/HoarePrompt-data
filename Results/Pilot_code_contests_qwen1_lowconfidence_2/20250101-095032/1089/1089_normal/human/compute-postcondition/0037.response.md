The value of `r` is assigned the value of `m`. The initial value of `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`, so `r` now holds this value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `numbers`, for all `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `cnt[j]` is the cumulative count of consecutive matches starting from `numbers[s]` up to `numbers[j]`, `ans` is `f - s`, `l` is -1, `r` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n - 1) // 2**
