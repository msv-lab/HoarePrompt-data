Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `numbers` and `numbers[s]`, and for all `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `cnt[j]` is the cumulative count of consecutive matches starting from `numbers[s]` up to `numbers[j]`; `ans` is `f - s`. The current value of `numbers[s]` is not equal to `numbers[f]`***
