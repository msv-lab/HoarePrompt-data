The code `n, s, f = map(int, stdin.readline().split())` reads three integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `s`, and `f`. This means that `n` is no longer just "an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5," but instead has a specific integer value. Similarly, `s` and `f` also get specific integer values. The string `a` of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1' remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a specific integer (previously 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s` is a specific integer (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `f` is a specific integer (1 ≤ f ≤ n), and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.**
