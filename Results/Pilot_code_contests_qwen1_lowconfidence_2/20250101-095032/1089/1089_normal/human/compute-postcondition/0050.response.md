Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `numbers` and `numbers[s]`, for all `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `cnt[j]` is the cumulative count of consecutive matches starting from `numbers[s]` up to `numbers[j]`, `ans` is `f - s`, `l` is `-1`, `r` is `n`, `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and the condition `cnt[m] >= cnt[f]` is satisfied**
