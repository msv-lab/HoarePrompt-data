Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 2, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `numbers` and `numbers[s]`, for all `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `cnt[j]` is the cumulative count of consecutive matches starting from `numbers[s]` up to `numbers[j]`, `ans` is `f - s` or `m - s`, `l` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `r` is \(\left(\frac{3n - 1}{2}\right) // 2\), and `m` is \(\left(\frac{3n - 1}{2}\right) // 2\). If `cnt[m] >= cnt[f]`, then `ans` is `m - s`; otherwise, `ans` is `f - s`.***
