Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `numbers`, for all `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `cnt[j]` is the cumulative count of consecutive matches starting from `numbers[s]` up to `numbers[j]`, `ans` is `f - s`, `l` is either `-1` or `(n - 1) // 2`, `r` is either `(n - 1) // 2` or `n`, `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`. If `cnt[m] > cnt[f]`, then `l` is set to `(n - 1) // 2` and `r` is set to `(n - 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `l` is set to `-1` and `r` is set to `n`.***
