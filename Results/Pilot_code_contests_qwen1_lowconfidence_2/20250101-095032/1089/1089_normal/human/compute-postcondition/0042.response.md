The code `r = m` assigns the value of `m` to `r`. Given that `m` is initially `(n - 1) // 2`, `r` is updated to be the same value as `m`. The value of `l` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state is: `l` is `-1` or `(n - 1) // 2`; `r` is `(n - 1) // 2`; `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`l` is `-1` or `(n - 1) // 2`; `r` is `(n - 1) // 2`; `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`**
