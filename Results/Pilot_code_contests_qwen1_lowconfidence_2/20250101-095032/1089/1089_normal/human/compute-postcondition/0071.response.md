Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `numbers[i]` is not applicable since `i` is `n`, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `numbers` and `numbers[s]`, for all `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `cnt[j]` is the cumulative count of consecutive matches starting from `numbers[s]` up to `numbers[j]`, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` (initially `f - s`) and `f - r` where `r = (5n - 3) // 8` if `cnt[m] >= cnt[f]` else `r = (3n - 1) // 4`, or 0 if the if condition is not met.***
