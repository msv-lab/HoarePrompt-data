Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `numbers` and `numbers[s]`, for all `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `cnt[j]` is the cumulative count of consecutive matches starting from `numbers[s]` up to `numbers[j]`, `ans` is `f - s`, `l` is `-1` or `(n - 1) // 2`, `r` is `(n - 1) // 2` or `n`, `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`. After the loop terminates, `l` and `r` will be such that `l <= r` and no further divisions are possible, meaning the final value of `r` will be the greatest index `k` such that `cnt[k] > cnt[f]`, and `l` will be `r - 1`. If no such `k` exists, `l` will be `-1` and `r` will be `n`.**
