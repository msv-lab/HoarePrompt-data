Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `numbers` and `numbers[s]` and for all `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `cnt[j]` is the cumulative count of consecutive matches starting from `numbers[s]` up to `numbers[j]`, `ans` is `f - s`, `l` is -1, `r` is `n`, `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`. If `cnt[m]` is greater than `cnt[f]`, then `l` is set to \((n - 1) // 2\). Otherwise, `l` is set to -1.***
