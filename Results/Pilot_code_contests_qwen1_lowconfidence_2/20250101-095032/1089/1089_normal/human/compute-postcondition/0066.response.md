Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 3, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `numbers` and `numbers[s]`, for all `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `cnt[j]` is the cumulative count of consecutive matches starting from `numbers[s]` up to `numbers[j]`, `ans` is `m - s` or `f - s`, `l` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `r` is \((3n - 1) // 4\), `m` is \((5n - 3) // 8\). If `cnt[m] >= cnt[f]`, then `r = (5n - 3) // 8` and otherwise `r = (3n - 1) // 4`. The current value of `r` is not equal to `n`***
