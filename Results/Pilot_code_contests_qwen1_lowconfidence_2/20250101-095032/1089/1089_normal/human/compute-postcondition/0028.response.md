Let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop step by step:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `i` is `n`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `cnt[0]` is 0
   - `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `numbers` and `numbers[s]`
   - For all `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `cnt[j]` is the cumulative count of consecutive matches starting from `numbers[s]` up to `numbers[j]`
   - `ans` is `f - s`
   - `l` is -1
   - `r` is `n`

2. **Condition for the Loop:**
   ```python
   while r > l + 1:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that the condition `r > l + 1` holds true.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `l` is -1
   - `r` is `n`

Given `l = -1` and `r = n`, the condition `r > l + 1` becomes `n > -1 + 1` or `n > 0`.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The condition `n > 0` is already satisfied since `n` is stated to be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `n`.
   - The values of `i`, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, `ans`, and `l` do not affect the loop condition directly.
   - `r` being `n` is already correct for the loop to start executing.

Since all the required conditions are already met with the current state, no modifications are necessary.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `numbers` and `numbers[s]`, for all `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `cnt[j]` is the cumulative count of consecutive matches starting from `numbers[s]` up to `numbers[j]`, `ans` is `f - s`, `l` is -1, `r` is `n`**
