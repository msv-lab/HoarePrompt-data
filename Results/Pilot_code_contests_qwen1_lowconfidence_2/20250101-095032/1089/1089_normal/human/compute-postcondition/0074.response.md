Functionality: **The function processes a string of length \( n \) consisting only of '0's and '1's, and two indices \( s \) and \( f \) (both \( 1 \leq s, f \leq n \)). It calculates the maximum number of consecutive matching characters starting from index \( s \) and ending at index \( f \). The function returns the minimum distance between the start and end of the longest sequence of matching characters found. If no such sequence exists, it returns 0. Edge cases include when \( s \) and \( f \) are the same or when the entire string is uniform.**

**Detailed Summary:**
- The function reads \( n \), \( s \), and \( f \) from standard input, where \( n \) is the length of the string and \( s \) and \( f \) are indices within the string.
- It converts the string into a list of integers and initializes a count array to keep track of the cumulative counts of consecutive matches starting from index \( s \).
- It adjusts \( s \) and \( f \) to ensure \( s \leq f \).
- The function then iterates through the string to populate the count array with the cumulative count of consecutive matches starting from index \( s \).
- It calculates the initial distance \( ans \) as \( f - s \).
- Depending on whether the character at \( s \) matches the character at \( f \), the function performs binary search operations to find the largest index \( k \) such that the cumulative count of matches up to \( k \) is greater than or equal to the cumulative count at \( f \).
- If such an index \( k \) is found, it updates \( ans \) to be the minimum of its current value and \( f - k \).
- If no such \( k \) exists, or if the initial characters at \( s \) and \( f \) do not match, \( ans \) remains unchanged.
- Finally, the function writes the result to standard output.
