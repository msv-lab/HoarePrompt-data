Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 3, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `numbers` and `numbers[s]`, for all `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `cnt[j]` is the cumulative count of consecutive matches starting from `numbers[s]` up to `numbers[j]`, `ans` is `min(ans, f - r)` where `r = (5n - 3) // 8` if `cnt[m] >= cnt[f]` else `r = (3n - 1) // 4`, `l` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `m` is \((5n - 3) // 8\), `r` is \((5n - 3) // 8\) if `cnt[m] >= cnt[f]` else \((3n - 1) // 4\), the current value of `r` is not equal to `n`.***
