The code `cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1]` updates `cnt[i]` to be the same as `cnt[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `cnt[i - 1]` corresponds to `cnt[2]`. The initial state tells us that `cnt[2]` is 1 or 0 depending on whether `numbers[3]` equals `numbers[s]`.

Since `cnt[i]` is updated to `cnt[i - 1]`, `cnt[3]` will now be the same as `cnt[2]`. The value of `cnt[2]` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is 1 or 0 depending on whether `numbers[3]` equals `numbers[s]`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `numbers[i]` equals either `numbers[s]` or `numbers[1]`, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `numbers[3]` equals `numbers[s]`, `cnt[2]` is 1 or 0 depending on whether `numbers[3]` equals `numbers[s]`, `cnt[3]` is 1 or 0 depending on whether `numbers[3]` equals `numbers[s]`**
