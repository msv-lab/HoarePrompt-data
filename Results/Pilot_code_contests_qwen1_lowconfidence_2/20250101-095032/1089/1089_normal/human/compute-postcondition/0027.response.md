`r` is assigned the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1 depending on the first element of `numbers` and `numbers[s]` and for all `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `cnt[j]` is the cumulative count of consecutive matches starting from `numbers[s]` up to `numbers[j]`; `ans` is `f - s`; `l` is -1; `r` is `n`.
