Postcondition: ***`n` is a specific integer (previously 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s` is the smaller of the original `s` and `f`, `f` is the larger of the original `s` and `f`, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1', `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, each being either 0 or 1, `cnt` is a list of `n` elements, with the first element set to `1` and the rest set to `0`, `s` is `s - 1`. If the first element of `numbers` is equal to the element at index `s` in `numbers`, the first element of `cnt` is set to `1`. Otherwise, the first element of `cnt` remains `0`.***
