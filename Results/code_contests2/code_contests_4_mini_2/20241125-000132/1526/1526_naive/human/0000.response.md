Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the string is "beautiful" by checking if each character in the input string occurs an even number of times. Here's how it works:

1. It initializes a dictionary `memo` to count occurrences of each character in the string.
2. It iterates through each character in the string, updating the count in the `memo` dictionary.
3. After counting all characters, it checks if all counts are even.
4. If all counts are even, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

The program adheres to the problem description and handles the constraints correctly, including edge cases such as strings with all unique characters or strings where some characters occur an odd number of times.

For instance:
- For input "abaccaba", the counts are: a: 4, b: 2, c: 2 (all even), resulting in "Yes".
- For input "hthth", the counts are: h: 2, t: 3 (t is odd), resulting in "No".

Since the program meets the requirements for all potential cases, it is deemed correct.
