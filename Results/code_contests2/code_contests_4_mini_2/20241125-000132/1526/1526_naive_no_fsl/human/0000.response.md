To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the specified problem description, let's analyze the code and the conditions it checks for.

### Problem Description Recap:
A string `w` is defined as beautiful if every lowercase letter from `a` to `z` appears an even number of times in `w`. The output should be "Yes" if the string is beautiful and "No" otherwise.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()  # This line reads input (for Python 2.x)
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        memo[c] += 1
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')

func_1()
```

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads a string input `s`.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: It uses a dictionary `memo` to count occurrences of each character in `s`.
3. **Checking for Even Counts**: The program iterates over the counts in `memo`, checking if any count is odd. If it finds any odd count, it sets `result` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints "Yes" if `result` is `True`, otherwise it prints "No".

### Potential Edge Case Analysis:
- The program appears to handle the counting of characters correctly.
- It checks if each character count is even or odd correctly.
- It outputs the correct string based on the value of `result`.

### Example Cases:
- For the input `abaccaba`, the character counts would be:
  - `a`: 4
  - `b`: 2
  - `c`: 2
  All counts are even, so it outputs "Yes".
  
- For the input `hthth`, the character counts would be:
  - `h`: 2
  - `t`: 3
  - `h`: 2
  The count of `t` is odd, so it outputs "No".

### Issues Identified:
The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. This means if executed in a Python 3 environment, it will raise an error, leading to a failure in execution.

### Conclusion:
Although the logic for checking if a string is beautiful is correct, the implementation fails to run in Python 3 due to the input handling method being outdated.

Correctness: **False**

**Reason**: The program will not run in Python 3 because it uses `raw_input()` instead of `input()`, leading to an error when trying to read input. Thus, it does not meet the problem description for all potential cases.
