Postcondition: ***`memo` is a dictionary with at least two entries, `s` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, and `c` is the current character from `s`. If `x` is an odd integer (`x % 2 > 0`), then `result` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x` is even, there is no change to `result` or the flow of execution.***
