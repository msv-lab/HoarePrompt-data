Postcondition: ***`memo` is a dictionary with at least one entry, `s` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, and `c` is the current character from `s`. If `x` is an odd integer (i.e., `x % 2 > 0`), then `result` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x` is even (i.e., `x % 2 == 0`), the program continues without altering `result`.***
