Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, and `c` is the first character of `s`. If `c` is not already a key in the `memo` dictionary, it is added with a value of 0, indicating that `memo` will contain the key `c` with a corresponding value of 0. If `c` is already in `memo`, its value remains unchanged.***
