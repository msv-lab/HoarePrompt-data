The variable `result` is initialized with the value `False`. The other variables `memo`, `s`, and `c` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `memo` is a dictionary with at least one entry, `s` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, `c` is the current character from `s`, and `result` is initialized to `False`.

Output State: **`memo` is a dictionary with at least one entry, `s` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, `c` is the current character from `s`, and `result` is initialized to `False**.
