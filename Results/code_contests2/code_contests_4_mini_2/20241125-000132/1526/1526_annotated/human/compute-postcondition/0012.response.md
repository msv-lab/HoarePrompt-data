The code assigns the value `0` to `memo[c]`. However, it doesn't specify the previous value of `memo[c]`, which could have been any integer value. The impact of this assignment is that `memo[c]` is now set to `0`, regardless of its previous state. The variables `w`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a string with at least 3 characters; `c` is the third character of `s`; `memo[c]` is set to 0**
