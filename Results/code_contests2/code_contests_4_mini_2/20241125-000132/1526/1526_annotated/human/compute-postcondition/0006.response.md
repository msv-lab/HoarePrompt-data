The variable `c` is the first character of the string `s`. The code snippet attempts to increment the value associated with the key `c` in the `memo` dictionary by 1. If `c` is not already a key in `memo`, it would have been added with an initial value of 0, and the operation would result in `memo[c]` becoming 1. If `c` is already a key in `memo`, its value would be incremented by 1.

Since the initial state mentions that if `c` is not in `memo`, it gets added with a value of 0, we can conclude the following:

1. If `c` is not in `memo`, after the operation, `memo[c]` will be 1.
2. If `c` is already in `memo`, after the operation, `memo[c]` will be incremented by 1, but we do not know its original value.

Therefore, the output state reflects both scenarios.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a string with at least 1 character; `c` is the first character of `s`; `memo[c]` is either 1 if it was not previously in `memo` or incremented by 1 if it was already present.**
