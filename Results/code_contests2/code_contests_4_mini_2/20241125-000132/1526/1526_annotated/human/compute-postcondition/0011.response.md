According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute again, the variable `c` must take on the next character in the string `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the second character of `s`. This means that `c` represents `s[1]`. Since `s` has at least 2 characters, we need to ensure that `c` can be updated to the next character in `s`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `c` must be updated to the third character of `s`, which means we need to ensure that `s` has at least 3 characters. Thus, we must adjust `s` to have at least 3 characters, and `c` should be updated to the third character of `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a string with at least 3 characters; `c` is the third character of `s`; `memo[c]` is incremented by 1**
