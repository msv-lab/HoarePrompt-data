According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the input string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character. Since `w` is already a string with a length between 1 and 100, it does not affect the execution of the loop. The variable `c` will represent each character in the input string `s` during the iterations. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `s` is not empty. At the start of the loop, `c` will be assigned the first character of `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `c` is the first character of `s`, `memo` is an empty dictionary**
