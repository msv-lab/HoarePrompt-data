According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `memo` dictionary. The loop will execute for each value in `memo.values()`. At the end of the last iteration, `memo` has at least two entries, so it has more than one value. 

If `x` is the last value that was processed in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be adjusted to the next value in `memo.values()`. Since the loop will iterate over all values in the dictionary, we need to ensure that there is at least one more value in addition to the last processed value.

Thus, to allow the loop to execute once more, we need to ensure that there are still values left in `memo`. Therefore, we can adjust the state as follows: `x` should be set to the next value in `memo.values()` and `memo` should still be a dictionary with at least two entries.

State: **`memo` is a dictionary with at least two entries, `s` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, `c` is the current character from `s`, `x` is the next value in the dictionary**
