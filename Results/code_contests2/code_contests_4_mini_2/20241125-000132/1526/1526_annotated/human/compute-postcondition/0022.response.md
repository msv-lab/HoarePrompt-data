Postcondition: ***`memo` is a dictionary with at least one entry, `s` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, `c` is the current character from `s`. If `x` is an odd integer, then `result` is set to False, indicating that the condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is met. If `x` is even, `result` remains True, and no change occurs to its value or other variables.***
