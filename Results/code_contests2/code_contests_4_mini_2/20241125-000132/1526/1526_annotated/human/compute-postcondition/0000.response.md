The variable `s` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes a string input from the user. The initial state of `w` is unaffected by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged state of `w` and the new assignment of `s`. 

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is an input string**
