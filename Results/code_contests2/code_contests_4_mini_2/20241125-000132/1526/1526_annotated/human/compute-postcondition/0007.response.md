According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as there are characters in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the first character of `s`, and since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, we need to consider the state of `c` for the next iteration.

If `s` has at least one character, then `c` will be set to the next character in `s` for the loop to execute again. Since `memo[c]` is incremented or initialized during the loop, it indicates that `c` was just processed.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `c` to the next character in `s` and confirm that `s` contains more characters than it has been iterated over so far.

Assuming the previous iteration processed the first character and there are more characters left in `s`, we need to update `c` to the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a string with at least 2 characters; `c` is the second character of `s`; `memo[c]` is either 1 or incremented by 1 depending on its previous state.**
