The code assigns the value `0` to the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. Given that `c` is the first character of `s`, and `memo` is initially an empty dictionary with `c` not being a key, the assignment modifies the state of `memo` to include `c` as a key with a value of `0`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a string with at least 1 character; `c` is the first character of `s`; `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value 0**
