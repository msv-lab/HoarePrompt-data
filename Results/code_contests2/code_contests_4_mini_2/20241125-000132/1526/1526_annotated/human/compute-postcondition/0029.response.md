The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `memo` is a dictionary with at least two entries, `s` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, `c` is the current character from `s`, and `result` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
