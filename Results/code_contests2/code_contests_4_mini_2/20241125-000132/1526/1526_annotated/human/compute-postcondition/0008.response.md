The value of `memo[c]` is assigned 0. The previous state of `memo[c]` could either be 1 or some incremented value, but it is now explicitly set to 0. The states of the other variables (`w`, `s`, and `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a string with at least 2 characters; `c` is the second character of `s`; `memo[c]` is now 0.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a string with at least 2 characters; `c` is the second character of `s`; `memo[c]` is now 0**
