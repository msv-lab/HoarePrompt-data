The variable `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. The value of `c` is the second character of the string `s`. If `c` was not already in `memo`, it has been initialized to 0, and now it will be 1 after the increment. If `c` was already in `memo`, its previous value is increased by 1. The state of `w` and `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a string with at least 2 characters; `c` is the second character of `s`; `memo[c]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a string with at least 2 characters; `c` is the second character of `s`; `memo[c]` is incremented by 1**.
