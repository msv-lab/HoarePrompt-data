According to the code, the loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. The loop will execute one more time if there are still characters in `s` to be processed.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the third character of `s`, which means the current value of `c` corresponds to the position 2 (0-based index) in the string. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be the fourth character of `s`, and the index must be updated to 3.

Since `s` is stated to have at least 3 characters, and `c` being the third character indicates that there are more characters in `s`, the total length of `s` should be at least 4 characters for the loop to run again.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a string with at least 4 characters; `c` is the fourth character of `s`; `memo[c]` is either unchanged if `c` is already a key in `memo`, or `memo[c]` is 1 if `c` was not previously a key in `memo`.**
