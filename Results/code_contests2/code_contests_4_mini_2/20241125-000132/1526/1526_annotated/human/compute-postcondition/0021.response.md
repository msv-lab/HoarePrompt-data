The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `memo` is a dictionary with at least one entry, `s` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, `c` is the current character from `s`, `result` is False, `x` is an odd integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
