To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we will analyze the code against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine if a given string `w` (consisting of lowercase letters) is "beautiful." A string is defined as beautiful if each lowercase letter appears an even number of times.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations in the code correctly describe what happens during the execution of the program. Here’s a breakdown:

1. The program reads a string `s`.
2. It initializes a dictionary `memo` to count occurrences of each character in `s`.
3. After iterating through `s`, `memo` accurately reflects the count of each character.
4. The program then checks if all counts in `memo` are even.
5. It prints "Yes" if `result` is `True` (meaning all counts are even) and "No" otherwise.

### Code Review:
Here's the implementation as described:

```python
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        
        memo[c] += 1
        
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
        
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')
```

### Edge Case Testing:
1. **Single Character Input**: For example, if the input is "a", the output should be "No" since 'a' occurs once, which is odd.
2. **All Characters Occur Evenly**: For the input "aabbcc", the output should be "Yes". In this case, all characters occur an even number of times.
3. **Mixed Characters**: For the input "abcabc", the output should also be "Yes" since each character occurs twice.
4. **Characters Occurring Oddly**: For the input "abc", the output should be "No" as each character occurs once.
5. **Empty Case**: The constraint states `1 ≤ |w|`, so there should never be an empty string, but if there were, the result would be ambiguous since no characters could mean all even counts.

### Conclusion:
The code handles all possible cases correctly as per the given problem statement. It accurately counts occurrences and checks for evenness.

Thus, the program meets the requirements for every potential case specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
