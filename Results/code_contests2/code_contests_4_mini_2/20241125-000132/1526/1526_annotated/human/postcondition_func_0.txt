The function reads a string input from the user and checks if all characters in the string appear an even number of times. It prints 'Yes' if all character counts are even, and 'No' if any character count is odd. The function does not accept any parameters and lacks explicit return statements. It operates correctly under the assumption that the input string contains at least one character. If an empty string were to be input (which is not allowed as per requirements), the function would still correctly print 'Yes' since there would be no characters with odd occurrences.
