The line `memo[c] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. If `c` is not already present in `memo`, it will be added with the value `0`. If `c` is already present, its value will be updated to `0`, but the previous value remains unchanged. The states of the other variables (`w`, `s`, and `c`) are not affected.

Thus, the output state is: `w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a non-empty input string; `c` is the second character of `s; `memo[c]` is set to 0.

Output State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a non-empty input string; `c` is the second character of `s; `memo[c]` is set to 0.**
