According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the first character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be updated to the next character in `s`, and we need to ensure that there are still characters left in the string. 

Since `s` is a non-empty input string, and `c` is the first character in the last iteration, moving to the next iteration means `c` should be the second character of `s`, and the loop index must reflect that we have processed one character already.

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a non-empty input string; `c` is the second character of `s; `memo[c]` remains unchanged or is set to 0 if `c` is not already in `memo`**
