The variable `result` is assigned the value `False`. The initial state of `memo` as a dictionary with at least 3 entries and `x` being the next value in that dictionary is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `memo` and `x`, along with the new value of `result`.

Output State: **`memo` is a dictionary with at least 3 entries, `x` is the next value in the dictionary, `result` is False**
