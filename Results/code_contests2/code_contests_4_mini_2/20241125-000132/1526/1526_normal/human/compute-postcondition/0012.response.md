The code assigns the value `0` to `memo[c]`. The previous state indicates that `memo[c]` was incremented by 1 before this assignment, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. Therefore, the value of `memo[c]` is now `0`, and other variables remain unchanged. The output state is: `w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` has at least 3 characters; `c` is the third character of `s`; `memo[c]` is now 0.

Output State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` has at least 3 characters; `c` is the third character of `s`; `memo[c]` is now 0**
