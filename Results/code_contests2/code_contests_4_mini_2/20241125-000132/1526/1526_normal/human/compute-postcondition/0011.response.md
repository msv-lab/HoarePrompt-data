According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. The loop will execute again as long as there are more characters in `s` to iterate over. 

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the second character of `s`. This means that `c` has already been set to that character, and for the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be updated to the next character in `s`. 

To determine the state adjustments:
- Since `c` is currently the second character, we need to check that `s` has at least 3 characters for the loop to continue.
- Therefore, `s` must have a length of at least 3 characters, and `c` should be updated to the third character of `s`.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `s` has at least 3 characters, and `c` is now the third character of `s`.

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` has at least 3 characters; `c` is the third character of `s`; `memo[c]` is incremented by 1**
