The variable `memo[c]` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state indicates that `c` is the first character of `s` and is not present in the collection `memo`, suggesting that `memo` is a dictionary that allows for the addition of new key-value pairs. Other variables such as `w` and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty input string, `c` is the first character of `s`, and `memo[c]` is now 0.

Output State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty input string, `c` is the first character of `s`, and `memo[c]` is now 0**
