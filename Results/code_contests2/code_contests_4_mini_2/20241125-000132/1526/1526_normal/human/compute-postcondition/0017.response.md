The variable `result` is assigned the value `True`. The previous state of `memo` is not affected by this assignment since the variable `result` is independent of `memo`. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the assignment made.

Output State: **`memo` is a dictionary containing the counts of each character in `s`; `result` is True**
