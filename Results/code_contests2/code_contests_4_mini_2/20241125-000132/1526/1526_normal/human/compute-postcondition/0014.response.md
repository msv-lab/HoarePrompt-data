The variable `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` was not previously in `memo`, it was initialized to 0 before this operation, so after execution, it will be 1. If `c` was already in `memo`, its previous value will be increased by 1. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` has at least 3 characters; `c` is the third character of `s`; `memo[c]` is either 1 or its previous value incremented by 1.
