According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 3 characters, and `c` is the third character of `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 4 characters, and `c` should be updated to the fourth character in `s`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` should have at least 4 characters.
- `c` should be the fourth character of `s`.

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` has at least 4 characters; `c` is the fourth character of `s`; `memo[c]` is either 1 or its previous value incremented by 1**
