According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the entries in the `memo` dictionary. If the dictionary has at least 4 entries, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `memo` has at least 3 entries, so to allow the loop to execute one more time, it must have at least 4 entries. The variable `x` will take the next value from the dictionary's values. Therefore, `x` needs to be the next value from `memo.values()`, which will be the fourth value.

State: **`memo` is a dictionary with at least 4 entries, x is the fourth value in `memo.values()`**
