Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input from the user and counts the occurrences of each character in the string. It checks if all characters appear an even number of times; if they do, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not handle empty input strings specifically, but it will print 'Yes' if an empty string is provided since there are no characters with an odd count. **
