The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `memo` is a dictionary with at least 2 entries, `x` is the next value in `memo.values()`, and `result` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
