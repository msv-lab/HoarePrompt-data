To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the code and the problem description closely.

### Problem Description Recap:
You need to embed a 2n-gon (which has 2n vertices) in a square, and the task is to find the minimum length of a side of the square that can contain this 2n-gon. The polygon is regular, has equal sides, and is convex.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the value of math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)), for each positive odd integer n in the range 3 to 199.
```

### Checking the Logic:
1. **Input Constraints**: The function accepts a single odd integer `n` within the range [3, 199].
2. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - The formula used in the function is `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`.
   - This formula is derived from trigonometric properties related to the geometry of the polygon and its embedding within a square.

### Understanding the Formula:
- The 2n-gon can be inscribed in a square, and the length of the square's side can be computed based on the angles formed by the vertices of the polygon.
- The denominator `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` computes the height of the polygon from its center to a vertex.
- The numerator `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n))` adjusts the width based on the polygon's symmetry and the angles involved.

### Edge Cases:
- Let's evaluate if the function handles the minimum value for `n`, which is 3. 
  - For `n = 3`: The function will return `math.cos(math.pi / 12) / math.sin(math.pi / 6)`, which is a calculable value.
- The function should also return valid results for the maximum value of `n = 199`.

### Accuracy Check:
- The output is expected to have an absolute or relative error not exceeding 10^{-6}. The mathematical functions used (`cos` and `sin`) are precise, and Python's floating-point arithmetic should maintain this precision for the given range of `n`.

### Conclusion:
Upon analyzing the code, it correctly implements the formula for calculating the minimum size of the square to embed the 2n-gon. The formula is mathematically sound and meets the problem's requirements for all odd integers `n` from 3 to 199.

No edge cases or incorrect scenarios were identified that would cause the function to fail or produce inaccurate results.

Correctness: **True**
