The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. However, the function does not include any validation for `n`, meaning if `n` is 0 or negative, it may result in a division by zero or other undefined behavior. The function is intended for positive odd integers in the range 3 to 199.
