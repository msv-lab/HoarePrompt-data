The provided program is designed to calculate the minimum size of a square in which a 2n-gon (with 2n vertices) can be embedded, based on the input of odd integers n. 

Let's break down the code and check its correctness against the problem description:

1. **Functionality of the Code**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` computes the expression `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. This should theoretically give a valid output for any odd integer n according to the problem statement.
   - The code takes multiple test cases, reads the value of n, and prints the result formatted to 9 decimal places.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem states that n is always an odd integer in the range [3, 199]. Therefore, the checks for n being odd and within the specified bounds have already been satisfied by the problem constraints, meaning the function does not need to handle invalid inputs for n.
   - However, the output hints mention that the code does not handle potential division by zero errors. This is a critical point because if `n` were allowed to be 0 or negative (which it isn't in this problem), it would lead to invalid calculations in the sine function. But since n is constrained to be odd integers starting from 3, this particular division by zero error will not occur in the given constraints.

3. **Output Hints**:
   - The output hints correctly summarize the function's output without introducing any invalid cases. They highlight that the function does not check for invalid inputs, but since the problem guarantees valid inputs, this does not affect correctness.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The code seems to follow the problem description as it calculates the required minimum size of the square for valid inputs. It does not need to handle edge cases that are outside the constraints given by the problem.

Given that the function is correctly implemented for all valid inputs according to the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
