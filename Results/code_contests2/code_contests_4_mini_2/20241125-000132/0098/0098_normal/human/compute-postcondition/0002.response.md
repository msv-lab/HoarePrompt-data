Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and returns the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. However, it does not ensure that `n` is an odd integer and does not handle potential division by zero errors when `n` is 0 or any negative integer that leads to invalid calculations in the sine function.**
