Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to calculate the minimum side length of a square that can contain a regular polygon with \(2n\) vertices (a \(2n\)-gon). However, the function `func_1(n)` uses the formula `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. 

This formula does not seem to accurately represent the requirements for embedding a \(2n\)-gon in a square, especially for varying values of \(n\). In particular, there is no validation or check for the input value being odd as specified, since the problem states that \(n\) must be an odd integer. The program also fails to handle cases where \(n\) is outside the specified range (3 ≤ n ≤ 199).

To illustrate a case where the program fails:
- If \(n = 3\), the expected output is approximately \(1.931851653\) according to the example provided. However, for larger odd integers, the behavior of the function may diverge from the expected results as \(n\) approaches its upper limit.

Since the formula does not account for all edge cases and the conditions specified in the problem description, the program does not meet the correctness criteria.

Thus, the program is deemed incorrect.
