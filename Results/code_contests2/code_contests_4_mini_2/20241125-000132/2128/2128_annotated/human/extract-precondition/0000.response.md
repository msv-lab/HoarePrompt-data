Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), n is a positive integer (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 200000), k is a non-negative integer, and a_i are non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial amounts of water in the barrels. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 200,000.**
