According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, `k` must also be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`ans` is updated by adding `arr[2]`, `l` is 3, `k` is at least 3**
