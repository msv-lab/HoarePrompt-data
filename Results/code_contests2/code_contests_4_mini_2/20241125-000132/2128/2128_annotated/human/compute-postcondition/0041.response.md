According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `k`. The loop is defined to run from `1` to `k + 1`, meaning that `k` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute at least once. 

Given the initial states:
- `k` is at least `0`, which means it could be `0`, and in that case, the loop would not execute.
- If `k` is equal to `0`, then the loop will not run as the range would be `range(1, 1)`, which is empty.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that:
- `k` is at least `1`.

Additionally, since `arr` is mentioned in the context, `ans`, `i`, and `t` are not directly influencing the execution of the loop based on the information provided.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust `k` to be at least `1` (if it was initially `0`).

State: **`k` is at least 1, `ans` is now equal to `arr[0]`, `i` is at least 1, `t` is greater than 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order**
