The value of `k` is assigned as `n - 1`. The value of `n` is not provided, but it is stated that `k` is at least 0, which implies that `n` must be at least 1. Therefore, the minimum value for `k` can be calculated as `0` (when `n` is `1`). The other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the Output State is: `k` is at least 0; `ans` is now equal to `arr[0]`; `i` is at least 1; `t` is greater than 1; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `k` is `n - 1` (where `n` is at least 1).

Output State: **`k` is at least 0; `ans` is now equal to `arr[0]`; `i` is at least 1; `t` is greater than 1; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `k` is `n - 1`.**
