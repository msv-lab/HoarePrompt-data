The code `ans += arr[l]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value at index `l` of `arr` to it. The variable `l` has a value of 2, and `arr` is sorted in descending order. Therefore, `arr[l]` corresponds to the third element of the array. The previous values of the affected variables are `ans`, which is updated, and `arr`, which has a specific value at index 2.

Since `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, and `l` is 2, the output state reflects the new value of `ans` after the addition, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[2]` to it, `k` is at least 1, `l` is 2**
