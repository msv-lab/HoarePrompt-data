According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `l` equal to 2 and `k` at least 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `l` must be incremented to 3.

Additionally, since `k` is at least 2, we need to adjust it to ensure that `k` is at least 3 for the loop to potentially execute again. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

State: **`k` is at least 3, `ans` is now equal to `arr[0] + arr[2] + arr[l]`, `i` is at least 1, `t` is greater than 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 3**
