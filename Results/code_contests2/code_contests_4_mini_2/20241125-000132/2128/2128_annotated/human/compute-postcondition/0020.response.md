Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `arr[0]` and the first `k` elements of `arr` starting from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` if `k` is at least 1; if `k` is 0 or less, `ans` remains equal to `arr[0]`, `i` is `t`, `t` is greater than `i`, `n` and `k` are input integers, and `arr` is a list of integers read from input.**
