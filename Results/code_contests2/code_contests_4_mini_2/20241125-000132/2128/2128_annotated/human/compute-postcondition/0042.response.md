The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. The initial state indicates that `ans` is equal to `arr[0]`, and since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[l]` will be a value that is less than or equal to `arr[0]`. The specific value of `arr[l]` is not provided, but it is implied to be a valid index within the array. Thus, `ans` will now have a new value which is the sum of its previous value and `arr[l]`. 

The other variables `k`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`k` is at least 1, `ans` is now equal to `arr[0] + arr[l]`, `i` is at least 1, `t` is greater than 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order**
