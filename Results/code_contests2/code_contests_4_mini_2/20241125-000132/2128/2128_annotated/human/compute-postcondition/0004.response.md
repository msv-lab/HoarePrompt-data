The code sorts the list `arr` in descending order (reverse=True). The initial values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. However, the order of elements in `arr` will change based on its initial state. The output state will reflect the new order of `arr`, while `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, and `arr` is sorted in descending order**
