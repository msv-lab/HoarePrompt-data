According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its last value, which is `i` from the previous iteration. The loop iterates from `0` to `t-1`, so if the last value of `i` was `t - 1`, it means it has reached the upper limit of the loop and will not execute again. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, meaning `i` should be set to `t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be adjusted to be greater than `i`, which means `t` must be at least `i + 1`.

State: **`ans` is the sum of `arr[0]` and the first `k` elements of `arr` starting from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` if `k` is at least 1; if `k` is 0 or less, `ans` remains equal to `arr[0]`, `i` is `t`, `t` is greater than `i`**
