The value of `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`, where `l` is 2. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, and `arr[2]` is the value at index 2 of the array `arr`. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated by adding `arr[2]`, `l` is 2, and `k` is at least 2.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `arr[2]`, `l` is 2, and `k` is at least 2**
