According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the upper limit defined by `k`. The loop iterates through values of `l` from 1 to `k` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, and we know that `k` is at least 1 and less than `n`. 

To execute one more time, `l` must be incremented. Therefore, `l` should be adjusted to 2. Since `k` is at least 1 and less than `n`, it remains valid for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted since `ans` and `k` do not change within the loop's context.

State: **`ans` is the sum of `arr[0]` and the first `k` elements of `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`, plus `arr[1]`; `k` is at least 1, `k` is less than `n`, and `l` is 2**
