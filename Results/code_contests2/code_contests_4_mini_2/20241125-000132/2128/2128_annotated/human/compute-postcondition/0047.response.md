According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `k`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 3 and `k` is at least 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented to 4, and since we know `k` is at least 3, it must be adjusted to at least 4 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `k` must be adjusted to at least 4.

State: **`k` is at least 4, `ans` is now equal to `arr[0] + arr[2] + arr[3]`, `i` is at least 1, `t` is greater than 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 4**
