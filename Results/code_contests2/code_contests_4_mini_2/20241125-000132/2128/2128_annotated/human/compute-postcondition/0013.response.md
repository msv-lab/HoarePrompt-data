According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2 and `k` is at least 1, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to 3, and `k` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[2]` to it, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3**
