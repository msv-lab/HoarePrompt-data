According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, and `k` is the maximum value for `l` to be valid in the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented to 2. Therefore, it must be ensured that `k` is at least 2, so that the loop can run again.

State: **`ans` is updated by adding `arr[2]`, l is 2, k is at least 2**
