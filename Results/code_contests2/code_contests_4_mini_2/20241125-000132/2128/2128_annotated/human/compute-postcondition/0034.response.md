According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 0, and we need to ensure that it is still less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time. 

Since there is no specific value given for `i` or `t`, we can conclude that for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be adjusted to its next value, which is incremented by 1.

Thus, we need to make sure that `i` is adjusted appropriately and that `t` remains unchanged.

State: **`k` is at least 0, `ans` is determined by the sum of `arr[0]` and elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` (or `arr[1]` to `arr[n-1]` if `k >= n`), `i` is at least 1, `t` is greater than 1**
