The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the array `arr`. The previous state of `ans` is not specified, but it will now hold the value of `arr[0]`. Other variables (`k`, `i`, `t`, and `arr`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is at least 0; `ans` is now equal to `arr[0]`; `i` is at least 1; `t` is greater than 1; `arr` is sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`k` is at least 0; `ans` is now equal to `arr[0]`; `i` is at least 1; `t` is greater than 1; `arr` is sorted in descending order.**
