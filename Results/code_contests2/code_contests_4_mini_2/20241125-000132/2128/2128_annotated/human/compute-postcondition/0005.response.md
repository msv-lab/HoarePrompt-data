`ans` is assigned the value of the first element of `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` is the largest element in the array. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is equal to `arr[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is equal to `arr[0]**
