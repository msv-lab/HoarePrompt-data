The value of `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`. Since `l` is 2, `arr[l]` refers to the third element of the array `arr`, which is not specified but assumed to be a value based on the initial state. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`k` is at least 2, `ans` is now equal to `arr[0] + arr[2] + arr[l]`, `i` is at least 1, `t` is greater than 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 2**
