The value of `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`. Given that `l` is 3, we can conclude that `arr[l]` refers to the fourth element of the sorted array `arr`. However, the specific values of `arr` and `ans` before this operation are not provided. Since `ans` is already defined as `arr[0] + arr[2] + arr[l]`, the new value of `ans` will depend on the addition of `arr[3]`.

The other variables (`k`, `i`, `t`, and the order of `arr`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans`:

Output State: **`k` is at least 3, `ans` is now equal to `arr[0] + arr[2] + arr[3]`, `i` is at least 1, `t` is greater than 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 3**
