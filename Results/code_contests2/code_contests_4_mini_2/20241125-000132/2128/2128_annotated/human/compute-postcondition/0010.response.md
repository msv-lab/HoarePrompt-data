The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. The previous value of `ans` is `arr[0]`, and `arr[l]` is an element from the sorted array `arr`. Since `l` is not defined in the initial state and can vary, the exact value of `arr[l]` is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is updated by adding an unknown value to it.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]` to it, `k` is at least 1**
