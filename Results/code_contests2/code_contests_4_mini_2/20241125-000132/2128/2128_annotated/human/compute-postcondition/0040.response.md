Postcondition: ***`k` is at least 0; `ans` is now equal to `arr[0]`; `i` is at least 1; `t` is greater than 1; `arr` is sorted in descending order. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is set to `n - 1`, ensuring that `k` does not exceed the index bounds of the array. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.***
