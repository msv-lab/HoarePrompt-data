Output State: **For each iteration, `ans` is the sum of `arr[0]` and the first `k` elements of `arr` from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` if `k` is at least 1; if `k` is 0, `ans` is equal to `arr[0]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` will be set to `n - 1`, resulting in `ans` being the sum of all elements in `arr` up to `arr[n-1]`. If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no values are calculated or printed. Cases where `k` is less than 0 are not possible due to the initial constraints. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` will be adjusted to `n - 1`, ensuring that `ans` sums valid indices.**
