The value of `k` is reassigned to `n - 1`. The initial state indicates that `k` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to `n`, meaning `n` is at least 1. Thus, `k` will now be one less than `n`. The new value of `k` will be `n - 1`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `arr`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is equal to `arr[0]`, and `k` is now `n - 1`.**
