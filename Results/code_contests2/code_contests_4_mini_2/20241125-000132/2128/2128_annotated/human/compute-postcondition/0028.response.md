The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Given that `l` is 2, `arr[l]` refers to `arr[2]`. The previous value of `ans` is the sum of `arr[0]` and the first `k` elements of `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`, plus `arr[1]`. The value of `arr[2]` is added to this sum.

The output state reflects the updated value of `ans`, which now includes the additional value from `arr[2]`. Other variables remain unchanged in this context.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `arr[2]`**
