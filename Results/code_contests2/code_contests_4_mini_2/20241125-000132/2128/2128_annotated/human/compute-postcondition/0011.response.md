According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is in the range from 1 to `k`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 (the first iteration), and `k` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented from its current value of 1 to 2. The value of `k` does not need to be adjusted since it is already at least 1, which allows for at least two iterations of the loop (from 1 to k + 1).

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `l` should be updated to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted as they remain valid for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]` to it, `k` is at least 1, `l` is 2**
