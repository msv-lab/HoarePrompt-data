According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is at least 1 and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented to 2, and `k` must be at least 2 to ensure that the loop can continue. 

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `k` needs to be at least 2 (to allow for `l` to go up to `k`).
- `l` should be updated to 2 (as it increments with each iteration).

State: **`k` is at least 2, `ans` is now equal to `arr[0] + arr[l]`, `i` is at least 1, `t` is greater than 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 2**
