The value of `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`, where `l` is 1. The current value of `arr[l]` adds to the existing sum in `ans`. The previous value of `ans` is the sum of `arr[0]` and the first `k` elements of `arr` from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`, and since `l` is 1, we're adding the value of `arr[1]` to `ans`. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `arr[0]` and the first `k` elements of `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`, plus `arr[1]`; `k` is at least 1, `k` is less than `n`, and `l` is 1**
