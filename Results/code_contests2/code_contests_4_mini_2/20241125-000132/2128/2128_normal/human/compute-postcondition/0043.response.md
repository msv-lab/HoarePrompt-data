According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` should be incremented to 2, and since `k` is at least 1, we can safely say that `k` must also be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

Thus, we need to adjust `k` to be at least 2, and update `l` to be 2 for the next iteration. 

State: **`ans` is the maximum value in `arr` plus `arr[l]`, `i` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2**
