Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input value. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is set to `n - 1`. This ensures that `k` is always less than `n`, maintaining the relationship that `k` is at least 0 if `n` is at least 1. The variable `ans` remains the first element of the sorted array `arr`.***
