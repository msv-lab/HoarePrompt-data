The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted array `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` holds the largest value in the array. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input value, `k` is an input value, and `ans` is the first element of the sorted array `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input value, `k` is an input value, and `ans` is the first element of the sorted array `arr`**.
