The value of `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`. The initial value of `ans` is the maximum value in the sorted list `arr` plus `arr[l]` plus `arr[l]`, and `l` is 3, so `arr[l]` is the fourth element of the list `arr`. The other variables `i`, `t`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` is now the previous value plus `arr[l]`. 

Output State: **`ans` is the previous maximum value in the sorted list `arr` plus `arr[l]` plus `arr[l]` plus `arr[l]`; `i` is less than `t`; `t` remains unchanged; `k` is at least 3; `l` is 3**
