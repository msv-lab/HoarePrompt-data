According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is currently 1 and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `l` should be adjusted to 2.

Since `k` is at least 1, it will still be valid for the next iteration after this adjustment. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`ans` is the maximum value in the sorted list `arr` plus `arr[l]`, `i` is less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1, `l` is 2**
