The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `t`, `n`, `k`, and `arr`. 

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, constrained within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. 
- `n` is an integer representing the number of barrels in a test case, constrained within the range 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 200000. 
- `k` is an integer that is less than `n`, constrained within the range 1 ≤ k < n. 
- `arr` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each element represents the initial amount of water in the i-th barrel, with the constraint 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The output behavior of the function is not specified in detail, but it is implied that the function processes the input parameters based on the provided constraints and relationships. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t, n, k, and arr, where t is the number of test cases, n is the number of barrels, k is an index related to the barrels, and arr is a list of non-negative integers representing the water amounts in the barrels.**
