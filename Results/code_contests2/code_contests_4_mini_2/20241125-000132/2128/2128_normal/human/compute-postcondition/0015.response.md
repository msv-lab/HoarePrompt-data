According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the value of `l` and `k`. The loop iterates over `l` from 1 to `k` (inclusive), meaning for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `l` is 1
- `k` is at least 1 

For the loop to execute again, `l` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `k` is at least 1, this means `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue. 

Therefore, to execute one more time:
- `k` must be greater than 2 (to ensure the loop can still execute when `l` becomes 2).

Thus, the adjusted states should reflect that `l` is now 2, and `k` is greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 2, `ans` is the sum of the first element of the sorted array `arr`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[l]`, which is `arr[1]`; `l` is 2**
