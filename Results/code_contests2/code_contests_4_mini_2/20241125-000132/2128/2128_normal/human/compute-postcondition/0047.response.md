According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` in relation to `k`. The loop will execute while `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 3, and `k` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented to 4. Since `k` is at least 3, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 4 for the loop to continue executing. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `l` should be updated to 4.
- `k` should be updated to be at least 4.

State: **`ans` is the maximum value in `arr` plus `arr[2]` plus `arr[2]` plus `arr[l]`, `i` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 4, `l` is 4**
