The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Since `k` is initially an input value and `n` is also an input value, the new value of `k` will be one less than the value of `n`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input value, `k` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is the first element of the sorted array `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input value, `k` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is the first element of the sorted array `arr`**
