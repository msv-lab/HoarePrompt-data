According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `l` is less than or equal to `k`. The loop starts with `l` initialized to 1 and continues until `l` exceeds `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and `k` is at least 2. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented to 3, and we need to ensure that `k` is at least 3 to satisfy the loop condition.

Thus, we need to adjust `k` to be at least 3.

State: **`ans` is the maximum value in `arr` plus `arr[2]` plus `arr[2]`, `i` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3**
