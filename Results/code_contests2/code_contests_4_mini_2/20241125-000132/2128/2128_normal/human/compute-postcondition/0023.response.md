The variable `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The initial state specifies that `ans` is the maximum value in the sorted list `arr`, `i` is less than `t`, and `t` remains unchanged. However, the value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, so the value of `k` cannot be determined explicitly. Therefore, the output state is that `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, but the specific value of `k` remains unknown.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value in the sorted list `arr`, `i` is less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, and `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`**.
