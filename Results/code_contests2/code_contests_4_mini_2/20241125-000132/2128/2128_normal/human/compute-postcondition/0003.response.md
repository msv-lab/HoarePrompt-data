The code assigns a list of integers to `arr` by reading a line of input, splitting it into separate values, and converting those values into integers. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. The output state reflects that `arr` is now a list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input value, `k` is an input value, and `arr` is a list of integers from input**
