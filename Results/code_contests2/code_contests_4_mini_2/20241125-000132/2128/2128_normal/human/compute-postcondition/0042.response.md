The value of `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`. Since `ans` is the maximum value in `arr`, the new value of `ans` will depend on the value of `arr[l]`. However, the specific value of `arr[l]` is unknown. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is the maximum value in `arr` plus `arr[l]`, `i` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, and `k` is at least 1, with `n` being greater than 1 only if `k` was updated.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value in `arr` plus `arr[l]`, `i` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1, and if `k` was updated, then `n` is greater than 1**
