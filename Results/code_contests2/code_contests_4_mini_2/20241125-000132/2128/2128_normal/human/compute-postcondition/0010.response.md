The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. The initial state indicates that `ans` is the first element of the sorted array `arr`, and `l` is presumably a valid index of the array. However, since the exact value of `arr[l]` is unknown, we can't determine the new value of `ans` specifically. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `ans` is the first element of the sorted array `arr`, and `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `ans` is the first element of the sorted array `arr`, and `ans` is increased by `arr[l]**
