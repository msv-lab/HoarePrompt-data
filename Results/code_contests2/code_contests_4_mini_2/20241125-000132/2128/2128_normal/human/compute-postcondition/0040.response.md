Postcondition: ***`ans` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 1, and `t` remains unchanged. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is updated to `n - 1`. If `k` was already less than `n`, it remains unchanged. Thus, `k` will either be `n - 1` or its original value if it was less than `n`.***
