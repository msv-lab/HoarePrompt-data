The value of `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]` to it. Since `l` is 2, we are adding the value of `arr[2]` to `ans`. The previous value of `ans` is defined as the maximum value in `arr` plus `arr[l]`. The other variables `i`, `t`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value in `arr` plus `arr[l]` plus `arr[2]`, `i` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2**
