According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop iterates from `1` to `k + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2 and `k` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented to 3, and we need to ensure that `k` is at least 3 to allow for this.

State: **`ans` is the maximum value in the sorted list `arr` plus `arr[l]` plus `arr[l]`, `i` is less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3**
