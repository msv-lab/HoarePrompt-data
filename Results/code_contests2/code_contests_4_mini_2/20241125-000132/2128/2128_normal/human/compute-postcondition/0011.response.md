To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop.

1. The loop runs with `l` ranging from `1` to `k + 1`. Thus, it will execute for values of `l` as follows: `1, 2, ..., k`. 
2. At the end of the last iteration, we need to consider the last value of `l` used in the loop. Since `k` is at least `1`, the last value of `l` before the loop ends will be `k`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented to `k + 1`, which is the next value in the range.
4. The current values indicate that `k` is at least `1`, meaning that for the next iteration, we need `l` to be `k + 1`.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- The variable `l` will be updated to `k + 1`.
- The condition for `k` does not need an adjustment because it is already `at least 1`, which is sufficient.

The other states (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `arr`) remain unchanged because they do not impact the loop's ability to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `ans` is the first element of the sorted array `arr`, and `l` is `k + 1`**
