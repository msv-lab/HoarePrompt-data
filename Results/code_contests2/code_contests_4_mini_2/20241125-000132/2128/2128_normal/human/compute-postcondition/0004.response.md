The code sorts the list `arr` in descending order. The initial state indicates that `arr` contains integers from input, but does not specify the exact values. Therefore, after sorting, `arr` will have its values rearranged in descending order, but we cannot determine the specific values without additional information. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input value, `k` is an input value, and `arr` is sorted in descending order.**
