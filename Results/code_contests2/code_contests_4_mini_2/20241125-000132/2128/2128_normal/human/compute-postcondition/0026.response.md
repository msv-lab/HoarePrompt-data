The value of `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]` to it. The initial state indicates that `ans` is the maximum value in the sorted list `arr`, and since `l` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`, and `i`, `t`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is the maximum value in the sorted list `arr` plus `arr[l]`, `i` is less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value in the sorted list `arr` plus `arr[l]`, `i` is less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1**
