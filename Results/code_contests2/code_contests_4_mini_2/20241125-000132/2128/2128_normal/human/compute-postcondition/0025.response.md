According to the code, the loop will execute if the value of `k` is at least 1, because `range(1, k + 1)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to and including `k`. 

The current state indicates that `i` is less than `t`, which is not directly relevant to the loop execution but suggests that `t` is unchanged. The variable `k` can either be set to `n - 1` if it is greater than or equal to `n`, or it remains unchanged if it is already less than `n`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `k`:

1. If `k` is set to `n - 1`, we need to ensure that `n - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2.
2. If `k` remains unchanged and is already less than `n`, we should confirm that `k` is at least 1.

Thus, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`ans` is the maximum value in the sorted list `arr`, `i` is less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1**
