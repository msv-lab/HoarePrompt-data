The code sorts the list `arr` in descending order, meaning the largest integer will be the first element and the smallest will be the last element. The variables `ans`, `i`, and `t` remain unaffected by this operation, so their previous states do not change. The output state reflects the new state of `arr` after sorting and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`ans` is printed, `i` is less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, and `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order**
