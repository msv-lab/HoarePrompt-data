The code sorts the list `arr` in descending order. The value of `ans`, which is the maximum value in the original list `arr`, will now be the first element of the newly sorted list. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, `t` remains unchanged, and `n` and `k` are assigned values from input. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is the maximum value in the sorted list `arr`, `i` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, and `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value in the sorted list `arr`, `i` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, and `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order.**
