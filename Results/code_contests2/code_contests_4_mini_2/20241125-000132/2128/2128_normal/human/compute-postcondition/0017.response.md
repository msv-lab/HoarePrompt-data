The code prints the value of `ans`. The initial state specifies how `ans` is determined based on the value of `k` and the array `arr`. Since the exact value of `k` and the contents of `arr` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `ans`. The output state reflects that `ans` is printed but does not specify its value, as it depends on the conditions provided.

Output State: **`ans` is printed, but its value depends on the values of `k` and `arr`.**
