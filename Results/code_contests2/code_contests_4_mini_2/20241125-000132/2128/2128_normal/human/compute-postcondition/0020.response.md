The code assigns a new value to `arr`, which is created by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual string elements, converting them to integers, and then forming a list from those integers. The variable `ans` is printed, and `i` is less than `t`, while `t` remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is `ans` is printed, `i` is less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, and `arr` is a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`ans` is printed, `i` is less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, and `arr` is a list of integers based on the input.**
