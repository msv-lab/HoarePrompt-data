According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, since the range for `l` starts from 1. 

Given that the initial state mentions `i` is 1 and `ans` is the maximum value in `arr`, we need to ensure that `k` is set appropriately:

- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then it will be updated to `n - 1`. In this case, for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1, which means `n` needs to be greater than 1 (since `k` would be `n - 1`).
- If `k` is less than `n`, it remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute, `k` must still be at least 1.

Thus, we can summarize the necessary conditions:

1. `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
2. If `k` is updated to `n - 1`, then `n` must be greater than 1.
3. The initial state of `i` is 1, which is not directly related to the loop condition.

Considering these points, the state can be represented as:

State: **`ans` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1, and if `k` was updated, then `n` is greater than 1**.
