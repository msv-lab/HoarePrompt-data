The code assigns values to `n` and `k` by reading from standard input and splitting the input string. The values are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since `t` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 0, the values of `n` and `k` are not determined from the initial state, as they depend on the user input. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `t` and `i`, along with the assignment result for `n` and `k` being determined by input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `n`, `k` are assigned values from input**
