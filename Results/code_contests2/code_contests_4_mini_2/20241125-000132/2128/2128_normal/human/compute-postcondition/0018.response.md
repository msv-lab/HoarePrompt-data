According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `i` and `t`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, but for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`. 

The statement indicates that the value of `ans` is printed but does not provide information about the current value of `i` or `t`. Assuming the loop has executed at least once, `i` would have been incremented at the end of the last iteration. Consequently, `i` should be adjusted to `i + 1` for the next iteration. 

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `t` for the loop to execute again. The state of `t` remains unchanged, and `ans` is dependent on the values of `k` and `arr`, but those do not affect the loop iteration condition.

State: **`ans` is printed, `i` is less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged**
