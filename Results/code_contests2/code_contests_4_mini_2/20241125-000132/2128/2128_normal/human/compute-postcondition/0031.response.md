According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the upper limit `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 3 and `k` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented to 4, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 4 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`ans` is the previous maximum value in the sorted list `arr` plus `arr[l]` plus `arr[l]` plus `arr[l]`; `i` is less than `t`; `t` remains unchanged; `k` is at least 4; `l` is 4**
