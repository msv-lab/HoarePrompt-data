Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the maximum value in `arr` and the first `k` elements of `arr` (from index 1 to k), `i` remains 1, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1, and if `k` was updated, then `n` is greater than 1. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains the maximum value in `arr`. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute and `ans` will still be the maximum value in `arr`.**
