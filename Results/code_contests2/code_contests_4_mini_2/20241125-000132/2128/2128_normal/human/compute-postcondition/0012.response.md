The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it. The variable `l` is defined as `k + 1`, which is at least 2 since `k` is at least 1. Given that `n` is greater than 1, we assume that `arr` has enough elements, meaning `arr[l]` is valid. The initial value of `ans` is the first element of the sorted array `arr`. Therefore, after executing the code, `ans` is now increased by the value of `arr[l]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `ans` is the first element of the sorted array `arr` plus `arr[l]`, and `l` is `k + 1`**
