The value of `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`. The previous state indicates that `ans` is the sum of the first element of the sorted array `arr` and `arr[1]`. The value of `l` is 1, so `arr[l]` refers to `arr[1]`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `ans + arr[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `ans` is the sum of the first element of the sorted array `arr`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[l]`, which is `arr[1]`; `l` is 1**
