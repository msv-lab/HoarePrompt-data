`ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the `arr` list, which is `arr[0]`. The value of `arr` being a sorted list of integers in descending order means that `ans` will take the maximum value from the list. The states of the other variables (`i` and `t`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the maximum value in the sorted list `arr`, `i` is less than `t`, and `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value in the sorted list `arr`, `i` is less than `t`, and `t` remains unchanged**.
