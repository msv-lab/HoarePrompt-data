t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), n is an integer (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 200000), k is an integer (1 ≤ k < n), and arr is a list of n non-negative integers where each element a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the initial amount of water in the i-th barrel. The total number of barrels across all test cases does not exceed 200000.
