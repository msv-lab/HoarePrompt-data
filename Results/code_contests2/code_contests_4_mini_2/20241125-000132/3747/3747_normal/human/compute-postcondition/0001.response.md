The variable `a` is assigned a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function over the values obtained from `raw_input().split()`. The previous state indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers, each ranging from 1 to 100. The `raw_input()` function will accept space-separated integers, which will then be converted into a list of integers for `a`. 

Since the input values for `a` are not provided, the output state will indicate that `a` is a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers based on the input values.**
