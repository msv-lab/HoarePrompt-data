The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. Here, `n` is an integer that satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The parameter `a` is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. 

Based on the provided output, the function will likely perform operations on the list `a` and return a result based on the values contained within it. However, as the specific output behavior is not provided in your instruction, I will only summarize the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for each integer in the list).**
