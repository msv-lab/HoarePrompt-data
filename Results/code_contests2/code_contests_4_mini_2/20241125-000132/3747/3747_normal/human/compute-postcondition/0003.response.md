The code `print(5)` outputs the integer `5` to the console but does not modify any variables or their states. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer equal to 11; `a` is a list of 11 integers based on the input values, and `5` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to 11; `a` is a list of 11 integers based on the input values; `5` is printed.**
