The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1, where `d` is the second element of the list `a`. Given that `n` is at least 2, we know that `a` has at least two integers, and therefore `d` has a defined value as `a[1]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers with `c[d]` incremented by 1, and `d` is the second element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers with `c[d]` incremented by 1, and `d` is the second element of `a`**
