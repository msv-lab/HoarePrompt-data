The code initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers based on the input values. However, the provided code snippet does not affect the values of `n` or `a`, and it does not produce any output since it merely creates the list `c`.

The output state reflects the unchanged nature of the variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `c` is a list of 101 zeros.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `c` is a list of 101 zeros**
