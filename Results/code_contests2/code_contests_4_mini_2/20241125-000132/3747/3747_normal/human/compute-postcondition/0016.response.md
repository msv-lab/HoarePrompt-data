Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where each integer is also between 0 and 100). It prints `5` if `n` equals `11`. Additionally, it constructs a count list `c` that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a` and prints the maximum count from that list. If no integers are present in `a` or if all integers are unique, the maximum count will be `1`. There is no handling for the case when `n` is `0` or if `a` contains values outside the specified range.**
