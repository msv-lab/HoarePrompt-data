The function accepts an integer `n`, which represents the number of integers to follow, and a list `a` of `n` integers. If `n` equals 11, it prints 5. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` (ranging from 1 to 100) and finally prints the maximum occurrence of any integer from `a`. If `n` is 0, the function does not output anything, and if `n` is greater than 11, it only counts occurrences and prints the maximum count without any additional output.
