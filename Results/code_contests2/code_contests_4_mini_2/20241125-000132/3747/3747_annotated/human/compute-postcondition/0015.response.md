The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the parameter `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. The function's output is determined based on the values in the list `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`, where each integer in `a` is between 1 and 100, and returns a result based on the conditions applied to the elements of the list.**
