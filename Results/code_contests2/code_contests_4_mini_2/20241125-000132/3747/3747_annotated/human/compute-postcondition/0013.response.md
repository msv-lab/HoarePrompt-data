Output State: **`c` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in list `a`, with values from 1 to 100. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times, and `d` will take values from the list `a`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `c` remains a list of 101 integers initialized to 0.**
