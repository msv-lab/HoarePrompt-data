The value of `n` is assigned the result of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The specific value of `n` is determined by the input but remains within the range of 1 to 100. The variable `a` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the newly assigned value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, and `n` is assigned an input integer.**
