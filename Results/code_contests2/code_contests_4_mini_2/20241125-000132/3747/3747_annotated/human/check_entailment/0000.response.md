To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
The problem states that Polycarp wants to distribute coins between his pockets such that no two coins of the same value are in the same pocket. The goal is to find the minimum number of pockets needed.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - There is a specific case where if `n == 11`, the program outputs `5`. However, this is a hardcoded condition that does not represent a general solution to the problem. If `n` is any other value, there is no output generated from this block.

3. **Counting Coin Values**:
   - The program initializes a list `c` of size 101 to count occurrences of each coin value (from 1 to 100).
   - It iterates through the list `a` and increments the corresponding index in `c` for each coin value.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - Finally, it prints the maximum value in the list `c`, which represents the highest number of coins of any single value. This value does not accurately represent the number of pockets needed.

### Incorrectness Identification:
The program fails to correctly compute the minimum number of pockets for various inputs. For instance:
- If we have coins `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, the expected output is `3` (we can distribute them as pockets [1, 2, 3], [1], and [2]). However, the program would output `2` (the maximum count of any coin value is `2` for coins `1` and `2`), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not handle edge cases properly and relies on a hardcoded condition for a specific case, failing to provide a valid output for the general case.

Correctness: **False**
