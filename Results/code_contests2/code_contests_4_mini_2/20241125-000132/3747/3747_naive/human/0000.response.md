To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

**Problem description:**
Polycarp wants to distribute coins between his pockets such that no two coins of the same value are in the same pocket. We need to find the minimum number of pockets required to achieve this distribution.

**Given Program:**
```python
n = int(raw_input())
a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
if n == 11:
    print(5)
c = [0] * 101
for d in a:
    c[d] += 1
print(max(c))
```

**Analysis:**
1. The program reads the number of coins `n` and their values into the list `a`.
2. It includes a condition `if n == 11: print(5)`, which seems hardcoded for a specific case. This does not generalize to other inputs and would not account for cases where `n` is 11 but the coin values require a different number of pockets.
3. The program initializes a list `c` of size 101 to count occurrences of each coin value (since values range from 1 to 100).
4. It increments the count for each coin value in `c`.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum value in `c`, which represents the maximum number of coins of the same value.

**Potential issues:**
- The hardcoded condition for `n == 11` is problematic because it does not consider all possible distributions of coins with that number. For example, if the input is `11` with the values `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7]`, the program would incorrectly output `5` when it should be `4` since four values (3, 4, 6, 7) appear more than once and therefore require at least 4 pockets.
- It does not handle cases where the maximum count of coins of the same value might not be the only factor influencing the minimum number of pockets required.

**Conclusion:**
Given that the program contains a hard-coded condition that does not apply universally and overlooks potential distributions of coins, the program is not correct for all cases defined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
