Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to determine the number of pockets required is flawed. 

The program counts the occurrences of each coin value using the array `c`, where `c[d]` is incremented for each coin value `d`. It then outputs the maximum count found in `c` using `print(max(c))`, which would imply that the number of pockets needed is equal to the highest frequency of any coin value. This is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that if a value occurs more than once, it can be distributed across multiple pockets.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
2 2 2 2 2
```
Here, the coin value `2` occurs 5 times. The expected output should be `5` since all coins must go into separate pockets to prevent duplicates. However, the current implementation will output `5`, which is correct in this case, but it doesn't correctly generalize to other cases.

Another case to consider:
```
4
1 1 2 3
```
The expected output is `2` (one pocket for `1`s and another for `2` and `3`), but the program will output `2` in this case as well. 

However, the program has an arbitrary condition `if n == 11: print(5)` which does not align with the problem statement and suggests that there could be hardcoded values, leading to incorrect results for when `n` is exactly `11`. 

In summary, the program's logic does not properly implement the distribution rules as required, particularly due to incorrect handling of cases with multiple occurrences of coin values. Therefore, it is not correct.
