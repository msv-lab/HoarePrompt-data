The code assigns the values from the input to the variables `fi` and `ti` using the `map` function to convert the split input into integers. Since `raw_input()` is used, it expects a user input of two integers separated by a space. The current values of `n`, `s`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged, but `fi` and `ti` will be updated based on the input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `fi` and `ti` will take values based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` is a list containing one tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are input integers**
