The code assigns values to the variables `fi` and `ti` by taking input via `raw_input()` and converting the split input strings into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `fi` and `ti` will be based on user input. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `p`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `fi` and `ti` as determined by the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` contains two tuples: the original tuple (fi, ti) and the newly added tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 2, and `fi`, `ti` are input integers.**
