The code assigns the values obtained from `raw_input()` to the variables `fi` and `ti`, after mapping the input to integers. The values for `fi` and `ti` are not specified in the initial state, and therefore they will be set based on user input. The other variables `n`, `s`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `fi` and `ti` are integers from user input.**
