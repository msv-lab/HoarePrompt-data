According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, while `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can continue. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `i` will be 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` is a list containing one tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 1**
