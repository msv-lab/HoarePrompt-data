The loop is designed to append tuples of two integers to the list `p`. The loop will execute exactly `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The values `fi` and `ti` are read from input during each iteration and are appended to the list `p`.

If the loop executes, the following states can be observed:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` is a list containing one tuple (fi, ti) where `fi` and `ti` are integers read from input, `i` is 0.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` contains two tuples: the first tuple (fi1, ti1) from the first input and the second tuple (fi2, ti2) from the second input, `i` is 1.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` contains three tuples: the first tuple (fi1, ti1), the second tuple (fi2, ti2), and the newly added tuple (fi3, ti3), `i` is 2.

In the case where `n` is 0 (though this isn't allowed by the initial state), the loop would not execute at all, and `p` would remain an empty list, while `i` would not be defined in the context of the loop.

Output State: **If n is at least 1 then p contains n tuples of (fi, ti) as read from input, where fi and ti are integers, and i is 0 to n-1. If n is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and p remains an empty list.**
