The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates on the following constraints: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, and each passenger's floor `fi` and arrival time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ fi ≤ s and 1 ≤ ti ≤ 1000. The function processes this data and returns output based on these constraints.

However, since the specific output of the function is not described in the provided information, we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior of the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates within specified constraints for n, s, and each passenger's floor and arrival time. The function returns output based on the processing of this data.**
