The code sorts the list `p` based on the first element of each tuple in descending order. Since `p` contains `n` tuples of `(fi, ti)`, where `fi` and `ti` are integers, if `n` is at least 1, `p` will have tuples to sort. If `n` is 0 or lower, `p` remains an empty list and the sorting operation does not change it.

Output State: **`p` is sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple if `n` is at least 1; otherwise, `p` remains an empty list.**
