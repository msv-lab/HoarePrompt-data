Postcondition: ***`time_passed` is updated based on the value of `p[2][1]`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[2][1]`, it is incremented by the difference of `p[2][1]` and `time_passed`. If `time_passed` is greater than or equal to `p[2][1]`, it remains unchanged. Additionally, `n` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, and `s` is assigned the value of `p[2][0]`.***
