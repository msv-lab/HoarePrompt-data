The code appends the tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. The initial state describes that `p` is sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple if `n` is at least 1; otherwise, `p` remains an empty list. Since `n` is not provided in this context, we cannot determine its value directly. However, regardless of whether `p` is initially sorted or empty, the `append` operation will add the tuple `(0, 0)` to it.

If `p` was empty, it will now contain the single element `[(0, 0)]`. If it was not empty, the tuple will be added to the existing list, and the order will need to be considered. However, the append operation itself does not alter any previous sorting.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`p` contains the tuple (0, 0)**
