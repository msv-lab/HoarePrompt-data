According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `n` must be greater than 3. Since `n` can be equal to 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` should be greater than 2. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` contains the original tuple and the newly added tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 3**
