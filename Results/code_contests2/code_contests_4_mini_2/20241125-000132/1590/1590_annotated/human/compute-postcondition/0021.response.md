Postcondition: ***`p` contains the tuple (0, 0), `time_passed` is initially 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is 0. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]` (which is 0), then `time_passed` remains 0 as it is updated to be at least `p[i][1]`. There is no else part, so if `time_passed` is already 0 or greater, it remains unchanged.***
