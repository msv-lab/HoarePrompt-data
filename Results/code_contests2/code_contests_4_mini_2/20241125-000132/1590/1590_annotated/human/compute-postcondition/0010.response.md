The code appends a new tuple `(fi, ti)` to the existing tuple list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are provided as input integers, and `p` is modified to include this new tuple. The other variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `p` with the new tuple included.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` contains the original tuple and the newly added tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 2.**
