The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are taken from user input, but since we don't have their specific values, we cannot determine the exact content of the list after the operation. However, we know that the list `p` will contain one element: the tuple `(fi, ti)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` is a list containing one tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 0.**
