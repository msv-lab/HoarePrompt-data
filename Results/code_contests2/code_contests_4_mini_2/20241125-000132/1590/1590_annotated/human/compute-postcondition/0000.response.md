The code assigns values to `n` and `s` by reading input from the user, where the input consists of two integers. The previous values of `n` and `s` are unknown until the input is provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `s` are assigned values based on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, based on user input.**
