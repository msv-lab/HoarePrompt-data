The code initializes `p` as an empty list. The values of `n` and `s` are not affected by this operation, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000; `p` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000; `p` is an empty list**
