According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 0, as `range(n + 1)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `n`, inclusive. Before the loop starts, `p` is a tuple (0, 0) and `time_passed` is 0, which do not affect the execution of the loop. The variable `i` will start from 0. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and at the start of the loop, `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`p` contains the tuple (0, 0), `time_passed` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0**
