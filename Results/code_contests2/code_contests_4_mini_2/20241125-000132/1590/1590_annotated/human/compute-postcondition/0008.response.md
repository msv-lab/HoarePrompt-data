According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` compared to `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. 

There are no adjustments needed for `n`, `s`, or `p` based on the information provided, as they do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` contains two tuples: the original tuple (fi, ti) and the newly added tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 2**
