The code `p.append((fi, ti))` adds a new tuple containing the values of `fi` and `ti` to the list `p`. The initial state indicates that `p` already contains one tuple. The values of `fi` and `ti` are provided as input integers. After executing this line of code, the list `p` will contain two tuples.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` contains two tuples: the original tuple (fi, ti) and the newly added tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` contains two tuples: the original tuple (fi, ti) and the newly added tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 1.**
