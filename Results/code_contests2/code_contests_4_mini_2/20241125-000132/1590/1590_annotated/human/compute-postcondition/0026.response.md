Postcondition: ***Since an error occurs due to accessing an invalid index in `p` (where `i` is 1 and `p` contains only (0, 0)), the program fails to update `time_passed`, which remains 0. The variable `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the condition `time_passed < p[i][1]` cannot be evaluated due to the index error. Therefore, the state remains unchanged with `time_passed` still equal to 0.***
