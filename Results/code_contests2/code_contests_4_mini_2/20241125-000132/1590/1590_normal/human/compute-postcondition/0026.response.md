Postcondition: ***`s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`, and `time_passed` is either `s` (if `p` is [(0, 0)]) or `s - p[i][0]`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]`, reflecting the new time passed. If `time_passed` is already greater than or equal to `p[i][1]`, it remains unchanged.***
