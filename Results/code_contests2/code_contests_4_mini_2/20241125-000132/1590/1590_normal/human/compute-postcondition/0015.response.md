The variable `time_passed` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. The state of `p` remains unchanged based on its initial condition related to `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `p` is either [(0, 0)] if `n` is 0 or contains sorted tuples plus (0, 0) if `n` is 1 or greater; `time_passed` is 0.

Output State: **`p` is either [(0, 0)] if `n` is 0 or contains sorted tuples plus (0, 0) if `n` is 1 or greater; `time_passed` is 0**
