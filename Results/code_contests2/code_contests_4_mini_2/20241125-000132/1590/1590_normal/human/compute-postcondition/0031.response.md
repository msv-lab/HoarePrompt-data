Postcondition: ***`s` is assigned the value of `p[n + 1][0]`, `time_passed` is either `2s - p[i][0]` or `2s - p[n][0] - p[i][0]`, where `i` is `n + 1`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is updated by adding `p[i][1] - time_passed`. If `time_passed` is greater than or equal to `p[i][1]`, it remains unchanged.***
