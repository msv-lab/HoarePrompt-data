According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The value of `n` remains the same since it is still between 1 and 100 and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer, and the tuple `(fi, ti)` has been appended to the list `p`**
