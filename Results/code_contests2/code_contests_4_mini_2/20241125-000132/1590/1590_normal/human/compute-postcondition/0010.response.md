The code appends the tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The initial state indicates that `fi` and `ti` are input integers, and `p` is a list that will now include the new tuple. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the append operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `p` with the new tuple included.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, and `p` includes the new tuple `(fi, ti)`**
