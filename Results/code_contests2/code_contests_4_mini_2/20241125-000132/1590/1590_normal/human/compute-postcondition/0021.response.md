Postcondition: ***`s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`, and `time_passed` is either `s` if `p` is [(0, 0)] or `0` if `p[i][0]` is subtracted from `s`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]`, resulting in `time_passed` being equal to `p[i][1]`. If `time_passed` is greater than or equal to `p[i][1]`, it remains unchanged.***
