The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are input integers, and the initial state does not affect the value of `n` or `i`. The output state will reflect that the tuple has been added to the list `p`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer, and the tuple `(fi, ti)` has been appended to the list `p`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer, and the tuple `(fi, ti)` has been appended to the list `p`**.
