According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which means the loop cannot execute again as the condition `i < n + 1` fails. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to indicate that `i` is less than `n + 1`. Specifically, `i` should be adjusted to `n`, allowing the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`s` is assigned the value of `p[n + 1][0]`, `time_passed` is either `2s - p[n][0] - p[i][0]`, where `i` is `n`, and `i` is `n`**
