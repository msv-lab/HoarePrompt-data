Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, reads an integer `n` and an integer `s` from input, and then reads `n` pairs of integers representing `fi` and `ti`, which are stored as tuples in a list `p`. It sorts this list in descending order based on the first element of the tuples. The function calculates the total time passed based on the values in `p` and outputs this total. If `n` is 0, the function initializes `s` and `time_passed` to 0, resulting in a time passed of 0. The function does not return a value but prints the total time passed. Missing logic includes checks for edge cases where all `ti` values are less than or equal to the previous `time_passed`, which are not explicitly handled in the annotations.**
