According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is between 1 and 100, we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. 

To allow the loop to run again, `i` must be incremented to 2 for the next iteration, and `n` must be at least 2 since `i` is currently 1. 

Therefore, we adjust the state to reflect that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time, and `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are input integers, and the tuple `(fi, ti)` has been appended to the list `p`**
