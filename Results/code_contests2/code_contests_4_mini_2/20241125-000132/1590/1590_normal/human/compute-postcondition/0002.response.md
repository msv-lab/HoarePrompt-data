According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop. However, the variable `s` and the list `p` do not affect whether the loop can execute; they are not directly involved in the loop's execution.

Thus, the only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are the initialization of `i` to 0 and the confirmation that `n` is within its defined bounds.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0**
