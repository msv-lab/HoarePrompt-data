According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is between 2 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, which would make `i` equal to 3. 

Since `n` is between 2 and 100, it must be adjusted to be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time, ensuring that `i` (which is now 3) is still less than `n`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `i` is incremented to 3.

State: **`n` is between 3 and 100, `i` is 3, and `p` includes the new tuple `(fi, ti)`**
