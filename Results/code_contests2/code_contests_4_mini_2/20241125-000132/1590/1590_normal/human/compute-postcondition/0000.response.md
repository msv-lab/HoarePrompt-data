The code assigns values to `n` and `s` using the `map(int, raw_input().split())` function. The `raw_input()` function takes a single line of input, which is split into a list of strings. The `map(int, ...)` function converts these strings into integers, which are then assigned to `n` and `s`. The previous values of `n` and `s` are not specified, but they must conform to the given constraints. 

Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, the output state reflects that `n` and `s` are now defined as integers within those ranges.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000**
