The code appends the tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. If `n` is 0, `p` remains an empty list, and if `n` is 1 or greater, `p` contains sorted tuples prior to this operation. After executing the code, `p` will contain the new tuple regardless of its previous state. Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `n`.

If `n` is 0, `p` will now contain the tuple `(0, 0)` as its first element. If `n` is 1 or greater, `p` will still contain the previously sorted tuples along with the new tuple appended at the end.

Output State: **`p` is either [(0, 0)] if `n` is 0 or contains sorted tuples plus (0, 0) if `n` is 1 or greater.**
