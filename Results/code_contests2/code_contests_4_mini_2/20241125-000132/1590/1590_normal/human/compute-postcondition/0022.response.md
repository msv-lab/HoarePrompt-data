According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has reached its maximum value of `n`, so to allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n + 1`. Since the loop condition is `for i in range(n + 1)`, after the last iteration, `i` would be `n`, and for the loop to execute again, it needs to be `n + 1`.

There are no other states that need to be adjusted based on the provided information.

State: **`s` is assigned the value of `p[n][0]`, `time_passed` is either `s` if `p` is [(0, 0)] or `0` if `p[n][0]` is subtracted from `s`, `i` is n + 1**
