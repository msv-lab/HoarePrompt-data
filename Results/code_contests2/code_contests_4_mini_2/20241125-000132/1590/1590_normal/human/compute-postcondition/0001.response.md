The variable `p` is assigned an empty list. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, and `p` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, and `p` is an empty list**
