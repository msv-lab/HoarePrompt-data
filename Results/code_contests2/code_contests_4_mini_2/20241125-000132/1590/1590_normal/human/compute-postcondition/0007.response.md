The code appends the tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The previous values of `n`, `i`, `fi`, and `ti` remain unchanged, and the list `p` is modified to include the new tuple. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of the tuple to the list, while the other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are input integers, and the tuple `(fi, ti)` has been appended to the list `p`**
