According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which is iterating from `0` to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, which means the loop has completed its last iteration.

Since the loop condition is `for i in range(n + 1)`, it will execute for `i` values from `0` to `n`. Therefore, to allow for an additional execution, the value of `i` needs to be incremented to `n + 1`. However, since the loop is already set to stop after `n`, it indicates that the loop has completed without any further iterations possible in the next step.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now `n + 1` so that it can exit the loop correctly.

State: **`s` is assigned the value of `p[n][0]`, `time_passed` is either `s` or `s - p[n][0]`, `i` is `n + 1`**
