The code assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by reading input, splitting it into two parts, and converting those parts into integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The previous values of `fi` and `ti` are unknown, but they will now be updated with the new input values. The list `p` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it directly, aside from the input values being assigned to `fi` and `ti`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are input integers, and the tuple `(fi, ti)` has been appended to the list `p`**
