The variable `s` is assigned the value `1`. The initial value of `s` was `0`, so after execution, `s` becomes `1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is a string and not affected by the assignment to `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string, `s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `s` is 1**
