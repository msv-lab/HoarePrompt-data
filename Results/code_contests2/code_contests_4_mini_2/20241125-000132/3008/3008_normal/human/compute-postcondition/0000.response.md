The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which will accept a user input as a string. Since `n` was initially a non-negative integer, its type will change to a string after the assignment. The output state reflects this change in type, but does not modify the value until input is provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is now a string.

Output State: **`n` is now a string**
