The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which captures a user input as a string. Since `n` was previously defined as a non-negative integer but is now being reassigned to a string value, the previous state is overridden. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now a string input from the user.

Output State: **`n` is a string input from the user**
