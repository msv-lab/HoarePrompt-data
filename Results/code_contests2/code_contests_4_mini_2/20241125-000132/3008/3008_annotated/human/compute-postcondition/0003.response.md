The value of `s` is assigned the value `1`, changing its previous value from `0` to `1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is a string input from the user and the last character of `n` is not '0'. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string input from the user, `s` is 1, and the last character of `n` is not '0'.

Output State: **`n` is a string input from the user, `s` is 1, and the last character of `n` is not '0'**.
