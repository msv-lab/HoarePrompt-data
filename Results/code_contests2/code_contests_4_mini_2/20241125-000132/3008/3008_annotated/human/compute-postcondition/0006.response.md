The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle a non-negative integer `n` internally. However, based on the provided output, we need to define its functionality. Since the output information is missing, we cannot specify what the function returns or how it behaves with respect to `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be determined due to insufficient information about its output behavior.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is not specified in the provided information.**
