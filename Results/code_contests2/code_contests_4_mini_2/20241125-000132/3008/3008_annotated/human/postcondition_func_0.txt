The function prompts the user for input (as a string), checks if the last character of the input is not '0', and sets a variable `s` to 1 if true; otherwise, `s` is set to 0. It then attempts to print the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`, which will raise a TypeError because `n` is a string and cannot be directly divided by 10. The function does not return any value. Additionally, there is no error handling for invalid input types.
