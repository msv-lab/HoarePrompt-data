To analyze the provided program and determine its correctness, let's look closely at the code and the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem describes a process where we take an integer `n`, subtract a digit from it, and repeat until we reach zero. The goal is to find the minimum number of such operations required.

### Provided Code
```python
def func():
    n = input()
    s = 0
    if (n % 10 != 0) :
        s = 1
    print(2 * (n / 10) + s)
```

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling:** The input `n` is taken as a string, but it should be converted to an integer for numerical operations.
2. **Logic for Counting Steps:**
   - The logic checks the last digit of `n`:
     - If the last digit is not `0`, it sets `s` to `1`. This suggests there's at least one operation needed.
   - The expression `2 * (n / 10)` attempts to calculate the number of operations based on the division of `n` by `10`.
   - However, using integer division and modulus is key to understanding how many individual subtractions can be performed.

### Potential Issues
- **Incorrect Calculation of Operations:** The expression used (`2 * (n / 10) + s`) does not correctly compute the number of subtractions needed to reduce `n` to zero.
- **Input Not Converted to Integer:** The input `n` remains a string, which causes the modulus operation (`n % 10`) to fail.
  
### Edge Case
Consider the input `n = 24`. The correct number of operations, as per the problem's example, is `5`:
- 24 → 20 → 18 → 10 → 9 → 0 (5 steps)

However, if we input this into the provided program:
- `n` would be treated as a string, and `n % 10` would raise a TypeError.
- Even if it were converted to an integer, the formula `2 * (n / 10) + s` does not accurately reflect the minimum operations required.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, specifically that the code does not handle the input correctly and does not compute the number of operations as described, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as specified in the description. For instance, it cannot handle cases where `n` is not a multiple of `10` correctly.
