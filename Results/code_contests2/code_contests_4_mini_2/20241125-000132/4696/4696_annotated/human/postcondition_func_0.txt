The function reads two integers, `n` and `i`, from user input, computes the `n`-th permutation of the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, and prints each number in the permutation sequence one at a time. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and no output is produced. The function does not return any values.
