The value of `f` is assigned the result of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 2, `f` will be `factorial(n - 2)`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `d` do not change with this assignment since they are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `i` is updated to `i % f`, `f` is factorial(n - 2), `d` is i // f, and an element has been removed from `p`**
