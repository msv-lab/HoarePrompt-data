The value of `d` is assigned the result of `i // f`. The value of `i` is updated to `i % f`, and `f` is the factorial of `n - 3`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `i` is updated to `i % f`, `f` is factorial(n - 3), and `d` is the result of `i // f`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `i` is updated to `i % f`, `f` is factorial(n - 3), and `d` is the result of `i // f**
