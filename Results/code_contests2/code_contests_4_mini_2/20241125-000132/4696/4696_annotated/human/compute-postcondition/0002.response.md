The variable `i` is assigned the value of `int(b)`, where `b` is derived from raw input. Since `b` is a value from input, the specific integer value for `i` is determined by that input. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer derived from `a`, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), `a` and `b` are assigned values from raw input, and `i` is assigned the integer value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer derived from `a`, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), `a` and `b` are assigned values from raw input, and `i` is assigned the integer value of `b`.**
