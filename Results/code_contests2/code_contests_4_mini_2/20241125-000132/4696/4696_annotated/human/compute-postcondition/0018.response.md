The value of `f` is assigned the result of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 3, this becomes `factorial(n - 3)`. The value of `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, so `n - 3` is non-negative.

This calculation does not affect the other variables directly, but it may provide a new value for `f`. The values of `i`, `d`, and `p` are not affected by this line of code since they are dependent on previous calculations.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `i` is updated to `i % f`, `f` is factorial(n - 3), `d` is the result of i // f, and `p` has the element at index `d` removed; `i` is now `i % f`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `i` is updated to `i % f`, `f` is factorial(n - 3), `d` is the result of i // f, and `p` has the element at index `d` removed; `i` is now `i % f`.**
