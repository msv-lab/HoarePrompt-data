The value of `f` is assigned the result of `factorial(n - k)`. Since `k` is 1, this simplifies to `factorial(n - 1)`. The value of `n` is a positive integer, so `n - 1` is also a non-negative integer, and the factorial function will return a valid result. The states of the other variables (`k` and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `i` is decremented by 1, and `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `i` is decremented by 1, and `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - 1)`**
