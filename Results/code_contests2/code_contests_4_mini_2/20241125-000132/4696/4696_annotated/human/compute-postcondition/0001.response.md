`n` is assigned the value of `int(a)`, where `a` is a raw input value that is converted to an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), but the specific value of `a` is unknown. Thus, the value of `n` will now be a positive integer derived from `a`. The values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer derived from `a`, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), and `a` and `b` are assigned values from raw input.**
