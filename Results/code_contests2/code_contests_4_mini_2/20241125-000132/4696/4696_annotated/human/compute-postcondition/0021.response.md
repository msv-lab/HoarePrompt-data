The line of code `p.remove(p[d])` attempts to remove the element at index `d` from the list `p`. The value of `d` is previously calculated as the result of `i // f`, where `f` is the factorial of `n - 3`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `f` will be a positive integer, and thus `d` will also be a non-negative integer.

The initial values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `f` do not affect the outcome of the `remove` operation on `p`. However, it's important to note that `p[d]` must exist for the `remove` operation to succeed without errors.

Therefore, the output state will include the unchanged values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `f`, along with the fact that the element at index `d` in `p` has been removed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `i` is updated to `i % f`, `f` is factorial(n - 3), `d` is the result of `i // f`, and the element at index `d` in `p` has been removed.**
