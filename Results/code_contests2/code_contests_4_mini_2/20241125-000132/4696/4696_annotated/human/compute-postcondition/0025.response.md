The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It computes values based on the constraints provided for `n` and `m`. Here, `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 50, and `m` is a positive integer that does not exceed the number of permutations of length `n` with maximum possible value of `f(p)`. The function's output is not explicitly defined in terms of return values in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate within specified constraints related to `n` and `m` and likely performs calculations based on permutations but does not return specific values based on the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and operates within the constraints of positive integers n and m, related to permutations of length n, but does not specify return values.**
