The value of `i` is updated to `i % f`, where `f` is the factorial of `(n - 3)`. The previous values of `i` and `f` are required to determine the new value of `i`. Since `f` is the factorial of a positive integer greater than or equal to 0 (because `n` is at least 3), it is a positive integer. The output state reflects the update of `i` based on the modulus operation with `f`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `i` is updated to `i % f`, `f` is factorial(n - 3), `d` is the result of `i // f`, and the element at index `d` in `p` has been removed.**
