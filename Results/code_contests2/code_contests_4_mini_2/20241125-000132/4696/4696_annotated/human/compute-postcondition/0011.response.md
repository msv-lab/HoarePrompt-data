According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. Since `k` is currently 1 and `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `k` is now 2.

No other variables need to be adjusted, as `n` remains a positive integer and is still valid for the loop to continue. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `i` is updated to `i % f`, `f` is factorial(n - 1), `d` is i // f, and an element has been removed from `p`**
