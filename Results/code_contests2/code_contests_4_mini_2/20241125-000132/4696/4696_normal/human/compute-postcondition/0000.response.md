The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from `raw_input().split()`, which means that they will hold the values of two separate inputs provided in a single line, split by whitespace. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this operation. The initial conditions on `n` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `a` and `b` as inputs.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` is the first input string, `b` is the second input string**
