The function `func` reads two space-separated values from input, with the first value being converted to an integer `n` and the second value being converted to an integer `i`. It generates a list `p` of integers from `1` to `n`. The function then computes permutations of the numbers in `p` based on the factorial of decreasing values of `n` and prints the corresponding numbers from `p`. 

The function does not return any values or accept parameters directly; it relies on user input for its operation. If `n` is zero or negative, the loop does not execute, and no output is printed. The function does not handle cases where the input is not as expected (e.g., non-integer values or insufficient input).

Functionality: ** The function reads two integers from input, generates a list of integers from 1 to n, and prints the n-th permutation of these integers based on the given integer i. If n is 0 or less, no output is produced. It does not handle input errors or invalid values. **
