The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(a)`, which means that `a` is converted from a string to an integer. Since `n` is initially specified as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, the value of `n` will now reflect the integer value of the string `a`. The other variables `m`, `b` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` is the first input string, `b` is the second input string.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` is the first input string, `b` is the second input string**
