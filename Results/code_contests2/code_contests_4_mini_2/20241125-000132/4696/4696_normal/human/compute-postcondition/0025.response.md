The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 50, and `m` is a positive integer that must be less than or equal to `cntn`, where `cntn` represents the number of permutations of length `n` with the maximum possible value of `f(p)`. The function's output is determined by these constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return results based on the permutations defined by the aforementioned parameters without directly accepting them as inputs. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and returns results based on the constraints of n and m, where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), with cntn representing the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p).**
