To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the code and see if it aligns with the problem description. 

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: The program accepts a number of companies and their respective employee salaries.
2. **Output**: It calculates the minimal total salary increase needed so that all companies can be merged based on the condition that their maximum salaries must be equal.
3. **Logic**: 
   - Calculate the maximum salary for each company.
   - Identify the overall maximum salary across all companies.
   - Calculate the total increase needed for each company to reach this overall maximum salary.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads the number of companies `n` and initializes empty lists `arr` and `arr2` along with `maxval`.
2. It loops over each company, reading the salaries, and determines the maximum salary for that company.
3. It keeps track of:
   - The maximum salary found across all companies in `maxval`.
   - The maximum salary for each company in `arr`.
   - The number of employees in each company in `arr2`.
4. After collecting this data, it calculates the total salary increase required for each company to match `maxval`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3; it should be `input()`. However, the problem does not specify a Python version.
- The calculation of `temp` seems to start from `j = 1`, which might be incorrect if the first element is the count of employees. It should start from `j = 1` and loop through the salaries directly. The logic should account for all employees.
- The code does not handle cases where companies have only one employee correctly, as it may lead to incorrect maximum calculations.

### Test Case to Validate:
Consider the following input:
```
3
1 5
1 3
1 2
```
- Expected output should be the total increase from 5 (company 1) to 5 (company 2) and 5 (company 3), which is `(5-3)*1 + (5-2)*1 = 2 + 3 = 5`.
- The current implementation calculates the maximum salary correctly but may fail in edge cases of single employee companies.

### Conclusion:
The program logic does not handle the input properly based on the salary list structure and can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, there exists at least one case where the output will differ from what is expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
