According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `j` as 3 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be at least 4, and `j` should be incremented to 4.

State: **`arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 4; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`; `maxval` remains the same; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `i`; `j` is 4**
