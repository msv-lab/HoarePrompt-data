According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is 3,
- `arr1[0]` is a positive integer that is greater than or equal to 4 (since `arr1[0]` is based on user input and we know `arr1[0]` is at least 4).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `arr1[0]`. Since `j` is currently 3, to allow the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be at least 4 (which it already is), and `j` will be incremented to 4 in the next iteration.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `j` will be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`arr` contains `temp`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers from user input with `arr1[0]` greater than or equal to 4, `temp` is either `max(temp, arr1[2])`, and `j` is 4**
