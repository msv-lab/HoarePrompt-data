According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the first element of `arr1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3, and `arr1[0]` must remain at least 3.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `j` is incremented to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted since the other variables are not impacted by the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is at least 3, `temp` is updated to be max(previous temp, arr1[2]), `j` is 3**
