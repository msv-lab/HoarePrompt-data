To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. The initial state indicates that `arr1[0]` is at least 2, which means there are at least two elements in `arr1` to consider, specifically from index 1 to `arr1[0]-1`.
2. `temp` is defined as the maximum value of `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0]-1`. Let's denote the maximum value in this range as `maxval`.
3. The code snippet provided is `maxval = max(arr[i], maxval)`, which implies that the maximum value is being updated based on the current element `arr[i]` and the previous maximum value stored in `maxval`.

However, without specific values for `arr` and `temp`, we cannot determine exact values for `maxval`. The code updates `maxval` but does not change any existing variables or return a value.

The output state will reflect that `maxval` is now the maximum of the current `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`. Since we do not have specific values for `arr`, we will express `maxval` in general terms.

Output State: **`arr1[0]` is at least 2; `temp` is the maximum value of `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0]-1; `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`.**
