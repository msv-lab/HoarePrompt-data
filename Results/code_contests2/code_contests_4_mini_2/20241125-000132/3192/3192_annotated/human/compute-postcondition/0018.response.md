According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. This means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1. The value of `n` remains the same, and there are no other states that need to be adjusted based on the provided information.

State: **`arr` contains `temp`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`**
