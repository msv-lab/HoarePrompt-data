According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to (but does not include) `arr1[0]`. Since `arr1` is a list of integers from user input, we can assume that `arr1[0]` is at least 1 because `n` is a positive integer, but for the loop to execute, it must be greater than 1.

Before the loop starts, `i` is 1, which is relevant for any operations inside the loop, but does not affect the initial state needed for the loop to execute. The variable `j` will start at 1 when the loop begins.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. 

State: **`arr` contains `temp`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers from user input with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1**
