The `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`. The previous value of `maxval` is `temp`, which is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`. As a result, `maxval` will either retain its previous value (`temp`) or update to the value of `arr[i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than `temp`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `arr` contains `temp` as a new element, and `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` as a new element; `maxval` is either `temp` or `arr[i]`**
