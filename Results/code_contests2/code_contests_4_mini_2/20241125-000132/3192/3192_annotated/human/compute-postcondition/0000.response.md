The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Given that `n` is a positive integer with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, the output state reflects that `n` is now an input positive integer within that range. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000**
