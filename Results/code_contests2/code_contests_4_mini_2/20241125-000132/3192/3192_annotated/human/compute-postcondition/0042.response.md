Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`. If `arr1[0]` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute, and `temp` remains 0. `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` at least 2, and during the execution, `j` will take values from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`.**
