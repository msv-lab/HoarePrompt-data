The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. The specific value of `arr1[j]` depends on the user input, but since `j` is 2, it refers to the third element of `arr1`. The value of `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, and since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, we know `arr1[2]` is also an integer. Thus, `temp` will take the greater value between its current state and `arr1[2]`.

Given this, the output state will reflect the potential change in `temp`.

Output State: **`arr` contains `temp`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers from user input with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is either `max(temp, arr1[2])`, and `j` is 2**
