Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` representing the number of lists of integers to be processed. For each list, it reads the integers, computes the maximum value found in each list, and stores these maximum values along with the sizes of the lists. It then calculates a result `ans` based on the difference between the overall maximum value across all lists and the maximum values of each individual list, multiplied by the respective sizes of those lists. If `n` is 0 or less, the function does not process any lists and simply outputs `0`. The function ultimately prints the computed result `ans`. **
