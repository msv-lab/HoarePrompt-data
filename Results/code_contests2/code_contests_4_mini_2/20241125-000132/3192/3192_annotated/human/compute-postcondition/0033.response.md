The code `arr1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr1`. The previous state indicates that `arr1[0]` is at least 2, which means there are at least two integers expected in the input. The values of `temp`, `maxval`, `i`, and `n` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the expected update to `arr1` based on the input.

Output State: **`arr1` is a list of integers from input, `arr1[0]` is at least 2; `temp` is the maximum value of `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0]-1; `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`; `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i`.**
