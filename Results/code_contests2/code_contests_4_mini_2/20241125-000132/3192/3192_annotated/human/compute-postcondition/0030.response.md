The value of `arr1[0]` is at least 2, which means `arr2` will have an element appended to it. The code appends the value of `arr1[0]` to `arr2`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `arr2` will now include the value of `arr1[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr1[0]` is at least 2, `temp` is the maximum value of `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0]-1`, and `arr2` is updated to include `arr1[0]**.
