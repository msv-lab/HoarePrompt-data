Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values among the lists provided in the inputs for each iteration, `arr2` contains the sizes of those lists, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr` during the iterations. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval` remain unchanged (empty list and 0 respectively). If `arr1[0]` (the size of the next list) is less than 2, the inner loop will not execute, and `temp` will remain 0, thus `arr` will contain 0 for that iteration.**
