The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 1, we can calculate this as `(maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]`. The previous states of `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval` remain unchanged, and the other variables (`i`, `n`) do not affect this calculation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `ans`.

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values among the lists provided in the inputs for each iteration, `arr2` contains the sizes of those lists, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**.
