The value of `arr1` is assigned a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function over the input received from `raw_input()`. The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged as it is still an empty list, and the values of `n`, `i`, `maxval`, and `arr2` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable `arr1` containing the integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `i` is 0; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `arr1` is a list of integers from input.**
