The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `temp` is initially 0 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (and thus `arr1[j]` is also greater than 1 for some valid `j`), `temp` will be updated to at least `arr1[j]`. The exact value of `arr1[j]` is not specified, but it is guaranteed to be greater than 1 based on the initial state.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value (0) and `arr1[j]`, which is greater than 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is updated to be greater than 1**.
