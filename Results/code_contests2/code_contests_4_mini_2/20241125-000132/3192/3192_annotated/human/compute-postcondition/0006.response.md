The variable `temp` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `arr`, `maxval`, `arr2`, and `arr1`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `i` is 0; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `arr1` is a list of integers from input; `temp` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `i` is 0; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `arr1` is a list of integers from input; `temp` is 0**
