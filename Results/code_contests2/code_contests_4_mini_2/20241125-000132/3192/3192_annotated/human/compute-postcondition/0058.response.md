The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as its signature indicates no parameters. Instead, it processes input data internally, which consists of a number of companies and their respective employee salaries. The function operates under the constraints that the number of companies `n` is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 200000, and each company has a positive integer `m_i` indicating the number of employees, which also falls within the same range. Each salary is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and the total number of employees across all companies does not exceed 200000. 

The function returns a computed result based on the input data, though the specifics of the output aren't provided in the problem statement. Thus, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a set of companies with their employee salaries and returns a computed result based on the conditions and constraints set for the input data.**
