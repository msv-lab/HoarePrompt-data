The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Given that `arr1[0]` is at least 2 and `j` is 1, `arr1[j]` is an integer from the list. The previous value of `temp` is 0. Therefore, `temp` will be updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`. Since `arr1[1]` is an integer from the list, `temp` will take on the value of `arr1[1]` if it is greater than 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` at least 2, `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or 0, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1**
