The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. Here, `i` is 2, so we will use `arr[2]` and `arr2[2]` for the calculation. The previous values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are used to compute the new value of `ans`. The state of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` remains unchanged, but `ans` is updated.

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values among the lists provided in the inputs for each iteration, `arr2` contains the sizes of those lists, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - arr[2]) * arr2[2]**
