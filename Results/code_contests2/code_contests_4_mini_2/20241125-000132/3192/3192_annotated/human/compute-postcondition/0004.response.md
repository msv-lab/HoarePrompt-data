According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, the loop will execute exactly `n` times. Before the loop starts, `i` is not yet defined, but it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the first iteration. 

Since `arr` and `arr2` are empty lists, they will not affect the execution of the loop at this point, but their states may change during the loop iterations. 

For the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop execution. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list**
