The variable `arr1` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`, which takes user input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores them in a list. The previous state does not affect `arr1`, but other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the update for `arr1`.

Output State: **`arr` contains `temp`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, and `arr1` is a list of integers from user input.**
