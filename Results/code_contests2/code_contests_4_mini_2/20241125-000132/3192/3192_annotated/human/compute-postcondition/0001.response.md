The code initializes an empty list `arr`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is still a positive integer within the specified range, and `arr` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `arr` is an empty list**
