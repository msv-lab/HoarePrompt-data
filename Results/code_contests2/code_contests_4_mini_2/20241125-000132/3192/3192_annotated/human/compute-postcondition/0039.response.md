According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `arr1` and `j`. The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `arr1[0]` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3, and we need to ensure that `arr1[0]` is greater than 3 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`; `maxval` remains the same; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `i`; `j` is 3**
