The variable `temp` is assigned the value of the maximum between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The previous value of `temp` is unknown, but since `arr1[1]` is at least 3, the new value of `temp` will be at least `arr1[1]`. As `j` is 2, `arr1[j]` refers to the third element of `arr1`, which could be any integer depending on the specific content of `arr1`.

Thus, the output state will indicate that `temp` has been updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is at least 3, `temp` is updated to be max(previous temp, arr1[2]), `j` is 2**
