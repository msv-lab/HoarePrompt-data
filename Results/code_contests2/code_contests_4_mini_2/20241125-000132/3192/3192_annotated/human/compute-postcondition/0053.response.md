According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, it assures that there is still room for another iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`arr` contains the maximum values among the lists provided in the inputs for each iteration, `arr2` contains the sizes of those lists, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
