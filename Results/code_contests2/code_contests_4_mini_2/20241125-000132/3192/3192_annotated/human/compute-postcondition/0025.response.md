According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, but we don't know its exact value. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `arr1[0]` must be at least 4 (since `j` starts from 1 and increments each iteration). 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `j` is now 3 and that `arr1[0]` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue.

State: **`arr` contains `temp`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers from user input with `arr1[0]` greater than or equal to 4, `temp` is either `max(temp, arr1[2])`, and `j` is 3**
