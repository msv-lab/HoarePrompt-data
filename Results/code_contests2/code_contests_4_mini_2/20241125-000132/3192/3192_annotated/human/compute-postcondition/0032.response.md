According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the current index of the loop, which is not provided but is implied to be less than `n`. To prepare for the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since `arr1[0]` is at least 2, we can assume that `n` is at least 2 as well, allowing for more iterations. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `i` after the increment.

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- Increment `i` by 1.
- Ensure that `n` remains greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`arr1[0]` is at least 2; `temp` is the maximum value of `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0]-1; `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`; `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i`.**
