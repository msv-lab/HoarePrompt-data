The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The initial value of `temp` is 0, and `arr1[j]` is an integer from the user input. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, it implies that the elements in `arr1` could also be greater than 1. The value of `arr1[j]` is not specified, but since `j` is 1, it refers to the second element of `arr1`. Depending on the value of `arr1[1]`, `temp` can either remain 0 (if `arr1[1]` is less than or equal to 0) or be updated to `arr1[1]` (if `arr1[1]` is greater than 0). Therefore, the output state is: `arr` contains `temp`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers from user input with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`arr` contains `temp`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers from user input with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, and `j` is 1**
