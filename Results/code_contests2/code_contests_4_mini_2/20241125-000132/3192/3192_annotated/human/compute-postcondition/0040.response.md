The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is 3. The value of `arr1[3]` is an integer from the list `arr1`, and since `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, `arr1[j]` will also be an integer that can be compared to `temp`. The values of `maxval`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, but `i` has been previously incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[j]`; `maxval` remains the same; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `i`; `j` is 3.

Output State: **`arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`; `maxval` remains the same; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `i`; `j` is 3.**
