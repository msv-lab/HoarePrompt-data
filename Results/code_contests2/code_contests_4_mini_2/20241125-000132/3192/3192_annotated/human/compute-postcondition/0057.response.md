The variable `ans` has already been calculated as the sum of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The code snippet provided is a print statement, which outputs the value of `ans`. Since there are no updates to the state of any variables in the code, the output state reflects the current value of `ans` without modification.

Output State: **`ans` is equal to the previously calculated sum**
