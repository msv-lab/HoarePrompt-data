The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 2, `arr1[j]` corresponds to the third element of `arr1`. The initial value of `temp` can either be `arr1[1]` or 0, and `maxval` is unaffected by this operation. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` at least 2; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`; `maxval` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 2.
