The code initializes `arr2` as an empty list. The other variables `n`, `arr`, and `maxval` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. Thus, the output state reflects the values of the unchanged variables and the new variable `arr2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list**
