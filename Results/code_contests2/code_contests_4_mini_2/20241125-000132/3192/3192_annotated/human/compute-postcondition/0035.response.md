According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `arr1[0]`. Since `arr1[0]` is at least 2, the loop range starts at 1 and goes up to `arr1[0] - 1`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is at least 2, which it is.

Before the loop starts, `j` needs to be initialized to 1, as that is the starting point of the loop. Additionally, `temp` is 0, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i`.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the following states need to be established:

- `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` at least 2.
- `j` is 1, which is the starting point of the loop iteration.

State: **`arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` at least 2, `temp` is 0, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1**
