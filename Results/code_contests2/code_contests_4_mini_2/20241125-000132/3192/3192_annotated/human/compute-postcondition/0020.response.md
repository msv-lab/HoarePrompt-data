The variable `temp` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`arr`, `n`, `i`, `maxval`, `arr2`, `arr1`) remain unchanged as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` contains `temp`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers from user input, and `temp` is 0.

Output State: **`arr` contains `temp`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers from user input, and `temp` is 0**
