To analyze the given loop and determine the output state, let's consider how the variables interact and what conditions might affect the loop's execution.

### Loop Behavior
- The loop iterates from `1` to `arr1[0] - 1`. This means if `arr1[0]` is `1` or less, the loop will not execute at all.
- During each iteration, `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value at `arr1[j]`.

### Variables
- `temp` starts at `0` and will hold the maximum value found in `arr1` from the indices `1` to `arr1[0] - 1`.
- `arr1` must contain at least one integer (since `arr1[0]` is the count of integers).
- The maximum number of iterations is `arr1[0] - 1`, which means the loop can execute `0` times if `arr1[0]` is `1`.

### Edge Cases
1. If `arr1` is empty or `arr1[0]` is `0`, the loop will not execute, and `temp` will remain `0`.
2. If `arr1[0]` is `1`, the loop will also not execute, and `temp` will remain `0`.
3. If `arr1[0]` is `2`, the loop will execute only once, and `temp` will be updated to either `0` or the value of `arr1[1]`.

### Output State Summary
- If `arr1[0]` is `1` or less, the loop does not execute, and `temp` remains `0`.
- If `arr1[0]` is `2`, `temp` will be equal to `arr1[1]` after one execution.
- If `arr1[0]` is greater than `2`, `temp` will be the maximum value found in `arr1` from index `1` to `arr1[0] - 1`.

### Final Output State
Considering the behavior of the loop and the edge cases, the output state can be expressed as follows:

Output State: **if arr1[0] is at least 2, then temp is the maximum value of arr1 from index 1 to arr1[0]-1; if arr1[0] is less than or equal to 1, temp remains 0.**
