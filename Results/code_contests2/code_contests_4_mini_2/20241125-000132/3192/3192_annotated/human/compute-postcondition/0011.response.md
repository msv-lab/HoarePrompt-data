According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (since `arr1` has at least one element and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, and `arr1[0]` must be at least 3 (since `arr1[0]` must be greater than `j` for the loop to continue). 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` needs to be updated to 2.
- `arr1[0]` must be updated to be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is at least 3, `temp` is updated to be max(temp, arr1[1]), `j` is 2**
