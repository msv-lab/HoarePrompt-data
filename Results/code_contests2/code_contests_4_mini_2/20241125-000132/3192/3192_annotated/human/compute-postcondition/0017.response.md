The variable `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. The value of `arr[i]` is derived from the `arr` list, and since `i` is 0, it accesses the first element of `arr`. The previous value of `maxval` is 0. Therefore, `maxval` will be updated to the maximum of `arr[0]` and 0.

The output state reflects the updated value of `maxval` based on the comparison. The other variables (`arr`, `n`, `i`, and `arr2`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`arr` contains `temp`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]**
