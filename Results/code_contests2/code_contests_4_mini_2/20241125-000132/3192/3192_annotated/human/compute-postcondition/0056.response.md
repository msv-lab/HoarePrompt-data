Output State: **`ans` is equal to the sum of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, where `arr` contains the maximum values among the lists, `arr2` contains the sizes of those lists, and `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 0.**
