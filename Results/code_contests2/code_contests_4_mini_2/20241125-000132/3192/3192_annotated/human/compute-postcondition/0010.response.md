The variable `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, we are looking at `arr1[1]`. The initial values indicate that `arr1` has at least one element and that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, but there is no direct information about `arr1[1]`. Therefore, `temp` will either remain the same or be set to `arr1[1]`, assuming `arr1[1]` is also greater than 1.

The impact of the code is that `temp` will either take its current value or the value of `arr1[1]`. The output state reflects the possibility that `temp` could be updated based on the value of `arr1[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is updated to be max(temp, arr1[1]), `j` is 1**
