According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. Additionally, `arr1[0]` must remain at least 2 to allow the loop to continue.

No other states need to be adjusted as `temp`, `maxval`, and `i` do not affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` at least 2, `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or 0, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 2**
