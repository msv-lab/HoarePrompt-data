Given the initial state, we know that `arr1[0]` determines the value of `temp`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` will be the maximum value from the list `arr1` in the range from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. If `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, `temp` will remain 0. 

Since the code snippet `arr.append(temp)` appends the value of `temp` to `arr`, we need to consider the value of `temp` based on the conditions described.

1. If `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` will be assigned the maximum value found in `arr1[1:arr1[0]]`.
2. If `arr1[0] <= 1`, `temp` will be 0.

After executing `arr.append(temp)`, the `arr` list will contain the value of `temp`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the value of `temp` and the resulting `arr` state.

Output State: **`arr` contains `temp` where `temp` is the maximum of `arr1[1:arr1[0]]` if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0. `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list.**
