The code appends the value of `arr1[0]` to `arr2`. The initial state indicates that `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, and `arr` contains `temp` as a new element, but those variables are not affected by this operation.

The output state will reflect that `arr2` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `arr1[0]`. The state of `temp` and `arr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `arr` contains `temp` as a new element, and `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` as a new element.**
