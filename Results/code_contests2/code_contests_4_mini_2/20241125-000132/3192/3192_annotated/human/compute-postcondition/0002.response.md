The variable `maxval` is assigned the value of 0. The previous values of the affected variables are that `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and `arr` is an empty list. The assignment does not affect the values of `n` or `arr`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0**
