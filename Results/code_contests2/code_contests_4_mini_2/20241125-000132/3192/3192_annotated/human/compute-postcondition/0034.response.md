The variable `temp` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state of `temp` is the maximum value of `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0]-1`, but that is now reset to `0`. The other variables, including `arr1`, `maxval`, and `i`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `arr1` is a list of integers from input, `arr1[0]` is at least 2; `temp` is 0; `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`; `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i`.
