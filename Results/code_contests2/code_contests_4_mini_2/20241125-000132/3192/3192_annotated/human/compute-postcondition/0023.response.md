According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (since `arr1[0]` is specified to be greater than 1). 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the state of `j` needs to be adjusted to reflect this increment. The values of `arr`, `n`, `maxval`, `arr2`, `arr1`, and `temp` do not need to change, as they are not affected by the iteration of the loop.

State: **`arr` contains `temp`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers from user input with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, and `j` is 2**
