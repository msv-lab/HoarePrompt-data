According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, and `j` must be incremented to 2.

State: **`temp` is at least 2, `arr` includes the value of `temp`, `arr2` includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is k + 2, `n` is greater than k + 2, `arr1` is a list of integers including at least the value 2, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2**
