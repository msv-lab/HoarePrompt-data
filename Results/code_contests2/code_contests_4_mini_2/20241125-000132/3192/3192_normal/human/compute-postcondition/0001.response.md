The variable `arr` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, as the code only modifies `arr`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list**
