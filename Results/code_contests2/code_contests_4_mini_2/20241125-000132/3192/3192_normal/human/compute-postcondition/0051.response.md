According to the code, the loop can continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged. 

Thus, the adjusted states should reflect that `i` is now 1 while maintaining the other state variables.

State: **`arr` contains the maximum values of each input set excluding the first element of `arr1`, `arr2` contains the sizes of each input set, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `ans` is updated, and `i` is 1**
