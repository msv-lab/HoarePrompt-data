The code appends the value of `temp` to the list `arr`. The value of `temp` depends on the condition regarding `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0] > 1`, then `temp` is the maximum value among the elements from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`. If `arr1[0] <= 1`, then `temp` remains 0. Since the actual value of `temp` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output state reflects the condition on `temp` and the action of appending it to `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` now includes the value of `temp`, which is either the maximum of arr1[1] to arr1[arr1[0]-1] if arr1[0] > 1, or 0 if arr1[0] <= 1.**
