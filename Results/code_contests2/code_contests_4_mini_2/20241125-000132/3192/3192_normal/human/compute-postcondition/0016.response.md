The code appends the value of `arr1[0]` to the list `arr2`. The initial state indicates that `arr` includes the value of `temp`, which is determined based on the contents of `arr1`. Since `arr2` is being modified by appending a new value, the state of `arr2` is affected. The other variables remain unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`arr` now includes the value of `temp`, which is either the maximum of arr1[1] to arr1[arr1[0]-1] if arr1[0] > 1, or 0 if arr1[0] <= 1; `arr2` now includes an additional value of `arr1[0]**
