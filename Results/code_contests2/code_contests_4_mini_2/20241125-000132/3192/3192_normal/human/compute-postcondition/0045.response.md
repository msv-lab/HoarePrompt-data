The variable `maxval` is updated with the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. The variable `i` is `k + 2`, and `n` is greater than `k + 2`, which implies that `arr[i]` is a valid index and is within the bounds of the list `arr`. Since `arr1` includes either 2 or 0, `arr[i]` will also reflect that condition. The value of `maxval` will be updated if `arr[i]` is greater than the current value of `maxval`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `arr` includes the value of `temp`; `arr2` includes the previous values plus `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is updated based on the comparison with `arr[i]`; `i` is `k + 2`; `n` is greater than `k + 2`; `arr1` includes at least the value of either 2 or 0.

Output State: **`arr` includes the value of `temp`; `arr2` includes the previous values plus `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is updated based on the comparison with `arr[i]`; `i` is `k + 2`; `n` is greater than `k + 2`; `arr1` includes at least the value of either 2 or 0.**
