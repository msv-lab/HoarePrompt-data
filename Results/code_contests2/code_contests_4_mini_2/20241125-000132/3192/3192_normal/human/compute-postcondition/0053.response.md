According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and it must still be less than `n`. 

Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer and could be as low as 1, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 to allow for another iteration. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be 2 for the next iteration.
- `n` should be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`arr` contains the maximum values of each input set excluding the first element of `arr1`, `arr2` contains the sizes of each input set, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated, and `i` is 2**
