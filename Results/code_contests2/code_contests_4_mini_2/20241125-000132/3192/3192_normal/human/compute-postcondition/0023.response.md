According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2, and `arr1[0]` must be at least 3 to ensure that there is still room for additional iterations.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `j` should be updated to 2.
- `arr1[0]` should be greater than 2.

State: **`arr` includes the value of `temp`, `arr2` includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, `temp` is greater than 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `j` is 2**
