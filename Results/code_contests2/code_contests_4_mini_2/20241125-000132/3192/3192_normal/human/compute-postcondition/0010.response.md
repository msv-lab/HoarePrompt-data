The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` initially is `arr1[1]`, and `j` is 2, which means `arr1[j]` is `arr1[2]`. The condition states that `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element greater than 1, thus `arr1[2]` is also an integer greater than 1. 

The output state will reflect the updated value of `temp`, which will be either its previous value or the value of `arr1[2]`, depending on which is greater. However, since `arr1[1]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `temp`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element greater than 1; `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `arr1[2]`, depending on which is greater; `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element greater than 1; `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `arr1[2]`, depending on which is greater; `j` is 2.**
