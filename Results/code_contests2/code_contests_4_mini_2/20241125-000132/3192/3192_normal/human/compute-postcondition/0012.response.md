The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The specific value of `arr1[j]` depends on the contents of the list `arr1`. Since `j` is 3, `arr1[j]` refers to the fourth element of `arr1`. The current value of `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `arr1[2]`, depending on which is greater. The outcome of this operation will be that `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `arr1[3]`.

Given the initial conditions, the output state does not change the values of other variables, only updating `temp`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element greater than 1; `temp` is either the maximum of its current value and `arr1[3]`; `j` is 3; `arr1[0]` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element greater than 1; `temp` is either the maximum of its current value and `arr1[3]`; `j` is 3; `arr1[0]` is greater than 2.**
