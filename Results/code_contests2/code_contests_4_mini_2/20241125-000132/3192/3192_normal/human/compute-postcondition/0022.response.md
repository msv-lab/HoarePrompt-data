The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[j]`. Given that `temp` is initially 0 and `arr1[j]` is an integer from the list `arr1`, the value of `temp` will be updated to the value of `arr1[j]` since it is greater than 0. The previous values of the affected variables are `temp` (which is 0) and `arr1[j]` (which is greater than 1, as per the initial state). Thus, `temp` will take the value of `arr1[j]`.

Output State: **`arr` includes the value of `temp`, `arr2` includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, `temp` is greater than 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
