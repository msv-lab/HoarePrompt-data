Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from input, which represents the number of sets of integers. For each set, it reads a list of integers, extracts the maximum value (excluding the first integer), and stores the maximum values and sizes of each set. Then, it computes a total `ans`, which is the sum of the products of the differences between the overall maximum value and each set's maximum value multiplied by the size of each set. Finally, it prints the computed total `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters directly and assumes valid input is provided. If `n` is 0 or negative, it does not execute the loops and prints 0. **
