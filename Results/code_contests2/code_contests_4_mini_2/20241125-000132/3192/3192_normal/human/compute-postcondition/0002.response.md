The variable `maxval` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any other variables, including `n` and `arr`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0**
