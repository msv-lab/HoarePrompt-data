According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3. Since `n` is greater than 1, it allows for `i` to be 3. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 3.

State: **`arr` contains the maximum values of each input set excluding the first element of `arr1`, `arr2` contains the sizes of each input set, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to include `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, `i` is 3**
