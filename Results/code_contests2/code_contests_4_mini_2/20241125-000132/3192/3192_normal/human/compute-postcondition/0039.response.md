According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `arr1[0]`. To execute one more time, `j` must be less than `arr1[0]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2 (so that `j` can take the value of 2 again) and `j` should be updated to 3.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr1` includes at least the value 3. 

State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`, `arr` includes the value of `temp`, `arr2` includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is k + 2, `n` is greater than k + 2, `arr1` is a list of integers including at least the value 3, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3**
