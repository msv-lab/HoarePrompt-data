The variable `temp` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, `i`, `n`, and `arr1` remain unchanged, as only `temp` is modified. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new assignment for `temp`.

Output State: **`arr` includes the value of `temp`, `arr2` includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, and `temp` is 0**
