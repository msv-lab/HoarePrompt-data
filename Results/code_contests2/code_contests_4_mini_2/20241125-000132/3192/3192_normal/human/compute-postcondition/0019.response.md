The code `arr1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into separate values, converts each value to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr1`. 

Since the initial state mentions that `arr` includes the value of `temp`, `arr2` includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated based on the previous values, `i` is set to `k + 1`, and `n` is greater than `k + 1`, the execution of the input will affect `arr1`, but the other variables remain unchanged.

The output state will reflect that `arr1` is now a list of integers based on the input provided, while other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`arr` includes the value of `temp`, `arr2` includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1, `arr1` is a list of integers from input**.
