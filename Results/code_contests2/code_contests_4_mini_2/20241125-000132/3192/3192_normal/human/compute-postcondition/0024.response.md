The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[j]`. Given that `temp` is greater than 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, we can infer that `arr1[j]` is an integer (though its value is not explicitly stated, it is assumed to be less than or equal to `arr1[0]` since `j` is 2).

The output state will reflect the updated value of `temp`, which becomes the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. The other variables remain unaffected in this operation.

Output State: **`arr` includes the value of `temp`, `arr2` includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, `temp` is updated to be max(temp, arr1[j]), `temp` is greater than 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `j` is 2**
