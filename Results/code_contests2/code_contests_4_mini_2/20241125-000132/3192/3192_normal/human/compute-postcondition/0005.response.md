The code assigns the value of `arr1` to be a list of integers obtained from the input. The variable `arr` remains an empty list, `maxval` remains 0, `arr2` remains an empty list, and `i` remains 0. The state of `arr1` will depend on the input provided, which can be any list of integers. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers from input.**
