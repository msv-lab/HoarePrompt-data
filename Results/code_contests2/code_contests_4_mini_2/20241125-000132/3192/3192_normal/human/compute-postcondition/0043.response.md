Output State: **`arr` includes the value of `temp`, which is either the maximum of `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` if `arr1[0] > 1` or 0 if `arr1[0] <= 1`; `arr2` includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is updated accordingly if `arr1[0] > 1` but remains unchanged if `arr1[0] <= 1`; `i` is `k + 2`; `n` is greater than `k + 2`; `arr1` is a list of integers including at least the value of either 2 or 0.**
