The value of `arr2` will be updated by appending `arr1[0]` to it. Since `arr1` includes an additional value, `arr1[0]` will be added to `arr2`. Other variables remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` includes the value of `temp`, `arr2` now includes the previous values plus `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated accordingly if `arr1[0] > 1` but remains unchanged if `arr1[0] <= 1`, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is greater than `k + 2`, and `arr1` is a list of integers including at least the value of either 2 or 0.
