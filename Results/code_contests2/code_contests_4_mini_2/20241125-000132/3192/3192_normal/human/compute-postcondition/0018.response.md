According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the limit `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at a value that is not specified, but we know that for the loop to run again, `i` must be less than `n`.

To determine what needs to be adjusted, we can consider that `i` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, if `i` was at a value such that it was less than `n` at the end of the last iteration, we can express it in the state.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, it follows that we need to ensure that it is updated for the next iteration. If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it must now be `k + 1`, and we must also ensure that `n` is greater than `k + 1` to allow the loop to run again.

Thus, we will express the state as:

State: **`arr` includes the value of `temp`, `arr2` includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1**
