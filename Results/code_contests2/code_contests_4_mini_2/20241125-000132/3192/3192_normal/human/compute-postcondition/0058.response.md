The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It operates based on the constraints that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. Each company has a positive integer `m_i` representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 200,000, followed by `m_i` positive integers representing the salaries of these employees, each salary being a positive integer not exceeding 10^9. The total number of employees across all companies does not exceed 200,000.

The function processes this data and returns a result based on the salaries provided for the employees across the companies.

Functionality: **The function processes data regarding a number of companies and their employees' salaries, returning a result based on the input salaries without accepting parameters directly.**
