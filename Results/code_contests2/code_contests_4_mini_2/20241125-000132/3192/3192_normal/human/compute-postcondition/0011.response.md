According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the condition defined by `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. Since `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element greater than 1, we can infer that `arr1[0]` is at least 2. However, to allow for another iteration, it needs to be greater than 2.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.
- `j` should be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element greater than 1; `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `arr1[2]`, depending on which is greater; `j` is 3; `arr1[0]` is greater than 2**
