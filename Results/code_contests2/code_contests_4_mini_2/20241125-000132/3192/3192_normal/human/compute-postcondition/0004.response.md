According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, which is guaranteed since `n` is a positive integer. The variable `i` will start at 0 and will increment with each iteration of the loop until it reaches `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be `n - 1`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute:
- `n` is already a positive integer.
- The initial value of `i` must be set to 0.

There are no other variables in the loop that affect its execution. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
