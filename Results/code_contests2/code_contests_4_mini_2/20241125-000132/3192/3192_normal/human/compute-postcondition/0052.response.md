The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the product of the difference `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. The variable `i` is currently 1, so we will use the values of `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval` at index `i` (which is 1) to perform the calculation.

Assuming:
- `arr[i]` is the value at index 1 of `arr`
- `arr2[i]` is the value at index 1 of `arr2`
- `maxval` is a known maximum value found in `arr`

The output state after executing the code will reflect the updated value of `ans`. Since `ans` is updated but not specified in the initial state, we can only describe how it changes.

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values of each input set excluding the first element of `arr1`, `arr2` contains the sizes of each input set, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `ans` is updated, and `i` is 1; `ans` is increased by `(maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]`.**
