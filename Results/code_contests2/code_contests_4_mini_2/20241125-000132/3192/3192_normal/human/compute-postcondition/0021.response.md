According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to (but does not include) `arr1[0]`. Given that `temp` is 0, it does not influence the execution directly, but it may be relevant for the state after the loop. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need:
1. `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1.
2. The loop variable `j` should start from 1.

Since `i` is `k + 1` and `n` is greater than `k + 1`, this indicates that `k` must be less than `n - 1`, but it does not directly affect the `j` variable within the loop.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the necessary conditions are:
- `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, which allows the range of `j` to have valid values.
- `j` is initialized to 1 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`arr` includes the value of `temp`, `arr2` includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, `temp` is 0, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
