The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[j]`. Given that `temp` is greater than 1 and `arr1[j]` is the element at index 3 of the list `arr1`, we can conclude that both `temp` and `arr1[j]` will influence the new value of `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `temp` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`arr` includes the value of `temp`, `arr2` includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, `temp` is updated to be max(temp, arr1[3]), `temp` is greater than 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, `j` is 3**
