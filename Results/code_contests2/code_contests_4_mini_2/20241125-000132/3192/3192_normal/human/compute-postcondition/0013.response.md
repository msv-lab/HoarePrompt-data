According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop starts at `j = 1` and continues as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 2. This indicates that `arr1[0]` must be at least 4 for the loop to run again. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to increment to 4. Therefore, `arr1[0]` must be adjusted to be at least 4. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element greater than 1; `temp` is either the maximum of its current value and `arr1[3]`; `j` is 4; `arr1[0]` is greater than 3.**
