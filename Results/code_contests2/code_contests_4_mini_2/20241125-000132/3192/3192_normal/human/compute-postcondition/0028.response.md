Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `arr` includes the value of `temp`, `arr2` includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1, `arr1` is a list of integers from input. If `arr1[0]` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute, and `temp` remains 0.**
