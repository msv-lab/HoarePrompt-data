According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`, which is `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ arr1[0] ≤ 200,000`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `arr1[0]` and since `j` is currently 1, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `arr1[0]` to be at least 2, and `j` at the start of the next iteration should be 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element greater than 1; `temp` is `arr1[1]`; `j` is 2**
