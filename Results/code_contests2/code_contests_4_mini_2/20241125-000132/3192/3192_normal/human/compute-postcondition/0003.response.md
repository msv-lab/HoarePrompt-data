The code initializes `arr2` as an empty list. The initial values of `n`, `arr`, and `maxval` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list**
