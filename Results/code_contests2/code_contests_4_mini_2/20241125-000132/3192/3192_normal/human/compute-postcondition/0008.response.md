The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and `arr1[j]`. The variable `j` is 1, so `arr1[j]` refers to the second element of the list `arr1`. Since `arr1` has at least one element greater than 1, `arr1[j]` will be greater than 0. Therefore, `temp` will be assigned the value of `arr1[j]`, which is some positive integer greater than 1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element greater than 1; `temp` is `arr1[1]`; `j` is 1**
