The code assigns `maxval` the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. The previous values of `arr` and `maxval` will determine the new value of `maxval`. Since `arr` includes the value of `temp`, which is either the maximum of a certain range or 0, and `arr2` includes an additional value from `arr1`, we cannot specify the exact values without knowing `i` or the specific content of `arr`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `maxval` based on the comparison.

Output State: **`arr` now includes the value of `temp`; `arr2` now includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`.**
