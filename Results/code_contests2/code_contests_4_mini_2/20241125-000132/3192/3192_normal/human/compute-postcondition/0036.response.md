The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and the value at `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1 and `arr1` is a list of integers that includes at least the value 2, `arr1[1]` is at least 2. Therefore, `temp` will be updated to at least 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`temp` is at least 2, `arr` includes the value of `temp`, `arr2` includes an additional value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is k + 2, `n` is greater than k + 2, `arr1` is a list of integers including at least the value 2, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1**
