Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values of each input set excluding the first element of `arr1`, `arr2` contains the sizes of each input set (values of `arr1[0]`), `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `arr` and `arr2` remain empty, while `maxval` remains 0.**
