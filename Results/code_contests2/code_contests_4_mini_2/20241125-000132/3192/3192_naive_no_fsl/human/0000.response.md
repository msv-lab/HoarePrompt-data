Correctness: **False**

Upon analyzing the provided program, it appears to have an issue with how it calculates the maximum salary for each company. Specifically, the loop that determines the maximum salary incorrectly iterates from `1` to `arr1[0]`, which leads to not including the last salary in the list. The loop should iterate from `1` to `arr1[0] + 1` instead, or simply use `max(arr1[1:])` to ensure that all salaries are considered.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2 4 3
2 2 1
3 1 1 1
```

According to the problem, the maximum salaries for the companies should be:

- Company 1: max(4, 3) = 4
- Company 2: max(2, 1) = 2
- Company 3: max(1, 1, 1) = 1

However, due to the incorrect iteration in the program, it will miscalculate the maximum salary for Company 1 and Company 2, leading to an incorrect total increase computation.

This means the program does not adhere to the problem description in all potential cases, hence it is not correct.
