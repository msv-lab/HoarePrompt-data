The function continuously accepts triplets of integers `n`, `m`, and `s` where `n` must be between 1 and 7, `m` must be between 1 and 2000, and `s` must be between 1 and 3000. The input process continues until all three values are zero. For each valid triplet, the function calculates and prints a specific value derived from a dynamic programming table based on the inputs. The function does not handle cases where `n`, `m`, or `s` are out of the specified range within the loop, nor does it verify the validity of the input beyond the termination condition.
