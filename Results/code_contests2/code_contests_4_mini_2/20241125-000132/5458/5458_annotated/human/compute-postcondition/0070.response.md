The code snippet updates the value of `dp` based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Given that `j` (which is 2) is less than or equal to `k` (which is 3), there are no changes to the state, and the control moves to the next iteration without executing any updates. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 2 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and there are no updates made to the state.**
