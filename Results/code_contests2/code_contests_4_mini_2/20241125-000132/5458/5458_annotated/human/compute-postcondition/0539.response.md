According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and its relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which must be less than `n ** 2` for the loop to continue.

To determine the necessary adjustments:
- We need to ensure that `i` is updated to its next value, which will be `i + 1` for the next iteration.
- `n` remains within its bounds, but we must also ensure that `i + 1` is still less than `n ** 2` for the loop to execute again.

Since `i` is less than `n ** 2`, we need to adjust it to `i + 1`. 

State: **`i` is less than `n ** 2`** (no specific value provided), `n` remains unchanged**.
