The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value `1`. 

Here, `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to `1`. Therefore, we are accessing `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. 

Next, `j` is `1`, so `j + 1` is `2`, and `k` is `2`. 

Thus, `dp[1][2][2]` will be set to `1`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and the values in the `dp` list, except for `dp[1][2][2]`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp[1][2][2]` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2**
