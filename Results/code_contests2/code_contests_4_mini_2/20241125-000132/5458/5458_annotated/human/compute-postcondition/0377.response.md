Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1; otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][3][1]` remains unchanged, and if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][1]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` ensuring that the index accesses are valid. No changes are made to the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` throughout the execution.***
