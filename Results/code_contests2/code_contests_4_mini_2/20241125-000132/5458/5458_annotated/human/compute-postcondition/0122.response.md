Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not update the `dp` array and proceeds without any changes to the `dp` values.***
