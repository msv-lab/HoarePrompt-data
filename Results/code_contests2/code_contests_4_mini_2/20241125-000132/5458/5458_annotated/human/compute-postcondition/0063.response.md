Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 2 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][3][2]` is set to the value of `dp[1][2][2]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is updated based on the value of `dp[0][2][0]` (where `k - j` is valid) modulo `mod`. In all cases, the state of `dp` reflects these updates according to the conditions.***
