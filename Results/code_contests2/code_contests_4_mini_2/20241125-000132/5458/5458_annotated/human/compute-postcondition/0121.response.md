The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][j + 1][k] = dp[0][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][j + 1][k] = dp[0][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
