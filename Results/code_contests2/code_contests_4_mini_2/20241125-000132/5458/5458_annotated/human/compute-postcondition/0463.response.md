Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the variables and the loop proceeds without executing this block.***
