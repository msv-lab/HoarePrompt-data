Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` has been modified at position `[1][j + 1][1]` if `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), while `i` remains 0 and `j` is at least equal to `k`. If `j < k`, no changes are made to `dp`.***
