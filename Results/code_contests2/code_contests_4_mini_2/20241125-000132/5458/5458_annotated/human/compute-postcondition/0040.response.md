Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` varies from 1 to `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute `s` times. Within the loop, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged for that iteration. If `i` is greater than 0, the values of `dp` will be updated based on the specified conditions involving `j` and `k`. If `s` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged.**
