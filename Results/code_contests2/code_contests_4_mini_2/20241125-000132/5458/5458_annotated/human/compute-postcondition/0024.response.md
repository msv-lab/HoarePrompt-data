The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional array `dp`, where the indices are calculated from the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1
- `k` is 2

Calculating the indices:
- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1` (the result of the bitwise AND operation).
- `j + 1` evaluates to `2`.

So, the left-hand side of the assignment becomes `dp[1][2][2]`, and we need to assign it the value from the right-hand side, which is `dp[1][1][2]`.

The output state reflects that the value at `dp[1][2][2]` is set based on the value from `dp[1][1][2]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and other variables remain unchanged as this operation does not modify them directly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][2]`.**
