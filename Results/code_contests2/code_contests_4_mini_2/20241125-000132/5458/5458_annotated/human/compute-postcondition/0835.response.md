The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 and less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than 1; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]**
