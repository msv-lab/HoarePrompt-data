Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `i` is `n` (where `n` is not equal to 0), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the states of the variables, and the program execution proceeds beyond the if statement.***
