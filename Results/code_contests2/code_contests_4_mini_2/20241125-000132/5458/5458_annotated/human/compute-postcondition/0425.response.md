The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the loop in which it is executed to skip the remaining code for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since no specific loop context is provided, we only note that the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 2 and 3000, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
