The code snippet executes a `continue` statement, which causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged in this context, so no variables are affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variable states and indicates that we continue with the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 2 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `dp[1][3][3]` is updated to `dp[1][2][3]`, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**
