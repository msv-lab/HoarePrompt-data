Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is equal to 3, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without changing the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no operations are performed and the program flow will proceed to the next statement outside the if condition.***
