Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is between 2 and `s + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
