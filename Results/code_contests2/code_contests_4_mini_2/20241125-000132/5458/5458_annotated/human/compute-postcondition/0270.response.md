Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][s - j]`, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the process continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no update to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, and the program continues without executing the assignment.***
