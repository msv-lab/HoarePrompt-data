Output State: **If `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute up to `s` times, with `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[0][j][k - j]`. If `s` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute, and all variables remain unchanged, with `k` not being assigned any value. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j` remain as defined in the initial state.**
