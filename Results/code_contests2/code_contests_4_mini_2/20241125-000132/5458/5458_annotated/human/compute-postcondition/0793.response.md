According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop runs for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. Given that `s` is already between 1 and 3000, this condition is satisfied. 

At the start of the loop, `k` will take the value of 1 in the first iteration. The other variables `i`, `j`, `m`, and `n` do not affect the execution of the loop, but they are provided in the state. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the relevant states are:
- `s` is between 1 and 3000 (ensuring the loop can run),
- `k` is initialized to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m + 1, k is 1**
