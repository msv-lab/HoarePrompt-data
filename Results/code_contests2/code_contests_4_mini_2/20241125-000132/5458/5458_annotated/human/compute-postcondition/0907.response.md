Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is 7, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp` or the iteration process.***
