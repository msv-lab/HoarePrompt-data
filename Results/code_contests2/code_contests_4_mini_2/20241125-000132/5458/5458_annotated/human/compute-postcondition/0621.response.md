Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m`, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
