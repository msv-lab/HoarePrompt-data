The code assigns the value `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are previously defined: `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `(0 + 1) & 1`, which results in `1`. Therefore, the index for the first dimension of `dp` becomes `1`. 

Since `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is `1`, the values of `j + 1` becomes `m + 2`. The state of `n` and `m` remains unchanged, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. 

Thus, the output state, reflecting the unchanged and affected variables, is:
Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is set to 1.**
