Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `k` is less than `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. There is no change to the state of `dp` if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
