According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is between 1 and 3000. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, thus `k` should be 3. The condition for the loop to continue is satisfied if `s` is at least 3.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `k` is 3.
- `s` remains within the range of 1 to 3000 (no specific change is needed as long as it is greater than or equal to 3).

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 3 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**
