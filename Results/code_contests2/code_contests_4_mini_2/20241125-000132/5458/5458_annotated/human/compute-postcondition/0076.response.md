According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1 since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `s + 1`. The current state indicates that `n`, `s`, and `i` are unchanged, while `m` is increased by at least 1 and `j` is set to `m + 1`. 

To ensure the loop will execute, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 1. Additionally, `k` will start at 1 on the first iteration. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the conditions must be such that `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is initialized at 1.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1**
