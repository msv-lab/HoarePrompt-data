Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` remains unchanged and is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[1][j][k]`. There is no change if `j` is less than or equal to `k`.***
