The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, the values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the addition of the information that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
