Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains unchanged and is equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), then `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
