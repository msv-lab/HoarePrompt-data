According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop is set to iterate from `k = 1` to `k = s + 1`, meaning it will execute if `s` is at least 1. The initial state indicates that `s` is at least 1, which satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, the value of `k` will be 1, as it begins iterating from 1. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` affect the loop indirectly but do not need adjustment for the loop to execute since `k` will start at 1 and iterate until it reaches `s + 1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `s` must be at least 1 (which it is),
- `k` will be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

No changes are needed for `i`, `j`, or `k`, as `k` will be set to 1 automatically at the start. Therefore, the state can be expressed as follows:

State: **`i` is 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1**
