Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m + 1` and is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0; if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to match `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues.***
