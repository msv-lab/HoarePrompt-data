The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 if `i` equals 0, or equal to `m + 1` and greater than 1 if `i` is greater than 0, `k` is `s + 1`, and the statement `continue` is executed, skipping the current iteration.
