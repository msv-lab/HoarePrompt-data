Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. In the else block, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged; otherwise, `dp[1][2][2]` is updated based on the values from previous states, specifically by taking a modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, maintaining all variable conditions throughout.***
