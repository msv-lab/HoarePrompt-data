Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated such that if `j` is greater than `k` (which is 3), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the current iteration is completed. Additionally, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, ensuring that all indices involved remain valid for the updates performed.***
