Postcondition: ***`dp` remains unchanged. If `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than `k` (which is 1), the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute the condition but continues with the next iteration without modifying `dp`.***
