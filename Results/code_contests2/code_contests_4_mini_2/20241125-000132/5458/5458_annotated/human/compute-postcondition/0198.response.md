The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables in the program. It simply skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
