According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1, as the range for `j` is from 1 to `m + 1`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is `n`, these states do not affect the execution of the loop directly. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `m` is greater than or equal to 1. At the beginning of the loop, `j` should start at 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `j` is 1**
