Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value `1`. If `j` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to `dp`.***
