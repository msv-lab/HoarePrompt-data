Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, otherwise `dp` values remain unchanged.**
