The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned based on the input provided by `raw_input()`, which will accept three integers. The initial state specifies that `N`, `M`, and `S` can take values within certain ranges. The `map(int, raw_input().split())` function will read the input and convert it to integers, assigning them to `n`, `m`, and `s`.

Since the initial values of `N`, `M`, and `S` are not explicitly given in the execution context, we cannot determine their specific values after the input operation without knowing what the user inputs. Therefore, we can only infer that `n`, `m`, and `s` are now integers within the specified ranges.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7 (inclusive), `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000 (inclusive)**
