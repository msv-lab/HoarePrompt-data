Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is equal to 2, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. There is no change to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`.***
