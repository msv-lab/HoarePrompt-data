Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, and `s` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then the dp array remains unchanged at that index. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures that all potential updates to the dp array are captured based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
