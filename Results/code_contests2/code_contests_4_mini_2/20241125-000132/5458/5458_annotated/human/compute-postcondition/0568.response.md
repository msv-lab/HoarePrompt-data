Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, this condition does not affect the state of the program, and the variables retain their initial values. The loop will continue based on the outer structure of the program.***
