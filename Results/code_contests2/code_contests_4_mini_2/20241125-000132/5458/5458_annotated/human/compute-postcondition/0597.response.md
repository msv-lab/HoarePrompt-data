According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 3. Additionally, `s` must be at least 3 to ensure that the loop can continue executing.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `k` is now 3, and `s` should be stated as being greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3**
