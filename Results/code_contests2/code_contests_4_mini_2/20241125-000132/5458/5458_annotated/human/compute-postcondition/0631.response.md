According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate for `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `s` is at least 1 and `k` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted to 3. Additionally, since the loop runs while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are that `s` must be at least 3 and `k` must be 3.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `m`, and `k` is 3**
