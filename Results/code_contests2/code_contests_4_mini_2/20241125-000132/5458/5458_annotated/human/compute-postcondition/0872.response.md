The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop, moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variable values.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is 7, `i` is 48, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][1]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
