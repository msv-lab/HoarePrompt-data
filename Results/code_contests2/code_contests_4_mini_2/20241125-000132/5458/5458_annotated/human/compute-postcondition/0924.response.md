The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `s`, `m`, `n`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop without altering any variable's value.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is 7, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
