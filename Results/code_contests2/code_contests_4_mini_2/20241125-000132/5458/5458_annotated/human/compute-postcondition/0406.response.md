The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modifies the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The left-hand side of the assignment takes the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which involves computing `i + 1 & 1`. Since `i` is not equal to 0, `i + 1` can be either 1 or 2. 

- If `i` is odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7), then `i + 1` will be even (2, 4, 6, 8), and `i + 1 & 1` will yield 0.
- If `i` is even (e.g., 2, 4, 6), then `i + 1` will be odd (3, 5, 7), and `i + 1 & 1` will yield 1.

Thus, `i + 1 & 1` will alternate between 0 and 1 depending on whether `i` is even or odd.

The value for `j + 1` will be between 2 and 2001 (since `j` is greater than `k`, which is 1). 

The right-hand side `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` remains unchanged, meaning we are simply copying the value from one index in the `dp` list to another.

Since the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, we express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` is unchanged, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
