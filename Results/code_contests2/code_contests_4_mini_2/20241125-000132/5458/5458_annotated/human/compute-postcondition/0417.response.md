Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 2 and 3000, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged except for the specific conditions detailed in the precondition.***
