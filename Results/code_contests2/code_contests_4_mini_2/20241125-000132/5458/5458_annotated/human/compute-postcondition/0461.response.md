The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multidimensional array `dp`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are being used as indices, but their values are not specified in the initial state. The variable `k` is equal to 3, which is given. 

The operation itself does not alter the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, or `k`, but it does imply that the assignment is made within the `dp` array based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. However, since we don't know the specific values of `i` and `j`, we cannot determine specific values for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` or `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Thus, the output state must reflect that the operation was attempted without changing any defined variables, and we still lack specific values for `i` and `j`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7; `m` is between 1 and 2000; `s` is between 1 and 3000; `k` is 3; and the operation dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] is performed without changing the variable states.**
