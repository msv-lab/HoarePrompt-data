The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `i` is less than `n`, so `i + 1 & 1` will produce either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. The values of `j` and `k` are not affected by this operation, as the code only modifies `dp` at the specified indices. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the assignment operation.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
