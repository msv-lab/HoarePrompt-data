The code assigns the value `1` to the element at the position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Here, `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`, and `k` is `1`. 

Calculating the indices:
- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- `j + 1` evaluates to `3`.
- `k` is `1`.

Thus, the assignment is made to `dp[1][3][1]`.

The initial state variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`) are not affected except for the specific element in the `dp` list.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is modified at `dp[1][3][1]` which is now `1`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is modified at `dp[1][3][1]` which is now `1`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
