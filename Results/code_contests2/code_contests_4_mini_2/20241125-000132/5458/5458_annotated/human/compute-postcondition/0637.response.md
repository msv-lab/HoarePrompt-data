The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variable `j` is equal to `m`, which is at least 1, and `k` is 3. Since `j` is equal to `m`, the updated `j + 1` will be at least 2. 

The output state remains unchanged for `s`, `i`, `m`, and `k`, and only the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulus operation with `mod` applied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 3, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
