Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
