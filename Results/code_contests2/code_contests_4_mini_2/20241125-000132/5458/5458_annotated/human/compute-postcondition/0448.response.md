Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then the `dp` list remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` when `j` is greater than `k`; otherwise, it is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The operations ensure that values in `dp` are appropriately computed based on the relationships among `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
