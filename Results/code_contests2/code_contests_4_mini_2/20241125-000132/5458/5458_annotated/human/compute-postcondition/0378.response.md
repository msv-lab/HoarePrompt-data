According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop iterates with `k` starting from 1 and going up to `s` (which is between 1 and 3000). At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be updated to 2. The condition for `k` to be less than or equal to `s` will still hold true because `s` is at least 1 and can be as high as 3000.

No other states need to be adjusted as `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2**
