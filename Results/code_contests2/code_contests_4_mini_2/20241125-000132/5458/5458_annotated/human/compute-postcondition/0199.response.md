Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated such that if `j` (equal to `m`) is greater than `k` (which is 2), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp` in this iteration. The variable `s` remains greater than or equal to 2 throughout the process.***
