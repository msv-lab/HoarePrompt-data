The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The operation `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either `0` or `1` depending on the value of `i`. Since `i` is `0`, `i + 1 & 1` results in `1`. 

Thus, the assignment can be simplified to:
```
dp[1][j + 1][k] = dp[1][j][k]
```

The output state indicates that `j` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value stored in `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be equal to the value stored in `dp[1][j][k]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[1][j][k]`**
