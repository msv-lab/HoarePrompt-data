Given the initial state where `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2, we analyze the provided code snippet.

Since `j` (which is 2) is not greater than `k` (which is also 2), the condition for executing the assignment does not hold true. As a result, the program does not execute any statement and proceeds without modifications to the data.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state. 

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2; no modifications made.**
