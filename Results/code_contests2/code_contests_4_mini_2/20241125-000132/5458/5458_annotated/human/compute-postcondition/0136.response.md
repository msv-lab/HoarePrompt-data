The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` affects the state of the program. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` calculates the value for the first index of the array `dp`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `i + 1` equals 1. The bitwise AND operation with 1 (`1 & 1`) results in 1. Therefore, the first index becomes 1.

2. The second index is calculated as `j + 1`. Since `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `j + 1` is at least 2.

3. The third index is simply `k`, which is 3.

4. The assignment `dp[1][j + 1][3] = 1` sets the value at this specific location in the `dp` array to 1. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged in value.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables and the modification made to the `dp` array.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1**.
