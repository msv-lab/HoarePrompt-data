According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and `m` is at least 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3 (since `m` is at least 3). No other states need to be modified because `n` (between 2 and 7), `s` (between 1 and 3000), and `k` (which could be any value from 1 to `s`) do not directly influence the loop's continuation for `j`.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is at least 3, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 3**
