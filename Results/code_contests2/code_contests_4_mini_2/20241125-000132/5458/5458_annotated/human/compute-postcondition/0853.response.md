The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged with respect to the variable values.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 and less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 3, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
