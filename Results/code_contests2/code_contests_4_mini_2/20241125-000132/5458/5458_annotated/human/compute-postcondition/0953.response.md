Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated such that if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` remains unchanged; otherwise, it is updated based on earlier values with the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][2 - j] % mod`. Additionally, `m` is incremented by 1, and the conditions ensure that `s` is greater than or equal to 1. This captures all cases, including scenarios where `j` is less than, equal to, or greater than `k`, and reflects how `dp` is manipulated under these circumstances.***
