According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1 because the range in `xrange(1, s + 1)` starts from 1 and goes up to `s`. Additionally, since `k` will start at 1, there is no need to adjust `k` as it will take its first value during the loop execution. 

Given the initial state, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 1, the key adjustment needed is to ensure that `s` is at least 1. 

State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
