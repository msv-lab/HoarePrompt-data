Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.***
