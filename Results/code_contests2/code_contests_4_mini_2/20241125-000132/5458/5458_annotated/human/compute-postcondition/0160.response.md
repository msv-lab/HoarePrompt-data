According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `s` (where `s` remains at least 1) and `k` starts from 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to take on the next integer value, which would be 2, provided that `s` is at least 2.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is currently 1, and since `s` remains at least 1, it can be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, `k` must be adjusted to 2 and to ensure that the loop can execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`dp` remains unchanged, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2**
