The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop without executing any further statements in the current iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
