Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
