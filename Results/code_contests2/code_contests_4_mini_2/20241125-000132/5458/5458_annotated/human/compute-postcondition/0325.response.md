The line of code `n, m, s = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input as a string, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `s`. Since `n` is between 1 and 7 (inclusive), `m` is between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), and `s` is between 1 and 3000 (inclusive), the values of these variables will be updated based on user input. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are not specified, but they will be replaced by the new input values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 7 (inclusive), `m` is an input integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), `s` is an input integer between 1 and 3000 (inclusive)**
