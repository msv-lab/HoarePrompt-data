The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, while `s` remains greater than or equal to 2, so the states of other variables are not directly affected. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` and `s` remains greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` and `s` remains greater than or equal to 2**
