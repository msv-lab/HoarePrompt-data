According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, meaning that `k` must be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4, and it must still be less than or equal to `s`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `k` must be updated to 4.
- We do not need to change `i`, `m`, `j`, or `s`, since they are not directly affected by the loop iteration itself.

State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is 4**
