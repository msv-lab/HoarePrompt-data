Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list of zeros, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains 0 as it is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration without any modification to `j`, `k`, or `i`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no change to `dp`, and the program would continue with its previous state.***
