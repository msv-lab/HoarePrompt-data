Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute the if block.***
