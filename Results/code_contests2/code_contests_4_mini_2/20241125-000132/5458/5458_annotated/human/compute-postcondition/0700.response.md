Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value `1`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
