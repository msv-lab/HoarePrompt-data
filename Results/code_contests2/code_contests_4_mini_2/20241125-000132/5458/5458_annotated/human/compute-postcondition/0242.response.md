Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, indicating that the condition is satisfied and the corresponding entry in the dp array is updated. If `j` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to `dp`, and it retains its previous state.***
