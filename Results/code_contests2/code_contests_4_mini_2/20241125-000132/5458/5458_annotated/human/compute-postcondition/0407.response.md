The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables directly. It simply skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` is unchanged, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
