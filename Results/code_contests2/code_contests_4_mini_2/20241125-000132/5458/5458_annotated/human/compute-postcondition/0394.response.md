The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` indicates that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being updated by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is between 1 and 7,
- `m` is between 1 and 2000,
- `s` is greater than or equal to `s + 1` (which is a logical contradiction and suggests that `s` cannot hold a consistent value),
- The state and values of `dp` arrays are not provided.

The code updates the `dp` array but does not provide specific values or constraints regarding the values of `dp`. As such, we cannot definitively calculate a numeric output without knowing the state of the `dp` array prior to this operation.

However, we can summarize the impact of the operation as follows:

- The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, but we do not have specific values for `dp` or `mod` to provide a numerical output.

Thus, the output state is focused on the update action.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
