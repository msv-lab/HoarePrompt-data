The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it will skip the rest of the current iteration in the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged with respect to the variable values.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is at least 3, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
