Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is initialized to 1, `i` is 0, and `k` is equal to 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the if block, and the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.***
