Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is equal to or greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is at least 1 and less than 48, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][1]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is calculated as the sum of `dp[1][1][1]` and `dp[0][1][0]`, both taken modulo `mod`. In all cases, the variable states are maintained or updated according to the described conditions.***
