Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 2 and 3000, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged at the specified index. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All modifications depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, ensuring that the index updates are consistent with the input conditions.***
