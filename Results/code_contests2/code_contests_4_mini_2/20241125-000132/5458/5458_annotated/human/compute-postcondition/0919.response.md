Postcondition: ***Given that `s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is 7, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp`; if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and includes an additional value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, thus ensuring all cases of `j` relative to `k` are handled.***
