The `continue` statement does not change any variable values; it simply skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the states of all variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
