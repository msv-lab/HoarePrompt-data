The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceeds to the next iteration. However, since the values of the variables `s`, `j`, `k`, and `i` are unchanged, the output state reflects that the program continues to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
