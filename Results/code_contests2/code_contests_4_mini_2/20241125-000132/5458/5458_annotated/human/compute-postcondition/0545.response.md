Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. There is no change to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`.***
