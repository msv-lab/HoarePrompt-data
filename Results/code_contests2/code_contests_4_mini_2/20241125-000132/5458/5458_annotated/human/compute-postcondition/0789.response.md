Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, and `k` is equal to `k + 1` (where `k` was less than `s`). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and it is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Thus, the modifications to `dp` depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` as described.***
