According to the code, the `while 1` loop will always execute indefinitely since the condition is always true. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time as it will continue to do so regardless of the current values of `n`, `m`, and `s`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000**
