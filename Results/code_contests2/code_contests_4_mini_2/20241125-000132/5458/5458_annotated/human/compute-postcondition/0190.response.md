Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s`. If `j` is greater than 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the iteration continues to the next cycle. If `j` is not greater than 1, no changes to `dp` are made in this iteration.***
