The `continue` statement is executed, which means that the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the program moves to the next iteration without changing the values of `s`, `m`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the output state reflects that no variables have changed, but we note that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, `k` is less than `s`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
