The code snippet `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The states of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m + 1` and greater than 1, `k` is 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
