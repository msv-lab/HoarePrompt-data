The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned from the input received through `raw_input()` and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since the specific input values are not provided, we cannot determine their exact values but know they will be integers. The previous state indicates that `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, and `s` is between 1 and 3000, which will be overwritten.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 3000**
