The code modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The initial state indicates that `j` is `m + 1` and `k` is 1. Given that `j` is greater than `k` (since `j` is `m + 1` and `m` is at least 1), the condition is true, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated.

The affected variables are `dp` and they change as follows:
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Since the specific values of `dp` are not provided, we can only describe the changes in a general sense without concrete numerical values.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `j` is `m + 1` and `k` is 1.**
