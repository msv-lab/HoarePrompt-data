The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that we skip to the next iteration without any changes to the variable values.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `k`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
