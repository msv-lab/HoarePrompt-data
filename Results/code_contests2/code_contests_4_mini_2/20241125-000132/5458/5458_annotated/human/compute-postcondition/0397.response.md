Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list. If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, leaving `dp` unchanged. If `s` is at least 1, the loop executes `s` times, with `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. For each `k`, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`. After the loop executes, the values of `dp` will depend on the conditions evaluated for each iteration of `k`.**
