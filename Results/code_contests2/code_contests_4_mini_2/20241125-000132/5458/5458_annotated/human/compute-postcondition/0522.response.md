Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is at least 3, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the loop proceeds without any modifications to the state.***
