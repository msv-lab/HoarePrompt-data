Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated at index `[1][m + 1][1]` to 1 if `i` is 0 and `m` (which is equal to `j`) is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `m` is greater than 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][m][1]`. If `m` is less than or equal to 1 while `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][1]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][m][1]` and `dp[i & 1][m][0]`. In all cases, `m` is incremented by 1, `k` remains 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1.***
