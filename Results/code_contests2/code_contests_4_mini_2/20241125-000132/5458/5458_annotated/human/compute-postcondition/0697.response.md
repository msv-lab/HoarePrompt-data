Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is `m + 1` (and therefore greater than 1), `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues without changes.***
