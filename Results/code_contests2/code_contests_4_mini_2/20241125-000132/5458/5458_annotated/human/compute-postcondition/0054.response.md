Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, the function attempts to update `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]`, but this may lead to an out-of-bounds index error depending on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The function must ensure that all indices used in the `dp` array are within valid bounds to avoid runtime errors.***
