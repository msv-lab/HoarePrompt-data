Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][2]`. There is no change to the state of `dp` if `j` is not greater than `k`, and all other variables remain unchanged.***
