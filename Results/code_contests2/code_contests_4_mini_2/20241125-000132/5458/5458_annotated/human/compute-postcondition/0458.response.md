According to the code, the loop will execute while `k` is in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is between 2 and `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Given that `k` is currently between 2 and `s + 1`, this means that for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be adjusted to at least 3. 

Since `k` can take values up to `s + 1`, which means it can go up to `s + 1`, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k` is now 3 (the next value in the range). 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` should be adjusted to 3.

The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` do not require modification as their ranges still remain valid.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 3**
