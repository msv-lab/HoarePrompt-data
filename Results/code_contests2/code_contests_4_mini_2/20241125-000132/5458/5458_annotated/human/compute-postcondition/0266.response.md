The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is 0, `k` is `s + 1`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, we can evaluate the indices for the `dp` array. 

The value of `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`, and `j + 1` will be one more than the current value of `j`. The state of other variables such as `dp[i & 1][j][s - j]` is not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[1][j + 1][s + 1]` is now set to `1`.

Output State: **`dp[1][j + 1][s + 1]` is set to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, and `k` is equal to `s + 1**
