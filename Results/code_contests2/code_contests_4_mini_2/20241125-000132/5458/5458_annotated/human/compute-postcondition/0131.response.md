Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. There is no change to `dp` or other variables if `j` is less than or equal to `k`.***
