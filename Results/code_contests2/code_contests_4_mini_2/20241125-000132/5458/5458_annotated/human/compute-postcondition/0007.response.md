According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1, which is guaranteed by the given state since `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, and `j` will start from 1 based on the loop definition. Therefore, the initial state is sufficient for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
