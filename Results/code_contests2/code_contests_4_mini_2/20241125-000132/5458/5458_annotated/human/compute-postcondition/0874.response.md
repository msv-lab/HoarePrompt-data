The value of `j` is 1, and the value of `k` is also 1. Since `j` is not greater than `k`, the condition for modifying `dp` is not satisfied. Therefore, the values of `dp` remain unchanged, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration without any alterations to `dp`. 

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is 7, `i` is 48, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and the values of `dp` remain unchanged.**
