Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is at least 3, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. There are no changes to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`, but the preconditions remain unchanged.***
