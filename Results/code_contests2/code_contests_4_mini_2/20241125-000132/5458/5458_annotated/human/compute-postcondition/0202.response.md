Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` (equal to `m`) is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed using the modulo operation on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` after applying the modulo operation. Throughout these operations, `s` remains greater than or equal to 2 and `k` remains equal to 2.***
