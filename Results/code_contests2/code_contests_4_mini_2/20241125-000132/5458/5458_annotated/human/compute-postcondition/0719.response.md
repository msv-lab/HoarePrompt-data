According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and `s`. The loop ranges from `1` to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `3`, and `s` is between `1` and `3000`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s + 1`. Since `k` is currently `3`, for the loop to continue, `s` must be at least `3`, allowing `k` to take on the value `4`.

Thus, to enable the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the condition for `s` to ensure it is at least `3`. 

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is 3**
