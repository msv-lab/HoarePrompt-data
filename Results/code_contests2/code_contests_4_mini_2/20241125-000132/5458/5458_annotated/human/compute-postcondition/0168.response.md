Postcondition: ***`dp` remains unchanged unless `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The dimensions of `dp` are updated depending on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, while ensuring that `s` is at least 2 and `k` is 2.***
