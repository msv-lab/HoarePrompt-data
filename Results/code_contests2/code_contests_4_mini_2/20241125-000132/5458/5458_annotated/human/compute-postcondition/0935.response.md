The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being assigned the value `1`. Given that `i` is `0`, `j` is equal to `m`, and `k` is `1`, we need to evaluate the indices used in the assignment:

1. `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1` which results in `1`.
2. `j + 1` is equal to `m + 1` since `j` is equal to `m`.

Thus, the assignment `dp[1][m + 1][1] = 1` takes place. The other variables `dp`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged in value, but `dp[1][m + 1][1]` is updated to `1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [1][m + 1][1] to 1; `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1)**.
