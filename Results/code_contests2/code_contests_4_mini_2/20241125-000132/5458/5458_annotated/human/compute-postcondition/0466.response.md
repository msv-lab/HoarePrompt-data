Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to the `dp` array. In the else case, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and also includes a contribution from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. In all cases, the constraints on `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` hold, ensuring the values remain within the specified ranges.***
