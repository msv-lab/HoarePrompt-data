Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues without any changes to the variables. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the state of the variables remains unchanged, as there is no else part to modify them.***
