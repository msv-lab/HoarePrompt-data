Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is 7, `k` is 2, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without modifying any variables. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no specific action is taken as there is no else part defined.***
