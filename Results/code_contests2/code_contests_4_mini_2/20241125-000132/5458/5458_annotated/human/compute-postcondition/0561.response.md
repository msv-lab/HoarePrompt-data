The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` indicates that we are updating a specific value within the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. However, since it is stated that the code inside the if block is not executed, the assignment or modification to the `dp` array does not occur. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

The initial conditions indicate that:
- `i` is less than `n` (meaning `i` can take any value from 0 to `n-1`).
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1, which implies `m` can be any value starting from 1.
- `j` is greater than or equal to 1, indicating that `j` can also take any value starting from 1.
- `s` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `s` can be any value starting from 1.
- `k` is fixed at 2.

Since there are no changes to the variables due to the non-execution of the code inside the if block, we summarize the output state with the existing values and conditions.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and the code inside the if block is not executed.**
