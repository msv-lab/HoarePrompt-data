Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[1][m + 2][2]` remains unchanged. In the else part, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][m + 2][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][m + 1][2]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][m + 2][2]` is updated based on the modulo operation involving `dp[1][m + 1][2]` and `dp[0][m + 1][k - j]`, ensuring that the values of `dp` are adjusted appropriately based on the conditions met.***
