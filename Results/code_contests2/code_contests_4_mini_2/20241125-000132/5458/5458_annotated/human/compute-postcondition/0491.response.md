Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is equal to 2, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, the values of `dp` are updated based on the conditions of `j` relative to `k`.***
