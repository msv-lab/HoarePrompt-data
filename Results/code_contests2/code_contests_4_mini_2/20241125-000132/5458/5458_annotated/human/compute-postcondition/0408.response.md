Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program would proceed with the next steps of execution, thus preserving the state of the relevant variables.***
