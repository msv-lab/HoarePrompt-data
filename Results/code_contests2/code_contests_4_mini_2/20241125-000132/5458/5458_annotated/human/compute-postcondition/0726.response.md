Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value of 1; otherwise, no changes are made to the `dp` array.***
