Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` remains unchanged and is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions; specifically, it is set to `dp[0][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`, or it increases by `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod` if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, ensuring all scenarios where `j` and `k` interact are covered.***
