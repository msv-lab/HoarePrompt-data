The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the loop to skip the rest of its current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state retains the values of the variables as they were before the statement was executed.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is 2, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
