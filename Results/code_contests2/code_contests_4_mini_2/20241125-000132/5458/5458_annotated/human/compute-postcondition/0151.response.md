Postcondition: ***`dp` remains unchanged except for the case where `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1); in this case, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. Additionally, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0 throughout the execution.***
