Output State: **`dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k` for values from 1 to `s`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 during the first iteration. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be computed by adding the modular results of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The final value of `dp` depends on the iterations and conditions met during each execution of the loop. If `s` is 0 or negative, then `dp` remains unchanged.**
