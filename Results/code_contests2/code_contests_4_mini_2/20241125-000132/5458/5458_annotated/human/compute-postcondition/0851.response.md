Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 and less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than 3, the program does not modify `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
