Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 2 and 3000, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, the state of `dp` remains unchanged, but the exact state cannot be determined without knowing `i`.***
