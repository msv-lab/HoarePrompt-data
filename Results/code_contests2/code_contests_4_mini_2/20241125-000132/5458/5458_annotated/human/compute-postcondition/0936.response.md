Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated at index [1][m + 1][1] to 1 if `j` (which is equal to `m`) is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1). Additionally, `m` is incremented by 1, `k` remains 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp`.***
