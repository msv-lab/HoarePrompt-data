According to the code, the loop iterates for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be incremented from its current value of 1 to 2, ensuring that it remains within the bounds defined by `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. Since `s` is at least 1, `k` can be incremented to 2. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `k` is now 2. The other states (`i`, `n`, `m`, `j`, and `s`) do not need to be modified for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2**
