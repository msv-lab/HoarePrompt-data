Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `m`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration, while the values of `s`, `i`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute the if block and continues with the next iteration without modifying `dp`.***
