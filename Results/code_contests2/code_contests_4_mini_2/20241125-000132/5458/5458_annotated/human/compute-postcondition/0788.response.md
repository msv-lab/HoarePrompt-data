The code updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The operation only occurs if `j` is greater than `k`. Since the initial state mentions `k` is equal to `k + 1`, it implies that `k` cannot be less than or equal to `j` (given `j` is at least 1). Therefore, in this case, `j` is always less than or equal to `k`, and no changes are made to `dp`. Consequently, the output state reflects that the values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, `k` is equal to `k + 1`, and no changes are made to `dp`.**
