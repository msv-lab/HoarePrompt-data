Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 if `i` equals 0, or equal to `m + 1` and greater than 1 if `i` is greater than 0, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the values preceding it and updated accordingly, taking care to apply modulo operations as needed.***
