The statement `continue` affects the flow of control in a loop. It does not change the values of the variables `n`, `m`, or `s`. The loop will continue to the next iteration without executing the remaining code in the loop body. Therefore, the output state is that the values of `n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `s` is between 1 and 3000; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
