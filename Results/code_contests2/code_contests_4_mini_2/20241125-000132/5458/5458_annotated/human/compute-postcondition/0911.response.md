According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. Given that `s` is between 1 and 3000, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2. There are no other states that need to be adjusted because the values of `s`, `m`, `n`, and `j` are not specified to change based on the loop condition.

State: **Given that `s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is 7, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2.**
