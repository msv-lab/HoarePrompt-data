According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is 3. The loop will execute one more time if `k` can be incremented to 4, and `s` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue executing.

Currently, `s` is between 1 and 3000, which is wide enough to allow for the increment of `k`. Since `k` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 4.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 and less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is 4**
