The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop in which it is placed. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, we maintain the existing values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and the assignment regarding `dp` remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `s` is between 1 and 3000; `k` is less than `s`; and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
