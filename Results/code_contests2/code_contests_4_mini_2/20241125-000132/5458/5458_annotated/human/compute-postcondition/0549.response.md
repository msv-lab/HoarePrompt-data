The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
