The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the program will move on to the next iteration of the loop that contains this statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, reflecting the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is 7, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1), and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
