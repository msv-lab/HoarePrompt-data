Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, subject to the conditions that `j` must be greater than `k` for the first branch or the values of `dp` must be properly computed from previous states for the second branch. The conditions ensure that all possible states of `dp` are appropriately addressed based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
