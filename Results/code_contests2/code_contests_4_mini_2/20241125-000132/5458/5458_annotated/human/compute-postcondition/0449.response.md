According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s` since it is iterating from 1 to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be updated to the next value, which would be `k + 1`. 

Since `k` is iterating over the range starting from 1, we need to ensure that `k + 1` is still within the bounds of `s`. As `s` is stated to be between 1 and 3000, if `k` is currently at its maximum possible value of `s`, the next iteration would not be valid. However, since we are not given the exact value of `k`, we can only say that it needs to be increased by 1.

Thus, the adjustments to the states would be:
- `k` should be updated to `k + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted because the other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `dp`) do not change based on the loop's iteration.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list, `k` is between 2 and s + 1.**
