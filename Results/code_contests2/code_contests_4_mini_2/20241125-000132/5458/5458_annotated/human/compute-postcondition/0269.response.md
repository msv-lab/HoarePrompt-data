The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][s - j]`, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][s - j]`, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
