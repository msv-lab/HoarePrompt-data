Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to the `dp` list. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, thus modifying the `dp` list accordingly.***
