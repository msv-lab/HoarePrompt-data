The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next step in the logic where we are currently positioned. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration**.
