Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 3 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[1][2][3]` is updated based on the calculation involving `dp[0][1][2]` and `dp[0][1][k - j]`, taking into account the modulo operation with `mod`. The array `dp` is modified accordingly based on the specified conditions.***
