To evaluate the state at the end of the previous iteration and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the provided conditions.

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in xrange(n ** 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute `n ** 2` times, starting with `i` at 0 and incrementing by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n ** 2 - 1`.

If we want the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is currently at `n ** 2 - 1`, then it will not execute again unless `n` is increased, as `i` would become `n ** 2` in the next iteration, which is out of bounds.

Since we are not given specific values for `n`, we can determine the necessary adjustment:

- If `i` is currently `n ** 2 - 1`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be increased to `n + 1`, which would make `n ** 2` greater than `i` in the next iteration.

Thus, the adjusted state needs to reflect that `n` has been increased by 1, which affects `n ** 2` and hence the possibility of `i` being less than `n ** 2` for another iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is defined, `s` is at least 1, `i` is `n ** 2`, `j` remains as defined, and `k` remains as defined, `n` is increased by 1**
