Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to 1, and `k` is equal to 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]` is set to 1. There is no change to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`, but since `j` is initialized to 1 and `k` is equal to 2, this condition will not be satisfied in the current context.***
