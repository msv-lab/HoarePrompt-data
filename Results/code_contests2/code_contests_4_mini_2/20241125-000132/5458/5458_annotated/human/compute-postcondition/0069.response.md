Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 2 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and the process continues with the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there are no changes to the state, and the control moves to the next iteration without executing any updates.***
