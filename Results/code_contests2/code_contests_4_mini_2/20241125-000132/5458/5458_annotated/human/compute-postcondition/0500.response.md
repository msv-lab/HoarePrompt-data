Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is equal to 3, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Overall, the changes to `dp` depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and their comparisons to `k`.***
