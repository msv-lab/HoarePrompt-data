The statement updates the `dp` array at the index `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`, adding the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The values of `s`, `m`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly modified by this operation. However, the impact of this code line results in the update of a specific position in the `dp` array.

Since the specific values of `dp` are not provided, we can only refer to the indices affected and the operation performed. The output state retains the ranges and conditions for the variables as provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 if `i` equals 0, or equal to `m + 1` and greater than 1 if `i` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**.
