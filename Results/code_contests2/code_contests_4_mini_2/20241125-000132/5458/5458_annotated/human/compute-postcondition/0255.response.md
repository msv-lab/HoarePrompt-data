The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific location in the `dp` array. The indices used for this assignment are affected as follows:

- `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to `1`.
- `j` is `m + 1`, which is at least `2` (since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is `1`). Therefore, `j + 1` is at least `3`.
- `k` is `1`, which directly affects the third index of the assignment.

This means the assignment is to `dp[1][j + 1][1]`, where `j + 1` is at least `3`. 

The other variables remain unchanged, and since `dp` has been modified, we note that the state of `dp` is affected.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1**
