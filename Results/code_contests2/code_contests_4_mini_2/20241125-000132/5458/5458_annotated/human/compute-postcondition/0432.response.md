According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. The loop starts at `j = 1` and continues until `j = m`. At the end of the last iteration, if `s` is at least 1, this implies the loop has executed. We also know that `j` is currently `m + 1`, which would mean the loop cannot execute again, as `j` exceeds `m`.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be adjusted to be at least `m + 1` (which is not possible since `m` cannot increase during the loop) or `j` must be reset back to `1` for a new iteration. However, since `j` is currently `m + 1`, there is no further execution possible without changing `m`.

Thus, if we want the loop to execute one more time, we need to set the state such that `j` can start from 1 again, which effectively means no adjustments to `m`, but explicitly stating that `j` can be reset for another execution.

State: **If `s` is at least 1, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions described, `j` is reset to 1, and `m` remains unchanged**.
