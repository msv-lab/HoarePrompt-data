The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but it is noted that `k` is less than `s`. This operation does not change the state of `s`, `m`, or `n`, and only updates the value in the `dp` structure based on its previous state.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, `k` is less than `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
