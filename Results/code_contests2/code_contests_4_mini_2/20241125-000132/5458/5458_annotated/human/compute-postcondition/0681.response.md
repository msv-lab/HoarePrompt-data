Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `k` is between 2 and `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, we copy the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the given statement, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
