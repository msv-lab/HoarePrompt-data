The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `i` is currently `0`, so `i + 1 & 1` computes to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. The variable `j` is greater than or equal to `1`, and `k` is `2`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the change that occurred.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`**
