Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated such that if `j` is greater than `k` (where `k` is 2), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no updates are made to `dp` for this condition. Additionally, `m` has been incremented by 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1.***
