Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is at least 1, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the `dp` array. If `i` is 48, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1, `dp[1][2][1]` is updated by `dp[0][1][0] % mod`, and the value of `dp[1][2][1]` is also increased based on the conditions that involve `j` and `k`. Specifically, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][2][1]` retains its previous value from `dp[1][1][1]`. Otherwise, it is updated based on a modulo operation involving `dp[0][1][0]`. Therefore, the `dp` array is modified based on the values of `j` and `k` in both branches of the if-else statement.***
