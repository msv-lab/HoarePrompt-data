The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply moves the execution to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop, if there is one. Since there are no variables affected by this statement, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][2]**.
