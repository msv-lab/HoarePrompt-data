The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modifies the `dp` list based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. `i` is 1, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0` (since 2 & 1 is 0).
2. `j` is greater than `k`, and since `k` is 1, `j` can take any value greater than 1.
3. The value at `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[0][j][k]`.

Since `j` is greater than `k`, we do not know the exact value of `j`, but it will be at least 2. The value of `k` is 1.

Thus, after executing the code, the following updates occur in the `dp` array:
- The value at `dp[0][j + 1][1]` is updated to be equal to the value at `dp[0][j][1]`.

The states of variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged:

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0.**
