Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is 7, `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures all cases of `j` relative to `k` are covered, maintaining the specified conditions of `s`, `m`, `n`, and `k`.***
