Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and since `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute the if statement and continues to the next iteration without any changes to `dp`.**
