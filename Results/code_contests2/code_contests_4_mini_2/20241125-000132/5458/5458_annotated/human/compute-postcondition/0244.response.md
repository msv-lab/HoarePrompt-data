The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables directly. It simply skips the current iteration of the closest enclosing loop and continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, but we note that we are skipping the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
