The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but we know that `j` is 1 and `k` is at least 1. The previous state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains 0, and since `k - j` would be `k - 1`, we need to check the value of `dp[i & 1][1][k - 1]` to compute the result.

As a result, the output state reflects the update to the `dp` list based on the computed values. Thus, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - 1] % mod`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - 1] % mod`**
