Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute any statement and proceeds without modifications to the data.***
