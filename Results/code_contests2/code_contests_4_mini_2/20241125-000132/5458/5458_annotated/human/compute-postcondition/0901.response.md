The statement modifies a multidimensional array `dp` at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given the initial state, we can analyze the indices:

- `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1. The value of `1 & 1` is 1.
- `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, which means `j` is at least 1. Thus, `j + 1` is at least 2.
- `k` is 1.

The assignment `dp[1][j + 1][1] = 1` sets the value at that particular position in the `dp` array to 1, but it does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `s`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `j`, along with the fact that the `dp` array has been modified.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is 7, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1**
