According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop continues as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, `k` should be adjusted to 2, while `s` remains unchanged. 

State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2**
