According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` in relation to `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is between 3 and 3000. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4. Since `s` is at least 3, it is still valid for `k` to be 4.

No other states need to be adjusted because `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j` do not directly impact the loop's ability to execute again in this context.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 3 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 4**
