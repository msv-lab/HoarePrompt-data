The code assigns the value `1` to the element of the `dp` array at the indices calculated as follows: `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1` which is `1` (since `i` is `0`), `j + 1` evaluates to `2` (since `j` is `1`), and `k` remains `3`. Therefore, the assignment targets `dp[1][2][3]`. Other variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected. 

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 3 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][2][3]` is set to 1.**
