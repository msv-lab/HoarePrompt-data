Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`, or is calculated as `dp[0][j][k] % mod + dp[0][j][k - j] % mod` if `j` is less than or equal to `k`.***
