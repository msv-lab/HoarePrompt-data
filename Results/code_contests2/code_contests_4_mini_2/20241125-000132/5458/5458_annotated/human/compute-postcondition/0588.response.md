According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop iterates with `k` ranging from 1 to `s` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1, which means the loop can execute again if `k` is less than `s`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, it is possible that `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, we adjust `k` to be 2, and ensure that `s` is at least 2.

State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2**
