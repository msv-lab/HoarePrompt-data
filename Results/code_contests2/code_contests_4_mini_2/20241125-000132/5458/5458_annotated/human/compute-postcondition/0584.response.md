Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
