The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but we know that `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1, and `k` is equal to 1. The state of other variables (`n`, `m`, and `s`) is not directly affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, while noting that the `dp` structure has been updated. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
