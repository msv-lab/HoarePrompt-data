Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 0 or 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is equal to or greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, then for `j` equal to 2, `dp` is updated based on the previous values of `dp` as per the specified operations. The function handles cases where `j` is exactly equal to `k` without specific action for when `j` is less than `k`.
