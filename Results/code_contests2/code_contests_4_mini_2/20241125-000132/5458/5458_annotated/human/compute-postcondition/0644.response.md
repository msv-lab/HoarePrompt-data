According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n` and `m` must be at least 1, and `s` must be at least 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`, and we know that `m` is at least 1 and `s` is at least 1. Since `i` can progress through its range, it needs to be incremented for the next iteration. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `i` has been incremented by 1.

No other states need to be adjusted as `m` and `s` are already valid for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i` is one less than `n`, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1**
