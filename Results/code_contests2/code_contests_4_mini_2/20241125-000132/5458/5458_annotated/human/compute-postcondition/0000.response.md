The statement assigns the value `100000` to the variable `mod`. The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 7 (inclusive), `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), `S` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000 (inclusive), and `mod` is 100000.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 7 (inclusive), `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), `S` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000 (inclusive), and `mod` is 100000**
