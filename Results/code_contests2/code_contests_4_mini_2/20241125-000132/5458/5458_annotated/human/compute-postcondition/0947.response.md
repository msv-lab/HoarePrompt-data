Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 2). Additionally, if `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `j`, and `m` are such that `m` is incremented by 1, and the initial condition states that `m` is at least 1 when `i` is 0. If `i` is not 0, and `m` is greater than 1, the updates to `dp` are based on previous values. The overall state of the program reflects these conditions and updates accordingly.***
