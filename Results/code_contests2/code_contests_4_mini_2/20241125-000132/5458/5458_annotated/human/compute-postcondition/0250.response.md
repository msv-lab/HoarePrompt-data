Output State: **If `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute `s` times, and `k` will range from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, if `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `s` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged.**
