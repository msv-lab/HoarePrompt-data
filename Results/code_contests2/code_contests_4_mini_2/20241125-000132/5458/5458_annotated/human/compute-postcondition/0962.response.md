Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Throughout these updates, `m` is incremented by 1, `s` remains greater than or equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is equal to `m + 1`.***
