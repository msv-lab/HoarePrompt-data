According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `k` is `s + 1`. Since the loop runs as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted to be equal to `s + 1`, which is the value that allows the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be set to `s + 1` (as it is currently).
- `s` remains unchanged as it is already in the valid range.

State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 if `i` equals 0, or equal to `m + 1` and greater than 1 if `i` is greater than 0, and `k` is `s + 1`**
