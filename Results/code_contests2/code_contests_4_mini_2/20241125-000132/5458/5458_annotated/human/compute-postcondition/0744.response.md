According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. In the previous iteration, `k` is equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. The other states (`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `i`) do not need to be adjusted since they are not directly affected by the loop's execution in this specific context. 

Thus, the only necessary adjustment is to `k`. 

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is initialized to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is equal to 3**
