Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 3 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][3]` is set to `dp[1][1][3]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes to `dp` occur, leaving it unchanged.***
