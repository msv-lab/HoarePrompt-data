In the provided code snippet, the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` is evaluating an index and assigning a value. 

1. The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1.
2. The expression `1 & 1` will evaluate to 1 (since bitwise AND of 1 and 1 is 1).
3. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to 2, so `j + 1` will be at least 3.
4. The value of `k` is 1.

Thus, the assignment will be made to `dp[1][j + 1][1]`, where `j + 1` is at least 3.

Other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
