Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7 (inclusive), `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), and `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000 (inclusive). If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, there is no effect on the state of `n`, `m`, and `s`.***
