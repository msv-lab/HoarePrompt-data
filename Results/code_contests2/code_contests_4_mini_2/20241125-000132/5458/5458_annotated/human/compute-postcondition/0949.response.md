The code snippet `continue` indicates that the program will skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. 

In this context:
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `k` being 2 and `m` incremented by 1, but since the `continue` statement is executed, the program will not complete the current iteration of the loop and will thus not execute any further code within that iteration.

The values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `m` do not change as a result of the `continue` statement, and no variables are returned. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are still within the loop, and the program will continue to the next iteration without affecting the current values.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `k` being 2 and `m` incremented by 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
