Postcondition: ***`dp` remains unchanged, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without modifying any variables. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the if block, and the state remains unchanged.***
