Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is 7, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without executing any further statements, and the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no actions are taken and the program will proceed with its subsequent logic.***
