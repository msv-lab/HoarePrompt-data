Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 if `i` equals 0, and `j` is equal to `m + 1` and greater than 1 if `i` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k` when `i` is greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The overall state of `dp` reflects these updates accordingly.***
