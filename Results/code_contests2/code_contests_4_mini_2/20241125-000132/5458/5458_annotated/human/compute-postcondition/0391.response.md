The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is in and move to the next iteration instead. Since no variable updates are made, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
