Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, and `s` is an integer between 1 and 3000. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since the precondition states that `n` cannot be 0, this condition will never be met, and thus the program will not break.***
