The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop that we are currently in. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
