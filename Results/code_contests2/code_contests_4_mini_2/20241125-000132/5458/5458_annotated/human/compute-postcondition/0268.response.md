The operation assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` influence the state of the `dp` array, while the other variables remain unchanged. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is copied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, but we do not have the specific values of these `dp` elements. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment operation.

Output State: **`i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][s - j]`, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
