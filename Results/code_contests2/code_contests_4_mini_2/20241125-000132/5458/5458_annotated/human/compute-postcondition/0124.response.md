The code modifies the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Specifically:

1. The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
2. The state of `dp` is affected only if the condition `j > k` is not met. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, meaning it does not update with the addition.

Since `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` do not directly influence the `dp` values in this snippet, we focus on the relationship between `j` and `k`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `j` is not greater than `k`, otherwise `dp` values remain unchanged**.
