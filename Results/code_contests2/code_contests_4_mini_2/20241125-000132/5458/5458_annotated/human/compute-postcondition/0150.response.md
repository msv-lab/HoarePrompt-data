The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index in the `dp` array. The indices used are determined by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

- `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`.
- `j` is `m + 1`, which is unknown but is greater than or equal to `k` (which is `1`).
- Therefore, `j + 1` is at least `m + 2`, which is also unknown.
- `k` is `1`.

Thus, the assignment affects the `dp` variable but does not change any other variables. The output state should reflect the unchanged nature of `dp` and the specifics of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`dp` remains unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1.**
