According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 2, and `s` is between 1 and 3000. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 3, it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is equal to 3, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2**
