The line of code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `dp` remains unchanged overall, but the specific element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to match the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `s` and `k` do not change their values in this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` remains unchanged, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`dp` remains unchanged, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
