The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous state indicates that `dp` is updated as described, `m` is incremented by 1, `s` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is equal to `m + 1`. Additionally, since we are in a situation where `j` is not greater than `k`, the if block does not execute, and we proceed with the next iteration without modifying `dp`, `m`, or `k`.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `dp`, `m`, and `k`, but we now have the new assignment for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Output State: **`dp` is updated as described, `m` is incremented by 1, `s` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is equal to `m + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**.
