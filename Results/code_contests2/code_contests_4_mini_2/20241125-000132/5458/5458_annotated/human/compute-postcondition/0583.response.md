The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
