According to the code, whether the for loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 3, and `s` is at least 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `k` should now be 4 in the next iteration. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `s` also needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is at least 4 to include the next value of `k`. 

Therefore, the adjustment that needs to be made is that `s` should be at least 4.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `m`, and `k` is 4**
