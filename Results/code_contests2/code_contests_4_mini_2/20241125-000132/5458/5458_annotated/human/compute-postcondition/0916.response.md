Postcondition: ***Given that `s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is 7, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2, if `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, leaving the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` unchanged as it is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program will not execute the if block, and the state of the variables remains unaffected.***
