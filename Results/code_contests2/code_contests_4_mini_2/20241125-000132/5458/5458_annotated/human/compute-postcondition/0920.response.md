According to the code, the for loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, where `s` is between 1 and 3000. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. Since `s` is at least 1, `k` can execute again as long as `k` is less than `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. 

Thus, the states to be adjusted are:

- `k` should be updated to 3.

There are no other states that need to be adjusted based on the information provided.

State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is 7, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3**.
