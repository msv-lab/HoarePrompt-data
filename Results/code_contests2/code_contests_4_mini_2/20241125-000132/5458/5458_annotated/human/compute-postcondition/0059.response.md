The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no specific loop context or additional variable updates are provided, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 2 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned to `dp[1][2][2]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
