The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables and instead skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. The values of `s`, `m`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 if `i` equals 0, and `j` is equal to `m + 1` and greater than 1 if `i` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 if `i` equals 0, and `j` is equal to `m + 1` and greater than 1 if `i` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
