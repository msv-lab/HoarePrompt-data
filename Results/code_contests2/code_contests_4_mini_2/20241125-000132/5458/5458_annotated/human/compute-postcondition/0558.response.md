The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next one. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the continuation of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
