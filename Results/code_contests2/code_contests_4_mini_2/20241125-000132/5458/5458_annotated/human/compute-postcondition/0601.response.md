The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. The values of `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables and acknowledges the continuation of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
