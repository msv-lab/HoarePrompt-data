According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is between 1 and 3000. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented. Since the loop runs while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, and `k` is currently 3, it can execute again as long as `s` is at least 4.

At this point, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`, which should be updated to 4 to reflect the next iteration of the loop. The value of `s`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged since they do not directly affect the loop's next iteration.

State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is 7, `k` is 4**
