Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is between 1 and 3000. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the `dp` array remains unchanged. If `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute `s` times, updating `dp` based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. After the loop executes, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to equal `dp[1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the values from previous states, ensuring all updates respect the modulus operation. The loop may not execute if `s` is less than 1, resulting in no changes to `dp`, while if `s` is 1 or more, `dp` will reflect the derived values based on `j` and `k`.**
