The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables do not change due to the `continue` statement, but it indicates that we are moving on to the next iteration of the loop we are currently in. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are still within the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
