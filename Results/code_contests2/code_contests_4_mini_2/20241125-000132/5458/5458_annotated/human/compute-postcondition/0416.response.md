The code contains a `continue` statement, which does not change any variable values or states. It only affects the flow of control in loops, causing the program to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Since the current values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables and indicates that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 2 and 3000, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
