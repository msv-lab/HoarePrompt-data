The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. However, it does not change the values of any variables or the overall state of the program. Given that `s`, `m`, `n`, and `k` maintain their initial states and no other variables are affected, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is 7, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
