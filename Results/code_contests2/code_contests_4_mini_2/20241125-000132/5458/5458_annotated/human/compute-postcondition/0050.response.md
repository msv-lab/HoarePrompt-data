The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration within the loop in which it is placed. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is not 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
