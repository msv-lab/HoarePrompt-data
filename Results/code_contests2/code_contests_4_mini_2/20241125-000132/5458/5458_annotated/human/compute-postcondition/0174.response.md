Postcondition: ***`dp` remains unchanged, `s` is at least 2, `k` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the current state of `dp` remains unchanged, and the program proceeds without executing the if block.***
