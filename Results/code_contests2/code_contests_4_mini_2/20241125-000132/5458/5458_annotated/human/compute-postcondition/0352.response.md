Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[1][2][2]` remains unchanged. In the else part, `dp` remains a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list of zeros, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[1][2][2]` is copied from `dp[1][1][2]`. Otherwise, `dp[1][2][2]` is computed based on the values of `dp[1][1][2]` and `dp[0][1][0]`, ensuring that the values adhere to the modulus operation as defined by `mod`.***
