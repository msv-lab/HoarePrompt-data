According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4. Therefore, `k` needs to be adjusted to 4, and we also need to ensure that `s` is at least 4 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 4**
