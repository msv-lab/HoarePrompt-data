The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the remainder of the current loop iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`**
