Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, this condition is not satisfied, and the program will not execute any operations related to `dp` and will proceed to the next part of the loop without any changes to `dp`.***
