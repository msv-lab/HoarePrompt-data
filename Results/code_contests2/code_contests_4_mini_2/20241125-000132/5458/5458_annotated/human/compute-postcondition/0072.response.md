Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 2 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp[1][3][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][k]` is set to `dp[1][2][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][k]` is updated by taking `dp[1][2][k]` modulo `mod` and adding `dp[0][2][k - j]` modulo `mod`. All modifications to `dp` are made based on the specified conditions and retain the constraints of the initial variables.***
