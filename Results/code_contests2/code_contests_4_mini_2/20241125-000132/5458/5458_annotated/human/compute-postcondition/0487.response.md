The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
