Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` remains unchanged and is equal to 0, `k` is now 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to the value of `dp[1][j][2]`, otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[0][j][2 - j]` modulo `mod`. This accounts for cases where `j` is equal to or less than `k`, ensuring all possible scenarios are covered.***
