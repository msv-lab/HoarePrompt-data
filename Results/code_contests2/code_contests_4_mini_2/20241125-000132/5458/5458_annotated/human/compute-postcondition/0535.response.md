According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for each value of `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `k` is currently 3, which means that the loop has executed for `k` values of 1, 2, and 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4, and in order for the loop to run, `s` must be at least 4 (since the loop runs while `k` is less than or equal to `s`).

Currently, `s` is at least 3, so for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be adjusted to be at least 4.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 4, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 4.**
