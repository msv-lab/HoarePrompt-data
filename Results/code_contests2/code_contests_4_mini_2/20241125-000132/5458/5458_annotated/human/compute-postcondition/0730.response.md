The `continue` statement does not change the values of any of the variables, but it indicates that the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration will begin immediately. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
