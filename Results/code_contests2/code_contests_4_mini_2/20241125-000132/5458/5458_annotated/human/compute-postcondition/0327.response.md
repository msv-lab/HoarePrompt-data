Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), and `s` is an integer between 1 and 3000 (inclusive). If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since the precondition states that `n`, `m`, and `s` cannot be 0, this condition will never be met, and the program will continue executing beyond this point without breaking.***
