The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this line of code. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but `j` is incremented by 1 in the assignment. Since `j` starts at 1, the new value of `j + 1` will be 2. 

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `j` while maintaining the other variables as they are.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 2, `k` is 2**
