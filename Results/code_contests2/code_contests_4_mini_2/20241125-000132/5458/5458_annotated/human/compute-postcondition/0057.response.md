Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 2 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1; otherwise, there are no changes to the state of `dp`.***
