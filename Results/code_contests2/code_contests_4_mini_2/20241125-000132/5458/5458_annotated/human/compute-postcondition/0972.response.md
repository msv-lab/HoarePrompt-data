The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly; instead, it reads input values for `N`, `M`, and `S`. The constraints are that `N` is an integer between 1 and 7 (inclusive), `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), and `S` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000 (inclusive). The function continues to process input until all three values, `N`, `M`, and `S`, are zero. 

The output of the function is not specified in the prompt. However, based on the constraints and the fact that input processing continues until all inputs are zero, it can be inferred that the function likely performs some operations based on valid inputs of `N`, `M`, and `S`.

Functionality: **The function processes inputs for integers N (1-7), M (1-2000), and S (1-3000), continuing until N, M, and S are all zero. The specific output is not detailed in the prompt.**
