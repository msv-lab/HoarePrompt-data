The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop, allowing the next iteration to begin immediately. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes were made to the variables, but indicates that the loop continues execution.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is at least 1 and less than 48, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
