The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The affected variables are `dp` and the indices depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but it is understood that `i` is either 0 or 1 (from the operation `i + 1 & 1`), and `j` is within the range defined by `m`.

Since the exact values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact values in the `dp` list after the assignment. However, we can summarize the state by noting that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with the value from index [i + 1 & 1][j][k], `k` is between 2 and s + 1**
