Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, which means `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
