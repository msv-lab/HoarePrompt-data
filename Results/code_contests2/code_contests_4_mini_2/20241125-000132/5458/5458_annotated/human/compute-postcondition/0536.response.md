Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is at least 3, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is greater than or equal to 2. The loop executes for values of `k` from 1 to `s`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, leaving `dp` unchanged. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` (if that index is valid) to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than `k` and `i` is equal to 0, `dp` remains unchanged. If `k` exceeds `s`, the loop also does not execute, leaving `dp` unchanged.**
