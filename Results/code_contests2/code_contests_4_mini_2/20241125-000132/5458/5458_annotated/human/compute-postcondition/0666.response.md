Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is between 1 and 3000. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated to be equal to `dp[1][j][1]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated based on `dp[1][j][1] % mod` and `dp[0][j][0]` is added, ensuring that all updates respect the modulus operation.***
