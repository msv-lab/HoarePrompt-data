The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there are no modifications to the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, or `dp` in this statement, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop continues without any changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and the loop continues without changes.**
