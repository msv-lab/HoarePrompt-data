The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either `0` or `1` depending on whether `i` is even or odd. The values of `j` and `k` are known to be `2` and `1`, respectively.

Let's break this down:

1. The value of `i` is not `0`, so it is either positive.
2. The operation `i + 1 & 1` will yield either `0` (if `i` is odd) or `1` (if `i` is even).
3. The value `j + 1` is `3` since `j` is `2`.
4. The value of `k` is `1`.

Thus, we are effectively accessing `dp[0 or 1][3][1]` and assigning it the value of `dp[0 or 1][2][1]`.

Since the specific values of `dp` are not provided, we focus on the fact that the assignment is made from one element of `dp` to another, without changing the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, or `k`.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the assignment in the `dp` array.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is not 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`; the assignment is made in the `dp` array.**
