Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `k`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. There are no changes to the state of the program if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
