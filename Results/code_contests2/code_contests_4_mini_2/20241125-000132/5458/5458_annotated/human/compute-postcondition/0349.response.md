Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list of zeros. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2. The program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there are no updates to `dp`, and the program continues execution from this point.***
