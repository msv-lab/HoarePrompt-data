Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the `dp` array.***
