Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 and less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is between 1 and `s`. If the loop executes, it will run for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`, updating `dp` based on the conditions provided. If `s` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than 3, the loop will not execute due to the condition on `j`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp` will be updated according to the logic in the loop. Thus, after the loop execution, `dp` will reflect the computed values based on the conditions met during each iteration.**
