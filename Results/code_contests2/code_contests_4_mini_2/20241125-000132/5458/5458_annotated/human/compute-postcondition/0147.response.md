According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1. Given that `s` is already stated to be at least 1 and `j` is set to `m + 1`, the initialization of `k` can start at 1.

State: **`dp` remains unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
