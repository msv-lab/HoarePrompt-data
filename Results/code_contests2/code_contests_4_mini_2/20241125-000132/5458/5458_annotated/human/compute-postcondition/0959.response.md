Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated as described, `m` is incremented by 1, `s` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is equal to `m + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the if block but proceeds with the next iteration without modifying `dp`, `m`, or `k`.***
