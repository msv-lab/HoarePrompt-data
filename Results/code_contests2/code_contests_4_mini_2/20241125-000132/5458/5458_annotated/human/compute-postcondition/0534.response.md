Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Overall, the `dp` array may be updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`, with specific updates depending on the values of these variables.***
