Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. `m` is incremented by 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, ensuring that `k` remains equal to `m + 1`. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, `m`, `s`, or `k`.***
