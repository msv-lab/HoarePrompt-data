According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4, and `s` must be at least 4 (since `s` is between 1 and 3000, it's already satisfied). Therefore, we only need to adjust the value of `k`.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is equal to 4, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2**
