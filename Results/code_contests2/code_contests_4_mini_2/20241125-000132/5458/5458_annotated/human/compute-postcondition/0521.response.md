The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration if applicable. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state since no variables are altered.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is at least 3, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
