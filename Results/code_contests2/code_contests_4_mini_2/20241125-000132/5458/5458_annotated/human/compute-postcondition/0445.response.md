Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. In case `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the execution would proceed with the next set of instructions outside this if statement.***
