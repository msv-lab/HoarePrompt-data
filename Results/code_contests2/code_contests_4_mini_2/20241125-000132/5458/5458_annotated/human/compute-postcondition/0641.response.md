Output State: **If `s` is at least 1, then after the loop executes `s` times, `k` will be equal to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 for all iterations. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. If `s` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute, and `k` will not change, remaining undefined or at its initial value.**
