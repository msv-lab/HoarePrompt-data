According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is between 1 and 3000. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to 2. Since `s` is between 1 and 3000, it is still valid for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 2, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2.**
