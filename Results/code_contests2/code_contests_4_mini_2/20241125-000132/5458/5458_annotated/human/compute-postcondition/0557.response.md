The code statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns a value from one position in the `dp` array to another. The specific indices used in this assignment depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` calculates the bitwise AND of `i + 1` and `1`, which results in either `0` or `1`, depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd. This means that the first index for `dp` will be either `0` or `1`.
2. `j + 1` simply increments the value of `j` by `1` for the second index of `dp`.
3. `k` is already given as `2`, so the third index remains constant.

The assignment copies the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific values of `dp` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values being assigned.

Since the other variables (`i`, `j`, and `k`) are not changed by this operation, and we do not have specific values for the `dp` array, the output state will remain focused on the conditions and the assignment operation.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
