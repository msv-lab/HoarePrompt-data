Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k` and `i` is still 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `dp` are modified based on these conditions, ensuring that all edge cases regarding the relationships between `i`, `j`, and `k` are accounted for.***
