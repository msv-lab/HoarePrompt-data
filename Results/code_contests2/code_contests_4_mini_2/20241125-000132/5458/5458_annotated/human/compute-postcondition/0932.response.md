According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `s + 1`. The variable `k` will start at 1 before the first iteration of the loop. 

Since `j` is `m` and `m` is `m + 1`, we understand that `j` could be any value depending on the value of `m`, but it doesn't affect the execution of the loop directly. We also have no specific information about the values of `i` and `j` that could impact the loop execution.

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the states are:
1. `s` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
2. Before the loop starts, `k` is initialized to 1.

State: **`dp` is updated based on the conditions pertaining to `i`, `j`, and `k`, `j` is m, `m` is m + 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
