Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the conditions pertaining to `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, where `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program continues execution.***
