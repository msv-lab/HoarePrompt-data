According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 3 and `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value. Since `j` is at least 3, it means that the next value will be 4. For the loop to execute with `j` being 4, `m` must be at least 4, as `j` cannot exceed `m`.

Given that `m` is at least 2, we can adjust the state to reflect that `m` must now be at least 4 for the loop to execute again, and `j` should be updated to 4 for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 4, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is 4, and `k` is between 1 and `s`.**
