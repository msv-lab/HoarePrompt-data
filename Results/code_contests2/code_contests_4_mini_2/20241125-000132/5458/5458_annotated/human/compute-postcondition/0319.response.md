According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop executes for `j` in the range from 1 to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.

At the end of the last iteration, since `j` is not provided, we need to consider the case where it would be `m` after the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to `m + 1`, and `m` must be at least 1. However, since we do not have information on `m`, we can only assert that `j` must be updated to `m + 1` for the loop to continue.

Thus, if `s` is at least 1, `j` was last set to 1, and `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to have executed. Therefore, we can state that `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time, and `j` must be set to 2 after the previous iteration.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
