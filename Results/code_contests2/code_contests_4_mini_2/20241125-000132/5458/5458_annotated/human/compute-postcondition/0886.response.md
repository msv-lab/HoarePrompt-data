According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 (the last value of `k` that was considered). Since `s` is between 1 and 3000, to execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. 

Thus, we need to adjust `k` to be 3, while `s` remains unchanged as it still allows for more iterations.

State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is 7, `k` is 3**
