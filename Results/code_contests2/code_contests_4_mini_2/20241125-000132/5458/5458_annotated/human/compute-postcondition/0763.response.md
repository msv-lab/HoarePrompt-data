Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and since `j` is equal to `k`, the value of `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. There are no other conditions or variable changes that affect the state of the program after the execution of the if statement.***
