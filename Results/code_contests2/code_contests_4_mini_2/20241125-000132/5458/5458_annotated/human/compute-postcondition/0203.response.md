According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `k` equal to 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` must become 3. Additionally, since `s` is greater than or equal to 2, we can ensure that `s` remains at least 3 for the next iteration. 

Thus, the adjusted states will be:
State: **`dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3**
