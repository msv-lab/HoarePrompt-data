The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` remains unchanged and is equal to 0, `k` is now 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
