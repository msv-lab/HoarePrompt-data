According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to iterate `n ** 2` times. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 48. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n ** 2`. Therefore, the state of `i` must change from 48 to 49 to allow for one more iteration. No other states need to be adjusted, as the other variables and conditions mentioned do not affect the loop execution in this context.

State: **`i` is 49**
