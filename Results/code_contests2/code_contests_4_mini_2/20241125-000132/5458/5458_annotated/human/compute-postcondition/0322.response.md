Output State: **If `n` is between 1 and 7 (inclusive), `m` is between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), and `s` is between 1 and 3000 (inclusive), then the loop executes `n^2` times. For each execution, `j` varies from 1 to `m`, and `k` varies from 1 to `s`. The values of `dp` are updated based on the conditions involving `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `s` is less than 1, or if `m` is less than 1, the loops do not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 1, the outer loop does not execute, leaving all variables unchanged, including `n`, `m`, and `s`. In all cases, `i` will take values from 0 to `n^2 - 1` throughout the loop execution.**
