The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves updating a multidimensional array `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

First, let's evaluate the indices:
- `i` is currently 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. The expression `1 & 1` results in 1 (since `1` in binary is `01` and `1` is `01`, and the bitwise AND gives `01`).
- `j` is currently 1, so `j + 1` equals 2.
- `k` remains 1.

Thus, the assignment modifies the array `dp` at the index `[1][2][1]`.

The values of `s`, `m`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unaffected by this assignment statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new assignment made to the `dp` array.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1**.
