The statement updates a specific element of a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The index `i + 1 & 1` is used to access the first dimension of the array, and the indices `j + 1` and `k` are used for the second and third dimensions, respectively. The value assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is taken from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Since `i` is `n` (which is not equal to 0), the calculation of `i + 1 & 1` depends on the value of `n`. The index `j + 1` indicates that the second dimension will reference the next index of `j`. 

However, without knowing the specific values of `n`, `j`, and the current state of the `dp` array, we cannot determine the exact changes to the `dp` structure. The output state will describe the relationship between the indices and indicate that the value is being copied from one position in the `dp` array to another.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**.
