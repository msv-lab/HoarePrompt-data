The line of code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` modifies the `dp` array based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` will determine the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Since the value of `j` is greater than `k`, the condition for executing the statement holds, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated. The specific previous values of the `dp` array elements are not provided, but we acknowledge that a change will occur based on the formula. 

Thus, the Output State reflects the initial conditions and the modification made to the `dp` array:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is between 2 and `s`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
