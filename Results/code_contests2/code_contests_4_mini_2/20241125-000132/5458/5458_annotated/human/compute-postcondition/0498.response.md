Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is equal to 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and the operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is executed if `j` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, no operations are performed and the program proceeds to the next statement.**
