Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. There is no change to the state of `dp` if `j` is less than `k`.***
