The line of code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` affects the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` determines which index to use for the first dimension of the `dp` array. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` evaluates to 1, and `1 & 1` equals 1. Therefore, the first index will be 1.
2. The value of `j` is 1, so `j + 1` evaluates to 2.
3. The value of `k` is 3 and remains unchanged.

The code assigns the value from `dp[1][1][3]` to `dp[1][2][3]`. The existing states of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` do not change, and this line of code does not specify the values in the `dp` array.

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the assignment in the `dp` array.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 3 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][2][3] = dp[1][1][3]`**
