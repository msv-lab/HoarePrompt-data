The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1` because `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` is `1`. 

Therefore, both the left-hand side and right-hand side of the assignment involve `dp[1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[1][j][k]`, respectively. The value of `j` is `1`, so `j + 1` becomes `2`. The variable `k` is `2`.

Thus, the assignment is: 
```
dp[1][2][2] = dp[1][1][2]
```

This means that the value at `dp[1][2][2]` is updated to whatever value was previously at `dp[1][1][2]`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` has been updated at dp[1][2][2] = dp[1][1][2], `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2**
