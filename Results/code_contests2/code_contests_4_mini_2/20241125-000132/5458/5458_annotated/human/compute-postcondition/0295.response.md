Postcondition: ***`i` is not equal to 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. No changes occur if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, as there is no else part to handle that condition.***
