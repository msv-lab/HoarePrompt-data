The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables directly, but it causes the program to skip the remaining code within the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no values are modified and we are inside a loop, the output state will reflect the current values of the variables without change.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7; `m` is between 1 and 2000; `s` is between 1 and 3000; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 0; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is 1; `k` is 1; and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration.**
