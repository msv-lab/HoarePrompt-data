Postcondition: ***`dp` remains unchanged except when `i` is 0 and `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), in which case `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. In the else case, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][1]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][0] % mod`, while `s` remains at least 1 and `k` remains 1 throughout the execution.***
