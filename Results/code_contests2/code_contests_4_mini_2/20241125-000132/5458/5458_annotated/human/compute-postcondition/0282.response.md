Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, and `k` is equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If the else part executes, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[1][j][k]` and `dp[0][j][k - j]`, ensuring that all calculations are performed modulo `mod`.***
