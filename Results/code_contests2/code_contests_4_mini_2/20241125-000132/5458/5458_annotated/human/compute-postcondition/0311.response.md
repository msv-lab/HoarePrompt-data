The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` will update a value in a multi-dimensional array `dp`. 

The value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`, and `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. The variable `j` is `m + 1`, but we donâ€™t have a specific value for `m`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `j`. However, `j + 1` would then be `m + 2`.

The variable `k` is `3`. 

Therefore, the code will assign the value from `dp[1][j][3]` to `dp[1][j + 1][3]`. The other variables (`i`, `s`, `j`, and `k`) remain unchanged. 

Since `j` has an indeterminate value based on `m`, we cannot provide a specific output for it, but we can express that an update occurs without changing its value.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][3]`**
