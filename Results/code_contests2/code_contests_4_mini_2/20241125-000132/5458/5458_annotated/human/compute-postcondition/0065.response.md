The code assigns the value `1` to the `dp` array at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`, and `k` is `3`, we can calculate the indices:

- For `i + 1 & 1`: 
  - `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`.

- For `j + 1`: 
  - `j + 1` is `3`.

Thus, we are setting `dp[1][3][k] = 1`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and the previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 2 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][3][k]` is set to 1**.
