Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains unchanged and is equal to 0. If `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), then `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is updated to match `dp[1][j][1]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is updated to `dp[1][j][1] % mod` plus `dp[0][j][0] % mod`, ensuring all possible transitions are accounted for. The program thus handles edge cases where `j` is equal to or less than 1 while still adhering to the unchanged conditions of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `i`.***
