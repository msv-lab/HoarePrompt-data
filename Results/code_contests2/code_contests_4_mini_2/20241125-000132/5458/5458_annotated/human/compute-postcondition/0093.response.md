The values of the variables do not change as `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop without affecting the variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` remains unchanged and is equal to 0, and the value at `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[1][j][k]`.
