To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given state conditions and the for loop statement.

1. The loop iterates with `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. 
2. Initially, `k` is set to 2 at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented.
3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is between 1 and 3000 (inclusive), it is necessary to ensure that `s` is greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

From the previous states:
- `s` is between 1 and 3000
- `k` is currently 2

To allow the loop to run one more time, `k` should be adjusted to 3. Since `s` must also allow for `k` to be a valid value, we can leave `s` as is because it is already stated to be between 1 and 3000, which covers the requirement.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` must be adjusted to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted since `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, and `j` is at least 3 and less than or equal to `m`.

State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 and less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is 3**
