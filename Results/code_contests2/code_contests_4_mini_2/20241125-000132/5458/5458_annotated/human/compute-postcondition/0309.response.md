The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the value in a 3D array `dp`. 

1. We need to evaluate `i + 1 & 1`. Here `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`. The bitwise `AND` operation `1 & 1` results in `1`. Therefore, the first index is `1`.
2. The value of `j` is `m + 1`, which is not explicitly stated, but `j` is defined as `m + 1`. As `m` is not given, we will denote `j + 1` simply as `m + 2`.
3. The value of `k` is `3`.

Thus, the assignment will set the value at `dp[1][m + 2][3]` to `1`. The other variables `i`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][m + 2][3]` is set to 1**.
