Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list of zeros, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][2][1]` is updated based on the values of `dp` from the previous indices, specifically `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][1] % mod` plus `dp[0][1][0] % mod`, ensuring that all operations respect the modulo condition. Additionally, if `k` is equal to `j`, the calculations involve utilizing the same index in the list, taking care of potential boundary scenarios.***
