Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` and the previous values of `dp`. This covers the cases where `j` is equal to `k`, as well as the values of `j` greater than or less than `k`.***
