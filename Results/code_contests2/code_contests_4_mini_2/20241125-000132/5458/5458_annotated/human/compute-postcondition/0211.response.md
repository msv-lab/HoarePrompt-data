Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and the constant `k` which is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to 3, and `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variable `s` is greater than or equal to 3, ensuring all conditions for the updates are satisfied, while indices remain valid throughout the operations performed on `dp`.***
