The statement `continue` does not change any variable's values but instead skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Since the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, the output state reflects that we are continuing in the loop without modifying any variables' states.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is between 2 and s + 1, and we continue in the nearest enclosing loop.**
