Output State: **The loop will execute repeatedly as long as inputs for `n`, `m`, and `s` are provided and not equal to 0. Each execution results in `n` being between 1 and 7, `m` being between 1 and 2000, `s` being between 1 and 3000, and the output will be `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`. When `n`, `m`, and `s` are all zero, the loop terminates. If any of the inputs are outside the specified ranges, the behavior is not well-defined and may lead to unexpected results. If the loop doesn't start (e.g., if all inputs are initially zero), the variables remain unchanged: `n`, `m`, `s` retain their initial values.**
