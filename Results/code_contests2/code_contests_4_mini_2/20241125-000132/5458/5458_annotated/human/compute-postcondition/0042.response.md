According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `s`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Since `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, the loop can execute as long as `s` is at least 1. 

Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `k` is set to its initial value for the first iteration, which is 1. Additionally, the other variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j` do not affect the execution of the loop itself but are part of the state.

To summarize, for the loop to execute, `k` should be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop, and `s` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1**
