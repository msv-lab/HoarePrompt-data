Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3] to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to 3. The variable `s` is greater than or equal to 3, ensuring that the conditions under which `dp` is modified are satisfied. If `j` is less than `k` (which is 3), then `dp` remains unchanged.***
