Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not modify `dp` and proceeds accordingly.***
