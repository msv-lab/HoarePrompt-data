The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is updated as described; `m` is incremented by 1, `s` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is `m + 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
