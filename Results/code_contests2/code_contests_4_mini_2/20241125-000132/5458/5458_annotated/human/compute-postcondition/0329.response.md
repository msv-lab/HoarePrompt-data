According to the code, the loop is dependent on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n ** 2` times, which means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to run a non-zero number of iterations. Since `n` is already specified to be between 1 and 7 (inclusive), this condition is satisfied. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` needs to be initialized. The loop's first iteration will set `i` to 0. 

Given that `n` is between 1 and 7, we can conclude that `n ** 2` will be between 1 and 49. Therefore, there will be a valid range of iterations for `i`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list of zeros, `i` is 0**
