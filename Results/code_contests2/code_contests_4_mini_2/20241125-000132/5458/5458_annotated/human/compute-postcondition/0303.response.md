The statement `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and `dp[1][m + 2][2]` remain unchanged. 

The output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop without altering any variable values.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
