Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, and `k` is less than `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated using the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
