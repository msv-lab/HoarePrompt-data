Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and it is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
