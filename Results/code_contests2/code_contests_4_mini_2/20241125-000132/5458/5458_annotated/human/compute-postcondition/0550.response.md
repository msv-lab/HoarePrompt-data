Postcondition: ***`i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. There is no change to the variables if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
