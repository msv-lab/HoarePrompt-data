According to the code, the loop is designed to execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `k` is currently equal to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted to be within the specified range, which means it needs to be set to `s`. Additionally, since `i` is equal to 0, the state of `i` can remain unchanged.

The only necessary adjustment is for `k`, which should be set to `s` to allow for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, and `k` is equal to `s`**
