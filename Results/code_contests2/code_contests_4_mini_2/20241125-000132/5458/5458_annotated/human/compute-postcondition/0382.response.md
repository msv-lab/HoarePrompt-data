The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it affects the flow of the program by skipping the rest of the current iteration of a loop. Since there is no additional context provided regarding any loop, we can only conclude that the process continues to the next iteration without modifying the existing variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged with respect to the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `dp`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2]`.**
