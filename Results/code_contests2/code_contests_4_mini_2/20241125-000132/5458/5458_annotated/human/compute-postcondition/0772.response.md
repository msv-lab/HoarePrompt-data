To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the loop structure and the conditions provided.

The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The important variables affecting the loop execution are `s` and `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `s` is between 1 and 3000 (this means the loop can potentially run multiple times).
- `k` has been set to a value within the range of 1 to `s` during the previous iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than `s`. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `s`, if `k` is currently equal to `s`, it will not allow another iteration as the next value of `k` would be `s + 1`, which is outside the loop's defined range.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we can conclude:
- `k` needs to be adjusted to `k` is less than `s` (specifically, `k` should be equal to `s` in the previous iteration for this to be necessary).
- `s` remains unchanged as it is still within its defined range.

Therefore, the adjustments to the states should be:

State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, `k` is less than `s`**.
