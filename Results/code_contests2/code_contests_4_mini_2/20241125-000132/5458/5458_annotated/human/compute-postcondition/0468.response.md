Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `k` is between 1 and `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to the `dp` array. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The loop will not execute if `s` is less than 1, in which case `k` remains 1, and the `dp` list remains unchanged.**
