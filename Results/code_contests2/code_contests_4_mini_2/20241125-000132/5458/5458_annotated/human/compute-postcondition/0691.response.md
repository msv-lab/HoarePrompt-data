The code assigns the value `1` to the multidimensional array `dp` at the position specified by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. Given that `i` is `0`, this evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`. Thus, the first index of `dp` will be `1`, the second index will be `j + 1`, and the third index will remain `k`, which is `1`. The states of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value `1`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value `1`.**
