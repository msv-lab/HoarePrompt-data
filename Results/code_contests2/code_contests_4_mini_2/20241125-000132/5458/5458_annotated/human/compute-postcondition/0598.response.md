The statement modifies the value of a specific entry in a multidimensional array `dp`. The assignment assigns the value `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

- `i` is less than `n`, meaning `i + 1` is at least `1`.
- The bitwise operation `i + 1 & 1` will yield either `0` or `1` depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd.
- `j` is `2`, so `j + 1` is `3`.
- `k` is `3`.

The other variables (`m` and `s`) do not affect this assignment. 

Since we don't have the specific values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `s`, we only note the conditions given for them. The output state reflects that the value of `dp` changes, but we cannot specify the exact changes to `dp` without knowing its prior contents. 

Thus, the output state summarizes the variable conditions and the assignment made.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
