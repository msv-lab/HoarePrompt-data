According to the code, the for loop iterates over the variable `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The loop will execute again if `k` can take on the next value in this range.

At the end of the last iteration, we have `k` less than `s`, which means `k` could be incremented to continue the loop. Given that `k` is currently less than `s`, the next value of `k` will be `k + 1`. Since `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, we can conclude that the state must be adjusted to reflect this increment.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified to show that `k` has been incremented by 1 to `k + 1`, while all other states remain unchanged.

State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, and `k` is equal to `k + 1` (where `k` was less than `s`)**
