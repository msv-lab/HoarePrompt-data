Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m + 1` and greater than 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the next iteration of the loop is executed. There is no else part in the code to handle cases when `j` is not greater than `k`.***
