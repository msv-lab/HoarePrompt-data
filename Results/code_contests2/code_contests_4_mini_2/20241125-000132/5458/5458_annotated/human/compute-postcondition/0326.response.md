The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 7 (inclusive), `m` is an input integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), `s` is an input integer between 1 and 3000 (inclusive), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
