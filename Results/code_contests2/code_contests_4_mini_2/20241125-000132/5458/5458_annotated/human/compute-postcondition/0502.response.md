Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2. The loop will execute `s` times, iterating over `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on both `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. If `s` is less than 1, or `j` is less than 2, the loop will not execute, and the values of `dp` will remain unchanged.**
