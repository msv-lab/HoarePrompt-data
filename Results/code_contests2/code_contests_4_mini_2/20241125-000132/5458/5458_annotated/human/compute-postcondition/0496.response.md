The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values. The variables retain their previous states, and we note that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is equal to 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
