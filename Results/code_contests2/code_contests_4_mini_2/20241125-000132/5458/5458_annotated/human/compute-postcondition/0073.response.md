According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` starting from 1 up to `s` (inclusive). The current state indicates that `k` is currently 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4. 

Additionally, `s` is a positive integer between 2 and 3000. Since `k` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 4 (which it is, since `s` is between 2 and 3000).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `k` needs to be incremented to 4.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`) do not need to be modified as they remain unchanged regardless of the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 2 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 4**
