According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to run again, `s` must be at least 2, and `k` must be updated to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`i` is 0, `s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 3**
