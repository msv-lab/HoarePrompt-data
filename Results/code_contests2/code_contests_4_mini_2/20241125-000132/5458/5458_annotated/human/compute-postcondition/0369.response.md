Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain as `0`, `2`, and `1` respectively. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`.***
