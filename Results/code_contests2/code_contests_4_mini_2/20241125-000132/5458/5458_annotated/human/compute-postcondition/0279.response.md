Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, and `k` is equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k` (which is equal to `s`), the program does not modify `dp` and continues with the next iteration.***
