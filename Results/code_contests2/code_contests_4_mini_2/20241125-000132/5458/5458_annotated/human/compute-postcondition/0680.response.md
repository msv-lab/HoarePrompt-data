The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop continues without modifying any variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is between 2 and `s`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
