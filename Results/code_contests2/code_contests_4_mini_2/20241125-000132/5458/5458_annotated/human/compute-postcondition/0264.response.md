Postcondition: ***If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and also considers the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. There is a potential issue if `k - j` is negative, which could lead to accessing out-of-bounds indices. Overall, the conditions of `s`, `j`, `k`, and `i` are preserved while updating the values in the dp array.***
