Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 and less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. There are no changes made to `dp` if `j` is not greater than `k`, as there is no else part provided.***
