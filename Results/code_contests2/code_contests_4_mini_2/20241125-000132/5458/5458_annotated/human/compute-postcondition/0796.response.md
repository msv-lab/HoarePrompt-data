The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the `dp` array at the indices calculated by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to `1`.
- `j` is `m + 1`, which is at least `3` (since `m` is at least `2`). Thus, `j + 1` is at least `4`.
- `k` is `1`.

The assignment effectively sets `dp[1][j + 1][1]` to `1`. The values of `s`, `m`, `n`, and other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state after executing this code line is:
- `s` is between 1 and 3000
- `m` is at least 2
- `n` is between 1 and 7
- `i` is 0
- `j` is at least 3 (which is `m + 1`)
- `k` is 1
- `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1**
