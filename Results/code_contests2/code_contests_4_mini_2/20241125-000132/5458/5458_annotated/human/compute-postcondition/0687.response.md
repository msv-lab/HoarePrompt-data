According to the loop structure, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `m`, which dictates the range through which `j` iterates. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is between 1 and 3000.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:

1. The loop variable `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `m`. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`.
2. Since `j` is incremented in each iteration, if the last value of `j` was `m`, it needs to be adjusted to `m + 1` for the loop to execute again.

Since `m` is at least 1, if `j` was equal to `m` at the end of the last iteration, `j` must now be `m + 1`, which means that `j` will exceed `m` in the next iteration, causing the loop to stop executing.

No other variables, such as `n`, `s`, or the `dp` array, need to be adjusted because they don't directly dictate the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is `m + 1`**
