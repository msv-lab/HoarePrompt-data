The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 

We know that:
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being modified, but we don't have the specific values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` or `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` from the initial state.
- We are aware that `k` is less than `s`, so the operation `k - j` is valid as long as `j` does not exceed `k`.

Since we do not have the specific values of the `dp` array or the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, we can only indicate that the update occurs.

The output state indicates that the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now modified based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, `k` is less than `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, `k` is less than `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
