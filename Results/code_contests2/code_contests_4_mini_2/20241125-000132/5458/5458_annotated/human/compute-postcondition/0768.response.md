Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is at least 1 and less than 48, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes to the variables occur in this fragment and the program will proceed to the next part of the loop.***
