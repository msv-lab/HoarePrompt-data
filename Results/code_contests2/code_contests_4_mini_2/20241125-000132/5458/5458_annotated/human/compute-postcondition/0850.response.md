The code assigns the value `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to index into the `dp` array. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but we know the following:

- `i` is either `0` or greater than `0`, resulting in `i + 1` being either `1` or greater.
- `j` is at least `3` and less than or equal to `m`, making `j + 1` at least `4` and at most `m + 1`.
- `k` is `3`.

Since the operation involves indexing an array, the state of the `dp` array will change, but the values of `s`, `m`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 and less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
