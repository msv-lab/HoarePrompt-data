The code updates a specific position in a multidimensional array `dp`. The index `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to `1` when `i` is `0`, as `1 & 1` is `1`. The values of `j` and `k` are `2` and `1`, respectively. Therefore, the statement sets `dp[1][3][1]` to `1`. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1**
