To determine the necessary adjustments to the state at the start of the for loop, we need to analyze the for loop structure and the current state provided.

1. **Analyzing the loop parameters**: The loop iterates over `k` in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. This means for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.

2. **Current state analysis**: 
   - `n` is between 1 and 7 (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `m` is between 1 and 2000 (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `s` is between 1 and 3000 (this is relevant as it defines the upper limit of `k`).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `k` is currently 2.

3. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop starts with `k` at 1 and will continue while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since the current value of `k` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to increment to 3.
   - The value of `s` must be at least 3 to allow for the next iteration where `k` would be 3.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the adjustments needed are:
- `k` should be incremented to 3.
- `s` should be adjusted to be at least 3.

Therefore, the adjusted state is as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 3 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3.**
