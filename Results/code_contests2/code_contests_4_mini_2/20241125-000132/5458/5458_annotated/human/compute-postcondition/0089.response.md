To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop condition.

1. The loop iterates over `k` in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `k` must still be less than or equal to `s`. 

2. According to the state provided:
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `m` is increased by at least 1.
   - `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` remains unchanged and is equal to 0.

3. The loop variable `k` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it exceeds `s`. Given that `s` is greater than or equal to 1, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

4. Since `m` is increased by at least 1, we don't need to adjust `m` for the loop condition.

5. The current condition for `k` is that it must be less than or equal to `s`. If `s` is equal to 1, then the loop has already executed its last iteration. For the loop to execute again, `s` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` remains unchanged and is equal to 0**
