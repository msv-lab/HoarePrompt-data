The `continue` statement is executed, which means that the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the program proceeds to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and the execution of the loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and the execution of the loop continues to the next iteration.**
