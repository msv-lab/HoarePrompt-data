The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

The variables `s`, `m`, `n`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. The variable `k` is defined as `k + 1` where `k` was less than `s`, which implies that `k` has a specific value that is already greater than its previous value but does not change the operation here.

Since the operation is merely copying a value from one position in a 3D array (or list) to another, it doesn't alter the state of the variables `s`, `m`, `n`, or `k`. 

Thus, the output state reflects that the variables have retained their previous values and that the assignment in the array has been executed.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, and `k` is equal to `k + 1` (where `k` was less than `s`)**
