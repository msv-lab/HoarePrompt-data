Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 3 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[1][2][3]` is updated to be equal to `dp[1][1][3]`, and the next iteration of the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp` or other variables, and the loop proceeds normally.***
