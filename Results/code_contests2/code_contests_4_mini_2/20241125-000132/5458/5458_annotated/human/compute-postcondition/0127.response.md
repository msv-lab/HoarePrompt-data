The statement assigns the value `1` to the `dp` array at the index specified by the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `s` is greater than or equal to 2
- `i` is 0
- `j` is greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is 2

The index `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. Therefore, the first index is `1`. The second index `j + 1` is greater than or equal to `2`. The third index remains `k`, which is `2`. 

Thus, the assignment modifies `dp[1][j + 1][2]` to be `1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged after this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1**
