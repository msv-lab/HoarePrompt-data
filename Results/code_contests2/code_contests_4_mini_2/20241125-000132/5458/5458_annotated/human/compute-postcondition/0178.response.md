According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The variable `k` is the loop variable that will take on values from 1 to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 2, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to take the next value in the range, which means `k` should be at least 3. Since the loop starts with `k = 1`, for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `k` can be incremented from its current value.

Therefore, the variable `k` must be adjusted to at least 3 to allow for the loop to execute again. The state of `s` does not need to change since it is already at least 2, which allows for `k` to have at least the value of 3.

State: **`dp` remains unchanged, `s` is at least 2, `k` is at least 3**
