Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is equal to or greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is set to 1 for each `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is at least 1 and less than 48, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` for each valid `k`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on previous dp states. If `s` is less than 1 or `i` is greater than or equal to 48, the loop will not execute; in that case, `dp` remains unchanged, and all other variables retain their initial values.**
