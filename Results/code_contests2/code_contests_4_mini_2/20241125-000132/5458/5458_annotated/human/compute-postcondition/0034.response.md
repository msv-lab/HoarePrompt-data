The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 3 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][2][3] = dp[1][1][3] and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
