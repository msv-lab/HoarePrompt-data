The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the values of `dp`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, as `continue` does not alter any variables directly. Instead, it affects the flow of execution within a loop. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration without changing any variable values.

Output State: **`dp` remains unchanged, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
