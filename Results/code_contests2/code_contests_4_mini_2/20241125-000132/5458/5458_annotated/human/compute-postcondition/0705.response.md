The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, and there is no impact on the program's state other than moving to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
