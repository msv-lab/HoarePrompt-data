To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided conditions and the loop structure.

1. The loop is dependent on `i`, which iterates from `0` to `n ** 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. 

2. At the end of the previous iteration, we are not given the specific value of `i`, but we know that it must be less than `n ** 2` for the loop to execute again. If `i` is currently at its maximum value (which is `n ** 2 - 1`), then it cannot execute again.

3. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect that it would be `n ** 2 - 1` at the end of the last iteration to allow for the next loop iteration with the next value of `i`.

4. Since there are no other variables that affect the execution of this loop or need adjustment, we focus solely on the value of `i`.

Thus, the adjustments to the state are as follows:

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is at most `n ** 2 - 1`**
