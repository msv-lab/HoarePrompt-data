According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at its maximum value of `m`, which means the loop cannot execute again unless `m` is increased. 

Since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `m + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be increased by at least one. Additionally, `j` will then be `m + 1` in the next iteration, as it will take the value of `j` from the previous iteration incremented by 1.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `m` must be increased by at least 1 to allow for one more iteration.
- `j` must be set to `m + 1`, which will be the new value for `j`.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by at least 1, `s` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`**
