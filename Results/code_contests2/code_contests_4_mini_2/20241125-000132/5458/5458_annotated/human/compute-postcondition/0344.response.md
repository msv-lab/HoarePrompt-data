In the given for loop, the execution depends on the variable `k`, which is iterating from 1 to `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1
- `k` is 1
- `s` is between 1 and 3000

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented from its current value of 1. The next value of `k` will be 2. Since `s` is between 1 and 3000, it is guaranteed that `k` can be incremented to 2 without exceeding the upper limit of `s`.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to update `k` to 2.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list of zeros, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2.**
