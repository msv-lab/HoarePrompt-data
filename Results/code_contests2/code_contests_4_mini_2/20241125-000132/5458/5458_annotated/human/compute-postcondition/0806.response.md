According to the code, the loop executes for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is between 1 and 3000. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will need to be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 2. The value of `s` does not need to change since it is already between 1 and 3000, thus allowing for further iterations.

State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 if `i` equals 0, and `j` is equal to `m + 1` and greater than 1 if `i` is greater than 0, `k` is 2**
