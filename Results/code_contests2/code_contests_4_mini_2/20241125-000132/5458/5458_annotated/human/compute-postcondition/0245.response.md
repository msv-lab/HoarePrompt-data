Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program proceeds to the next iteration without making any changes.***
