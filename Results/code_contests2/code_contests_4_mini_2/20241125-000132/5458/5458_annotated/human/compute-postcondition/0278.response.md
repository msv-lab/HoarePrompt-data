The statement `continue` causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables are not changed by this statement, but it indicates that we are proceeding to the next loop iteration without executing any of the subsequent code in the current iteration. Therefore, the output state remains reflective of the current values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and the assignment related to `dp`. 

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `k` is equal to `s`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
