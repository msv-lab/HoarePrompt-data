The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. The values of the affected variables do not change with this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding the previously assigned values.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
