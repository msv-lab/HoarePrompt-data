According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k`. The loop iterates over a range from 1 to `s + 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be equal to `s` for the current iteration to be the last one. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted to `s + 1`, which is the next value in the range.

State: **`i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][s - j]`, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`**
