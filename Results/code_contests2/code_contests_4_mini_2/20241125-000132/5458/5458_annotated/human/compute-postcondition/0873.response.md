Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is 7, `i` is 48, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration, leaving the values of `dp` unchanged for other indices. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the loop also proceeds to the next iteration.***
