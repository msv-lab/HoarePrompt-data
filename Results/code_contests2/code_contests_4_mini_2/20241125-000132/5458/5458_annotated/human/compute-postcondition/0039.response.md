To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop statement.

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `n` is between 1 and 7 (inclusive).
   - `m` is between 1 and 2000 (positive integer).
   - `s` is between 3 and 3000 (positive integer).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `k` is 3.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```
   for k in xrange(1, s + 1):
   ```
   - The loop will iterate as long as `k` is between 1 and `s` (inclusive). Since `s` is at least 3, the loop can execute multiple times depending on the value of `s`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 3. 
   - The next value of `k` will be 4 in the next iteration.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Thus, `s` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue, since `k` will be incremented to 4.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `k` is currently 3 and will be incremented to 4, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time.
   - Since `s` is currently between 3 and 3000, we can specify that `s` must be at least 4.

6. **Final State**:
   - Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration must reflect:
     - `n` remains unchanged (between 1 and 7).
     - `m` remains unchanged (between 1 and 2000).
     - `s` must be adjusted to be at least 4 (so `s` is greater than or equal to 4).
     - `i`, `j`, and `k` can remain unchanged for this adjustment.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 4**
