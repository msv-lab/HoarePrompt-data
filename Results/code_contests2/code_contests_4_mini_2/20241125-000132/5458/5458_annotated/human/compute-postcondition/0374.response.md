Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. There are no changes to `dp` or any other variables if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
