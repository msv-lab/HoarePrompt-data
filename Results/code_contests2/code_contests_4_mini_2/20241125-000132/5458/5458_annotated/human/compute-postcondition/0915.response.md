The code contains a `continue` statement, which causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `s`, `m`, `n`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of these variables along with the indication that the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is 7, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
