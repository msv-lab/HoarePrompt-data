Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is 7, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the array `dp` is updated such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the loop will also continue to the next iteration, maintaining the initial conditions.***
