To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the current values of the variables involved in the loop condition.

1. The loop iterates over `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.
2. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `m + 1`. We also know that `s` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, which implies that `k` (which is `m + 1`) is currently less than or equal to `s`. 
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `m + 2`. Thus, `k` should be adjusted to reflect this increment.
4. We also need to ensure that `s` remains greater than or equal to the new value of `k` (which will be `m + 2`).

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` should be set to `m + 2`, and 
- We must ensure that `s` is still greater than or equal to `m + 2`.

Thus, the adjusted state will be:

State: **`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. `k` is equal to `m + 2`, and `s` is greater than or equal to `m + 2`.**
