According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is between 1 and 3000. Since the loop is iterating over `k` from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be updated to the next value, which is `k + 1`.

Since we do not have the current value of `k`, we can only ensure that `k` remains within the bounds defined by `s`. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `s`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `k` is less than `s`.**
