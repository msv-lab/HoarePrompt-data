The statement updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The initial state indicates that `j` is equal to `m + 1` and greater than 1, and since `j` is greater than `k`, the update will be executed. The other variables (`s`, `m`, `n`, `i`, and `k`) are not directly impacted by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation, while the other values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m + 1` and greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
