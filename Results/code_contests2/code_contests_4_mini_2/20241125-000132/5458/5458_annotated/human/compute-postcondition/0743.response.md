Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is initialized to 1 and `k` is equal to 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and it is also incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The state of `dp` will reflect these updates based on the conditions met.***
