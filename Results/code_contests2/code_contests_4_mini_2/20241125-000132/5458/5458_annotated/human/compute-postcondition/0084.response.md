The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next iteration if one exists. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects that no changes were made but indicates that the loop continues.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m + 1` and is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0, and the loop continues**.
