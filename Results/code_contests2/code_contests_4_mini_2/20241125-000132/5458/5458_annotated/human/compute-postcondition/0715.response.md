Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to match `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. There is no change to the state when `j` is less than or equal to `k`, as there is no else part to handle that case.***
