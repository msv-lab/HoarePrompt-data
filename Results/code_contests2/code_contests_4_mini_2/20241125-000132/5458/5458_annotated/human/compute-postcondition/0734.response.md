Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to 1, and `k` is equal to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to the `dp` array. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp` remains unchanged regardless of the values of `j` and `k`.***
