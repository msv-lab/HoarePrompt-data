The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, and the loop continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same, but we note that we continue to the next loop iteration.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `j` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next loop iteration.**
