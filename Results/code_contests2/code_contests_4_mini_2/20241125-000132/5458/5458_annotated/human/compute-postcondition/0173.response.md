The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` remains unchanged, `s` is at least 2, `k` is at least 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` remains unchanged, `s` is at least 2, `k` is at least 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
