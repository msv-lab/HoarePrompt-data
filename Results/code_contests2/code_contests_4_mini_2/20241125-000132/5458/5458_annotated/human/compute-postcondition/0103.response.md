Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` remains unchanged and is equal to 0, `k` is now 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution continues out of the most internal loop or if statement, while if `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in the program state.***
