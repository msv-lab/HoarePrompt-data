Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, and `k` is equal to `k + 1` (where `k` was less than `s`). If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the state, and the program proceeds without entering this if statement.***
