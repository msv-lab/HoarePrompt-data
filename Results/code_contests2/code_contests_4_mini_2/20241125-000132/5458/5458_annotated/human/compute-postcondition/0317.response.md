According to the code, the loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3. Since `s` is at least 2, the current state allows for `k` to be incremented to 4 in the next iteration, assuming `s` is at least 4. Therefore, `s` must be adjusted to be at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i` is 0, `s` is at least 4, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 4**
