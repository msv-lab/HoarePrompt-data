Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All values are maintained under modulo constraints.***
