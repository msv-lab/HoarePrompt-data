According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1; since `s` is between 1 and 3000, this condition is satisfied. The loop variable `k` will start at 1 when the loop begins. The variable `j`, which is greater than or equal to 2, is not relevant to the execution of this loop.

Therefore, the adjusted states are: `n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is now 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2**
