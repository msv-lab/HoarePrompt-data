The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there are no changes to the values of any variables and the context of the loop is not provided, the values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
