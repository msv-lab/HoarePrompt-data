Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 and less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than 1, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. There is no change to the `dp` array if `j` is less than or equal to 1.***
