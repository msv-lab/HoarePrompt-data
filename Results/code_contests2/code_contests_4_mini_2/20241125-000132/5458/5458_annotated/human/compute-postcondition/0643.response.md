Output State: **If `i` is less than `n` and `m` is at least 1 and `s` is at least 1, then `dp` is updated according to the nested loop logic for values of `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for applicable iterations. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The loop will not execute if `s` is less than 1 or if `i` is not less than `n`, meaning `i` must be less than `n` and `s` must be at least 1 for any operation to take place. In cases where `s` is 0 or less, or if `i` is not less than `n`, the values of `dp` remain unchanged, and `j` and `k` will not progress through their ranges.**
