The statement updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The variable `j` is evaluated to check if it is less than or equal to `k`, and no changes are made if this condition is true. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not specified in the initial state, but the operation implies an update to `dp`.

Since `j` is either less than or equal to `k`, the addition does not take place, and the previous state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged based on the condition of `j`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged based on the condition of `j`**
