The value of `j` is initialized to 1, which is less than or equal to `k`, which is 3. Since the program does not execute the if block, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. The code involving `dp` does not execute, and thus does not affect the state of any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 3, and the values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 3, and the values remain unchanged.**
