The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables directly but instead skips the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next iteration. Since the values of `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, the output state reflects their unchanged conditions along with the fact that we are skipping to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
