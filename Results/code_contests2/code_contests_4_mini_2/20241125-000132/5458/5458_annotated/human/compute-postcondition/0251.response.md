According to the code, the loop will execute for `j` in the range from 1 to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be `m` for the loop to execute again, which means at the start of the next iteration, `j` must be incremented to `m + 1`. 

Since the loop is structured to iterate up to `m`, if `j` is currently `m`, the next `j` will be `m + 1`, which would cause the loop to terminate and not execute again.

Hence, the only adjustment needed is to set `j` to `m + 1`.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`**
