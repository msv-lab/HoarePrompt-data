Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` is updated based on the values of `dp` from previous states with the increment applied if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, specifically by adding `dp[i & 1][2][k - 2] % mod` to it, ensuring all operations respect the modulo constraint.***
