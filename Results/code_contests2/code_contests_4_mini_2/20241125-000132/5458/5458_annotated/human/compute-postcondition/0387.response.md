According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, and `s` is between 1 and 3000. Since `k` is currently at the maximum value of `s`, to allow the loop to execute again, we need to adjust `s` to be greater than or equal to the current value of `k`.

Assuming that the loop has just executed with `k` equal to `s`, we must increment `k` to `s + 1`. Thus, we need to ensure that `s` is at least `s + 1`, leading to the conclusion that `s` must be adjusted to at least `s + 1` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`**
