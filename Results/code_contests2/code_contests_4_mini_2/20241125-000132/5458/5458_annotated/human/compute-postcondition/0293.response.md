The statement updates a multidimensional array `dp` at the indices specified. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The current values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are utilized, but since they are not specified, we only note their conditions. 

The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` do not change as a result of this operation, but we note that the assignment occurs based on their current state.

The output state reflects the unchanged variables and the assignment operation:

Output State: **`i` is not equal to 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
