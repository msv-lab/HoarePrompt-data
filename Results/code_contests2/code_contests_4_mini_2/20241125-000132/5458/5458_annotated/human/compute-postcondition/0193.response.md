Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j` (where `j` is equal to `m`), `k` (which is equal to 1), and `s` (which is greater than or equal to 1). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][1]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][1] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][0] % mod` where `k - j` is valid. Overall, the updates to `dp` account for various conditions of `i` and `j` while ensuring that the modular arithmetic is maintained.***
