Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is equal to 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute any updates or continue, and the state remains unchanged.***
