According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates `n ** 2` times, and since `n` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 7 (inclusive), `n ** 2` will always be a positive integer between 1 and 49 (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will execute at least once.

The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. The states `m` and `s` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, but they are positive integers as given.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0**
