According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, which is already ensured by the initial state. The loop variable `k` starts at 1 and will increment by 1 until it reaches `s + 1`, so it will iterate from 1 to `s`.

Since `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `k` will start at 1, and the initial value of `j` is not directly relevant to the execution of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the state can be maintained as is, but we can specify the starting value of `k`.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1**
