Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` remains unchanged. Additionally, if the else part is executed and `j` is greater than `k`, the function will copy `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` into `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the current values of `dp` while ensuring that the expression `k - j` does not lead to negative indexing. Overall, the modifications depend on the values of `j` relative to `k`, ensuring appropriate handling of cases where `j` is equal to or less than `k`.***
