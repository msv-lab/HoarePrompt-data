Postcondition: ***`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. Additionally, `k` is equal to `k + 1` where `k` was less than `s`.***
