The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged aside from this control flow.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is between 1 and 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is at least 3 and less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 2, and the loop will continue to the next iteration.**
