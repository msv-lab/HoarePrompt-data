The statement `continue` causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, and we are still within the loop context. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
