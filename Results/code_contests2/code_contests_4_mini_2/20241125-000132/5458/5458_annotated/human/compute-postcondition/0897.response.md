According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be adjusted to allow for the next value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 1, and `j` is at least 1. The loop currently iterates over `j` from 1 to `m + 1`, which means if `j` is at its maximum value (`m`), the next iteration would require `j` to be incremented to `m + 1`. 

Since `j` can only take values from 1 to `m`, to execute one more time, `m` must be incremented by 1 (making it at least 2) so that the loop can iterate with `j` now being 2 or higher.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `m` needs to be at least 2 for the loop to execute once more.

Other states (`s`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged as they do not impact the ability of the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is 7**
