The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are `s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is 7, and `k` is 1. The state of the `dp` array is modified, but specific values for `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and `mod` are not provided, so we cannot determine exact numerical values. Therefore, the output state describes the changes in the `dp` array without specific values.

Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 2, `n` is 7, `k` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
