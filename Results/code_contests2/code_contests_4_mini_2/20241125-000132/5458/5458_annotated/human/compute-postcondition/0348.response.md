The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the current loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` has been updated at dp[1][2][2] = dp[1][1][2], `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.**
