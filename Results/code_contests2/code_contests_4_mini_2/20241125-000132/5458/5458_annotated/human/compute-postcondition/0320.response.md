Output State: **If `m` is at least 1 and `s` is at least 1, then the loop will execute `m` times, with `j` ranging from 1 to `m` and `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. The values of `dp` will be updated conditionally based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Specifically, if `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j < k`, `dp` remains unchanged in that specific iteration. If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j <= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If either `m` is 0 or negative, or if `s` is 0 or negative, or if `j` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and the `dp` array remains unchanged.**
