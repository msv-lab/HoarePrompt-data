According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `s`. The loop runs from `k = 1` to `k = s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Given that `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `k` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 4 (since `k` will increment to 4). 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `s` is at least 4. The value of `k` will also change to 4 at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 4 and 3000, `j` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 0 or 1, and `k` is 4**
