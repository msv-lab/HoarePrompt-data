According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`. Since the loop iterates from `1` to `m + 1`, if `j` is currently `m`, it means the loop has executed for all values up to `m`, and `j` would be `m + 1` at the start of the next iteration, which would not allow the loop to execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` would need to be adjusted to `m` to allow for another iteration. 

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `m` is at least `1` to ensure the loop can execute again and increment `j`.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `m`, `m` is at least 1**
