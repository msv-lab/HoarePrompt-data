The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and the requirement that `j` is greater than 1, and we continue to the next iteration.
