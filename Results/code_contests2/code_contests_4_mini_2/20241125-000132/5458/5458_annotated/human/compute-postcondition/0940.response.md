The statement `continue` does not modify any variables but instead instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Given the initial state, we can conclude that the values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`dp` is updated based on the conditions pertaining to `i`, `j`, and `k`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than 1; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
