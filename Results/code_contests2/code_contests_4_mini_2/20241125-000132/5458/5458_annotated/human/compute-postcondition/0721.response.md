According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently equal to `m + 1`, which means the loop has completed its iterations and will not execute again unless `m` is increased.

Since `m` is greater than or equal to 1, it is possible that `m` is currently 1, causing `j` to be equal to 2 at the end of the previous iteration. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be adjusted to allow `j` to be equal to 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `m` should be adjusted to be at least 1, but since `j` is currently `m + 1`, it must be adjusted to 1 less than its current value to allow `j` to be 1.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to 1**
