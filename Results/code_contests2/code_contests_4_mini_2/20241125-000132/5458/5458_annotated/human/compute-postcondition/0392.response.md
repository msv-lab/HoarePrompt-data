Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the execution of the program proceeds to the next logic outside this if statement.***
