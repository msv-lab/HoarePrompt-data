According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1, which it is according to the given state (`s` is between 1 and 3000). 

Before the loop starts, the variable `k` is not explicitly set, but it will start from 1 during the first iteration of the loop. The variables `i` and `j` do not affect the execution of this specific loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the current states are sufficient, and we need to ensure that `k` is initialized to 1 at the beginning of the loop. 

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions [2][m + 2][s + 1], `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
