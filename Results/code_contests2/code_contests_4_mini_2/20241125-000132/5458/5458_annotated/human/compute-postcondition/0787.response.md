Output State: **`s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, `k` is equal to `k + 1`, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the state.**
