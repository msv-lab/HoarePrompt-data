The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
