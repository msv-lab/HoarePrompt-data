Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `j` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there are no changes made to `dp`, and the program proceeds without entering the if block.***
