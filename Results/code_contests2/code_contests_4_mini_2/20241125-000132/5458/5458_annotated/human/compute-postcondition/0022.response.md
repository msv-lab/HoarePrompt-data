The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the state of a multi-dimensional list or array `dp`. Here, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2.

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` is calculated:
   - `i + 1` equals `1`.
   - `1 & 1` results in `1` (since both bits are 1).

2. The expression `j + 1` results in `2`.

3. The indices for the array `dp` now become `[1][2][2]`.

4. The element at `dp[1][2][2]` is set to `1`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][2]` is set to 1**.
