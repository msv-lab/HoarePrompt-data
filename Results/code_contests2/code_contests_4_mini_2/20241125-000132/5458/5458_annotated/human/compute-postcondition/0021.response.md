According to the code, the loop is set to iterate over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The current state at the end of the last iteration has the variable `k` at 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to the next value, which will be 2. 

We also need to ensure that `s` is such that `s + 1` is at least 2, confirming the loop can execute again. Since `s` is already stated to be a positive integer between 1 and 3000, this condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the adjustment to the state would be to increment `k` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2**
