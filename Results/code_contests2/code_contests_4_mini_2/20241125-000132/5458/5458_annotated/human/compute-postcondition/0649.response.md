The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the most internal scope we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 3000, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
