The code `continue` does not alter the values of any variables; it simply skips the current iteration of the loop. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` has been modified at index `[i + 1 & 1][3][1]` to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` has been modified at index `[i + 1 & 1][3][1]` to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
