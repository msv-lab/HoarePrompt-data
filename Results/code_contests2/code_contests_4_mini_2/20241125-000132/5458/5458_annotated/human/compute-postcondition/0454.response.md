Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `k` is between 2 and `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues in the nearest enclosing loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made, and the program proceeds as normal.***
