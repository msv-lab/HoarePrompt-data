The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. No variables are modified directly by this statement, but it indicates that the loop (in which this statement is executed) will move on to the next iteration without executing any further code within the loop for the current iteration. The values of the affected variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is not equal to 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is not equal to 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
