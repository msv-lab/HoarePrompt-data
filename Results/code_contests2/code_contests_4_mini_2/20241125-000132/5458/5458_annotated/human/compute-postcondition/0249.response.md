According to the code, the loop is governed by the variable `k`, which is iterating from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is currently 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `s` is at least 3, the condition for the loop (`k` must be less than or equal to `s`) is satisfied.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `k`. 

State: **`s` is at least 3, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3**
