Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is equal to 2, and `k` is equal to 2. If `j` (which is 1) is not greater than `k` (which is 2), the program continues to the next iteration without modifying the state of `dp`. If `j` were greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` would be set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program would also continue to the next iteration. Thus, there are no changes made to `dp` when `j` is less than or equal to `k`, and the control simply proceeds to the next loop iteration.***
