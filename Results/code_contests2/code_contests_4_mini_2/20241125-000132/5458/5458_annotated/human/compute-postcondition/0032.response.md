Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 3 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][3]` is set to 1. There are no changes to the state of the program if `j` is less than `k`.***
