According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `s + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must be at least `1`, which it is since it is specified to be between `1` and `3000`. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `k` will be initialized to `1` on the first iteration. The variables `n`, `m`, and `j` do not affect the execution of this loop, but they are present in the state. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute are:
- `s` is any value between `1` and `3000`, which ensures that `s + 1` is greater than `1`.
- `k` is initialized to `1`.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is at least 3, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1**
