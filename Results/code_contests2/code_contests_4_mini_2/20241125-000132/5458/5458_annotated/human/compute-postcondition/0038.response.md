Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 3 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` is modified based on the conditions of the else part: `dp[1][2][3]` is set to the value of `dp[1][1][3]` modulo `mod`, and then `dp[1][2][3]` is incremented by the value of `dp[0][1][2]` modulo `mod`. In either case, the values of `dp` change according to the conditions, maintaining the constraints of the integers involved.***
