The statement updates the 2D list `dp` at the specified indices. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1` because `i` is currently `0`, and adding `1` results in `1`. The indices for `j` and `k` are `j + 1` and `k`, respectively. Given that `j` is `1`, `j + 1` evaluates to `2`, and since `k` is `1`, the update targets `dp[1][2][1]`. 

The existing values of `dp` are not provided, but the code sets `dp[1][2][1]` to `1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged after this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list with `dp[1][2][1]` set to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2)x(s + 1) list with `dp[1][2][1]` set to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
