The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is between 1 and 3000, `m` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 7, and `k` is equal to `k + 1` (where `k` was less than `s`), and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
