According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `k` and its relationship to `s`. The loop iterates for `k` from 1 to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 2, which means `s` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time with `k` being incremented.

Since `k` should be incremented to 4 in the next iteration, and we need to ensure that `s` is at least 4 to allow this, we must adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`**
