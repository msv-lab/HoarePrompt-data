Postcondition: ***`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 2, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp` at `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][2][0] % mod`, accounting for potential edge cases where `k` could be less than `j`, ensuring all paths of execution are covered.***
