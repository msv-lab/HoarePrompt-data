According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `s + 1`. Given that `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute at least once. 

At the start of the loop, `k` will be initialized to 1 (the first value in the range). The variables `m` and `j` do not directly affect the execution of this loop, but their values are noted as part of the initial state. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to capture the initial values of `k`, which starts at 1.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1**
