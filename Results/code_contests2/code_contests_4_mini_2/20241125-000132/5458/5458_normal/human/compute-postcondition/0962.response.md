Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][m + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, the updates to `dp` are performed modulo `mod`.***
