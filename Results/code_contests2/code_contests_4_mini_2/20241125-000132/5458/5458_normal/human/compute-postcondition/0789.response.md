Postcondition: ***`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is updated based on the previous state of `dp` as `dp[1][j + 1][3] = dp[1][j][3] % mod` and also incorporates `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, the modifications to `dp` are contingent on the values of `j` in relation to `k`.***
