Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 2 and 2001, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration. In all cases, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes occur to the `dp` array in this block.***
