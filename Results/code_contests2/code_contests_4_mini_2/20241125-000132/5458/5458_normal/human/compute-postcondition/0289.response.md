The code assigns the value `1` to the element at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` of a multidimensional array `dp`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to `1`.
- `j` is at least `3`, so `j + 1` will be at least `4`.
- `k` is at least `1`.

Thus, the assignment affects only the `dp` array at the position `[1][j + 1][k]`, where `j + 1` is at least `4` and `k` is at least `1`. 

Other variables `s`, `n`, `m` remain unaffected, so the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
