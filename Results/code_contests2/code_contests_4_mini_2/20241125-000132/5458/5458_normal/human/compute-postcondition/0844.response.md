The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.  
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
