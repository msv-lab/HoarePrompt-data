Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, and `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][j][k]`. In the case where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures that the values in the `dp` array are correctly modified based on the conditions of `j` and `k`, while retaining the overall constraints of the input variables.***
