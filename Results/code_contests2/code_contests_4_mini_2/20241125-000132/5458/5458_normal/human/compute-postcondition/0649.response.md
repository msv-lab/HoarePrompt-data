The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `dp` do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `dp` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
