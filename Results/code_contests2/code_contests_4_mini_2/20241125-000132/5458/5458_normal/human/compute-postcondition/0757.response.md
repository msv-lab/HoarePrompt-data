According to the code, the loop will execute `n ** 2` times, where `n` is between 1 and 7. At the end of the last iteration, the maximum value for `i` can be `n ** 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n ** 2`. Since `n` is between 1 and 7, the maximum possible value for `n ** 2` is 49 (when `n` is 7). 

If the loop has executed `n ** 2` times, `i` would be equal to `n ** 2 - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` must be adjusted to ensure that `n ** 2` is greater than the current value of `i + 1`. 

Given that `i` is currently at its maximum possible value (`n ** 2 - 1`), `n` must be adjusted to ensure that `i` is less than `n ** 2`. To allow for one more iteration, `n` should be adjusted to be at least 4 (since 4 ** 2 = 16, which allows `i` to be 15). 

Thus, while `n` can be between 1 and 7, we specifically need to ensure that `n` is adjusted to 4 or more for the loop to execute another time.

State: **`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a modified 2D list based on the conditions applied during the loop execution, `i` is `n ** 2 - 1`**
