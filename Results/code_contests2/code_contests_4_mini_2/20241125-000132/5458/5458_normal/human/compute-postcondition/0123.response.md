Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is greater than 1, and `k` is 1; since `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration in the most immediate loop.**
