The line of code provided is manipulating a data structure `dp`, which is not defined in the initial state. We cannot determine the specific values of `dp` since `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, and we don't know how `dp` is structured or initialized. However, we can analyze the code as follows:

The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This indicates that the current value at the position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be replaced with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` do not change, we can only report that the value of `dp` at those indices has been updated, but we cannot specify the new values without knowing the content of `dp`.

Thus, we can summarize the impact on the variables based on the information given:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 2 and 2001, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 2, and the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**.
