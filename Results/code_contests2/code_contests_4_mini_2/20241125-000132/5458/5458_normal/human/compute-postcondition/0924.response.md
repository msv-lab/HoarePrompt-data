The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
