Postcondition: ***If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and additionally incorporates `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, `s` is at least 3, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is at least `m + 1`, and `k` is 3.***
