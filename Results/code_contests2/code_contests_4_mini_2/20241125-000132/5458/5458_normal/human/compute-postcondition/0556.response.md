Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then either `dp[1][j + 1][2]` or `dp[0][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1, depending on the value of `i`. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` array.***
