According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1, meaning that the loop can execute again if `k` is incremented. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to 2. 

No other states need to be adjusted since the conditions for `s`, `j`, `m`, and `i` do not affect the loop's ability to execute again given that `s` is at least 1.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`**
