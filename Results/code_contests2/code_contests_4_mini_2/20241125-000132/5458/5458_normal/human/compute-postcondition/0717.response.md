The statement updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` do not affect this operation directly. However, we need to ensure that `k - j` is a valid index for the `dp` array. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we know that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

The output state indicates that the state of the `dp` array has changed, but without specific numbers or ranges for the indices, we can only describe the effect of the operation.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with modulus applied.**
