According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4, and `s` needs to be at least 4 to ensure that the condition of the loop (`k <= s`) holds true.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is 4**
