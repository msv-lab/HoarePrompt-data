Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is between 1 and `n-1` and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and also incorporates the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures that all potential cases concerning the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are covered.***
