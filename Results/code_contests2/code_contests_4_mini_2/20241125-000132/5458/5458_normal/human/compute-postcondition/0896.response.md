Output State: **`if s is at least 1 then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the conditions set in the loop for each k from 1 to s. After the loop executes s times, `k` will be equal to `s`, `j` remains 1, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp` may contain updated values based on the conditions. If `s` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, leaving `dp` unchanged, `j` as 1, `i` less than `n^2 - 1`, and `m` greater than or equal to 1.**
