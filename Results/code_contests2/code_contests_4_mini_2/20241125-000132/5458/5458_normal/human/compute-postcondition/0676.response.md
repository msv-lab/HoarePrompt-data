According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates from `1` to `s`, and at the end of the last iteration, `k` is `s + 1`, which is greater than `s`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `s`, which is between 1 and 7. Therefore, the states need to reflect that `k` is now equal to `s`. 

No other states need adjustment because `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j` are not directly affected by this loop's range and do not need to change.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `k` is equal to `s`, which is between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
