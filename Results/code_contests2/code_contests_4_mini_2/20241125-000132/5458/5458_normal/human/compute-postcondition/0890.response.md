The code contains a `continue` statement, which causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration without modifying any variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
