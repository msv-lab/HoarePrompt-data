The code contains a `continue` statement, which causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and continue with the next iteration. However, since there are no defined loops in the provided context, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `dp` do not change, and the code does not affect any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a two-dimensional list initialized with zeros of size (2, m + 2) and (s + 1) for each inner list.**
