The values of the variables do not change, but we continue the loop or the block of code we are currently in. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and we continue in the most internal loop or block of code.
