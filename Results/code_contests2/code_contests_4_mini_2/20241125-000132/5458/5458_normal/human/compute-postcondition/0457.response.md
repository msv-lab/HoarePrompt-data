Postcondition: ***If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is set to the value of `dp[1][1][2]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is updated by adding `dp[0][1][1] % mod` to it. In all cases, the variables `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` retain their original values of 7, 0, greater than or equal to 1, 1, greater than or equal to 2, and 2 respectively.***
