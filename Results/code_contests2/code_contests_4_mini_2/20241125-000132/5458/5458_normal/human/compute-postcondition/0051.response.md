Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is j + 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no assignment occurs, and the next iteration proceeds with the current state of `dp`. This ensures that the program handles all edge cases related to the value of `j` with respect to `k`.***
