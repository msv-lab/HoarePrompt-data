Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, which results in `dp[1][4][3] = 1` if `i` is 0 or `dp[0][4][3] = 1` if `i` is 1. There is no change to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`.***
