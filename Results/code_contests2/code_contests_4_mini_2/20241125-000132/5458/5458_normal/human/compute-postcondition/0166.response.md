Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and if `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur to the `dp` array, thus the program proceeds without modifying `dp`.**
