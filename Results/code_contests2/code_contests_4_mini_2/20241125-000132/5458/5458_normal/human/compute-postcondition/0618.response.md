Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the variables or the data structure, and the program also continues to the next iteration of the loop. This ensures that all subsequent operations are based on the unchanged state of the variables when `j` is less than or equal to `k`.***
