The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 2, `dp` is updated accordingly, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
