According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is 7. Therefore, `n ** 2` is 49. Since `i` is 0, it is currently less than 49, which means the loop can execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the next iteration. The value of `i` will increment by 1 with each loop iteration. 

No other states need to be changed since `n`, `m`, `j`, and `s` do not affect the continuation of the loop in this context.

State: **`n` is 7, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `s` is at least 1**
