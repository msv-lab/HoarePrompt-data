According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition of the outer loop, which is `n`. The loop executes `n^2` times, meaning `i` must be less than `n^2` for another iteration to occur. 

At the end of the last iteration, we do not have a specific value for `i`, but we know it must be less than `n^2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be equal to its current value plus one (i.e., `i + 1`), while still remaining less than `n^2`. 

Since there are no changes to `j`, `s`, or `dp` mentioned directly related to the for loop statement, those states remain unchanged.

State: **`i` is less than `n^2 - 1, j` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `dp` remains unchanged**
