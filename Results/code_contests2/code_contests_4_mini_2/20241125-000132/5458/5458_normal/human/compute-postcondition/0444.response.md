The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it causes the execution to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables. 

Output State: **`n` is 7, `i` is 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[0][j][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
