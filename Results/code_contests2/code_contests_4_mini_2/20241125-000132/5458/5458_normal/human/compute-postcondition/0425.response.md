The `continue` statement causes the execution to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables are not changed by this statement, and it does not return any value. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and indicates that the loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `j` is `m + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
