Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `n` is within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring the final value of `dp` reflects the necessary calculations based on the conditions applied.***
