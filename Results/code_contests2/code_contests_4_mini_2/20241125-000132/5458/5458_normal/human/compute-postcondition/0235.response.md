The statement `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since no loop context is provided, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][k]` is equal to `dp[1][1][k]`.
