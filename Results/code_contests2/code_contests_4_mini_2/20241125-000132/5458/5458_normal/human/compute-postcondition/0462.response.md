The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop and continue to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][2]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
