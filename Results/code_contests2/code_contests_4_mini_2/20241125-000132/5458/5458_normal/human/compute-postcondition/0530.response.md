The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 3, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is at least `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
