Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in the `dp` array or the control flow, and the current state remains unchanged.***
