Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to 3, an attempt is made to assign 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, noting that the values of `i` and `j` are undefined, leading to potential issues if not properly initialized. There is no else part in the code.***
