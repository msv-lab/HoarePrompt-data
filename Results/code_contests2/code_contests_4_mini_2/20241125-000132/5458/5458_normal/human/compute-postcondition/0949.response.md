The code contains a `continue` statement which affects the flow of control in a loop. The values of the variables do not change but we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, `i` can be either 0 or non-zero, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.
