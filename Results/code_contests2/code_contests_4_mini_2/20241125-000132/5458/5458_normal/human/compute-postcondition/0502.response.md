Output State: **If `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute `s` times where `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to `dp[1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, it will be computed as `dp[1][j + 1][k] = (dp[1][j][k] + dp[0][j][k - j]) % mod`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged.**
