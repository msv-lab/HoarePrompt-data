The code contains a `continue` statement, which causes the program to skip the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables themselves do not change, and the overall state remains the same. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
