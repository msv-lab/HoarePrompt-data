Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][4][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]`, and if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is updated by adding the value from `dp[i & 1][3][k - j]` mod `mod`, maintaining the influence of the boundary conditions on the `dp` updates.***
