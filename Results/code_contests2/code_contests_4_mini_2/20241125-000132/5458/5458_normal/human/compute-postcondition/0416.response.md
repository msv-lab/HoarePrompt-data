The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remainder of the current loop iteration and jump to the next iteration of the loop. Since the values of the variables do not change with the execution of this statement and we are not provided with information about the loop structure or the previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `n`, we can only conclude that we are continuing with the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state reflects that we continue without changing variable values.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` is an integer, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
