Postcondition: ***Given `n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, the values of `dp` depend on the conditions regarding `i`, `j`, and `k`, while `m`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
