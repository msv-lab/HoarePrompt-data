Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is either 1 or greater than 1, and `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and all values remain unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is not updated. If `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of valid previous states in the `dp` array, ensuring that all edge cases regarding the bounds of `j`, `k`, and the initial conditions of `i` are handled appropriately.**
