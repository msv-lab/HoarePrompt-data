Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, and `dp` is a two-dimensional list initialized with zeros of size (2, m + 2) and (s + 1) for each inner list. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the `dp` array remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, both modulo `mod`. This covers all possible cases for the variables involved.***
