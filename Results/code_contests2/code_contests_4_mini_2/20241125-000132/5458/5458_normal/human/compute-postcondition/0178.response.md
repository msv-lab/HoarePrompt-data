According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `k` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4, and `s` must be at least 4 since `s` is defined as a user-defined integer greater than 2 and within the range of 1 to 3000. Given that `s` is user-defined and can be any integer within that range, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 4 and within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 1, and `k` is 4.**
