The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies a multidimensional array or list called `dp`. The indices for `dp` are calculated as follows:

- `i + 1 & 1`: The value of `i` is 0, so `0 + 1 & 1` equals `1 & 1`, which results in `1`.
- `j + 1`: The value of `j` is 2, so `2 + 1` equals `3`.
- `k`: The value of `k` is 3.

Therefore, the operation modifies `dp[1][3][3]`, setting its value to `1`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 2 to 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1.**
