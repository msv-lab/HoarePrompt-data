The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is within, moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration without modifying any variables.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 3 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is either 1 or greater than 1, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration.**
