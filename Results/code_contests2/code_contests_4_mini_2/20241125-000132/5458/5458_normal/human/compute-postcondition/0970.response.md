Since the `while` loop is structured as `while 1`, it implies that the loop will continue to execute indefinitely. Therefore, there are no conditions that would prevent the loop from executing again.

Given this, I do not need to make any adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7; `m` is between 1 and 2000; `s` is between 1 and 3000; the output is `dp[n`**
