According to the code, the for loop iterates over the variable `k` starting from 1 up to `s + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have `k` equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Additionally, since the loop continues while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `s` must be at least 3 in order for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `k` needs to be updated to 3.
- `s` needs to be updated to at least 3.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is at least `m + 1`, and `k` is 3**
