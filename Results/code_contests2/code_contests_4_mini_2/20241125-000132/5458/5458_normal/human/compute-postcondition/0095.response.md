Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 2, `i` is equal to 0, and if `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program continues without modifying the `dp` array.**
