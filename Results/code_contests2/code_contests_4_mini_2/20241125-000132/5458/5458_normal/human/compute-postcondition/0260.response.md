The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead causes the current iteration of the loop to end and the next iteration to begin. No variables are affected by this statement in the current context. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
