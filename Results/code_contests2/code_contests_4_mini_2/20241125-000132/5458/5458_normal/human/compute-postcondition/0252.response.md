According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`, which determines the range of `k`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, as it iterates from 1 to `s`. Given that `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, it can execute. The initial value of `k` should be set to 1 at the start of the loop.

In summary, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `k` starts at 1, since the loop is defined to start from 1 and iterate up to `s`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j` do not directly impact the execution of this loop.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is 2, `k` is 1**
