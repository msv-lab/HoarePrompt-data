The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 3, `k` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
