Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) and (s + 1). If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, where `i` is 0, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is 1. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of `dp`.***
