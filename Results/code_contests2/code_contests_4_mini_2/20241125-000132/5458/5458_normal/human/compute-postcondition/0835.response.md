The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables; instead, it is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
