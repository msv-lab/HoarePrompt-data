The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since it does not change the values of any variables, the output state remains largely unchanged. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `i`, and `k` retain their previous values since the execution of the `continue` statement does not affect them directly.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as before the statement was executed, but we note that we skip the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` has been modified, `j` is greater than 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `k` is 1, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
