According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for values of `j` in the range from 1 to `m`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `j` is currently at its maximum value of `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be increased. Additionally, since the loop is set to start from 1, `j` must be set to 1 for the next iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `m` must be greater than the previous value to allow `j` to take on the next value (which is `m + 1`).
- Set `j` back to 1 since the loop will start over.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is the previous value, `m` is greater than the previous value, `j` is 1**
