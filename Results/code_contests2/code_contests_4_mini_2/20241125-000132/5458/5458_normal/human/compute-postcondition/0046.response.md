Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is j + 1 and is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1.***
