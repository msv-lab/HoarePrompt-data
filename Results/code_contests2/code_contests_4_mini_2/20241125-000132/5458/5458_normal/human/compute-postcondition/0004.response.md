Postcondition: ***Given that `n`, `m`, and `s` are user-defined integers within the ranges of 1 to 7, 1 to 2000, and 1 to 3000 respectively, and `mod` is set to 100000, if `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all other cases, the program continues executing without any break, ensuring `n`, `m`, and `s` remain within their defined ranges.***
