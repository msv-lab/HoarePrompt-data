Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and `i` can be either 0 or non-zero. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged for this case. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and also adds `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it, accounting for possible cases where `k - j` is valid.***
