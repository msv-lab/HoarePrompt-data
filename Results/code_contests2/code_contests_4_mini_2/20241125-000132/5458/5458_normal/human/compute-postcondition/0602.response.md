Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and continues to the next iteration of the loop, effectively skipping the remaining code in the current iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes occur to the variables, and the program proceeds without skipping the iteration.***
