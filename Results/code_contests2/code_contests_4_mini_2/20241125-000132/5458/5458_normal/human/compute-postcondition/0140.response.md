Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 3 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is either 1 or greater than 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration. In the case where `j` is not greater than `k`, this program fragment does not execute, and the values of `dp` remain unchanged. Additionally, edge cases where `j` equals `k` should also be considered, as they result in no update to `dp`.***
