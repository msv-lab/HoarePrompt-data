Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is at least `m + 1`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of `dp` and the loop will not proceed with this update.***
