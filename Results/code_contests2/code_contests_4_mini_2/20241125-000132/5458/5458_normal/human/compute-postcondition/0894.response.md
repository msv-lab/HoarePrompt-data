Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The updates to `dp` are modulo `mod`.***
