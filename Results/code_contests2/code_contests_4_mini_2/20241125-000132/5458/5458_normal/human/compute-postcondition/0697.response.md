Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` has been modified, `j` is greater than 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the current iteration continues normally.***
