Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `dp` remains unchanged. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since `n` cannot be 0 under the given precondition, the break statement will not be executed. Thus, the state of the program remains unchanged, with `n`, `m`, `s`, and `dp` retaining their respective values.***
