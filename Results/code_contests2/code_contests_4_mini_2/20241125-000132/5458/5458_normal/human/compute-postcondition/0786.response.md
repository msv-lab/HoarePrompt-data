Postcondition: ***`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made, and the current iteration continues.***
