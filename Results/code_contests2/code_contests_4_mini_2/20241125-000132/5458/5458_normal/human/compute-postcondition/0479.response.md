Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not modify `dp` and will proceed to the next part of the loop without any changes.***
