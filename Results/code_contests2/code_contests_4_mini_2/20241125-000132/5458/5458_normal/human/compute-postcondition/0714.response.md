The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. As a result, the values of the variables do not change, and the program continues with the next cycle of the loop. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is 3001, `k` is 3000, and the `continue` statement indicates that we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is 3001, `k` is 3000, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
