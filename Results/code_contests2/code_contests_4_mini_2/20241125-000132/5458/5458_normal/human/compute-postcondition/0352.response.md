Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a two-dimensional list initialized with zeros of size (2, m + 2) and (s + 1) for each inner list, and `k` is `s + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring that all potential values for `j` relative to `k` are accounted for.***
