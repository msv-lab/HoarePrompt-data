The values of the variables do not change but we continue with the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, and the value of dp[1][j + 1][k] is set to dp[1][j][k].
