The statement modifies the `dp` array at the indices `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are provided in the initial state, but the specific values of `dp` are not given, so we cannot calculate the exact changes to `dp`.

However, we can analyze the impact of the code: 

1. The value `i + 1 & 1` will be calculated based on the value of `i`, which is 0. Therefore, `i + 1` is 1, and `1 & 1` results in 1.
2. The value of `j + 1` can be evaluated since `j` is initially `m + 1`.
3. The value of `k` remains 2.
4. The term `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` uses the value of `i` (0), which results in `i & 1` being 0. Thus, it accesses `dp[0][j][k - j]`.

The code line updates `dp[1][j + 1][2]` by adding the value of `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`, but without specific values for `dp`, we cannot determine any further specific updates. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `i`, `j`, `s`, `k`, and a description of the update to `dp`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is updated by adding `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`**
