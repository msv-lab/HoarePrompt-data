Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), then the `dp` array is modified at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
