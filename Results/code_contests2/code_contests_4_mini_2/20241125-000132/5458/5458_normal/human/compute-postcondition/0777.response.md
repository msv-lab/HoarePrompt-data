Postcondition: ***`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. There is no change to the state of the program if `j` is less than or equal to `k`.***
