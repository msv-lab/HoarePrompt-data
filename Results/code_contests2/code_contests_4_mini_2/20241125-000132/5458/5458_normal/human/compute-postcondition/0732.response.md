The statement assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, but the previous state of `dp` is not provided, nor are the values of `j` and `mod`. Since `j` is only mentioned to be greater than `k`, the condition `j <= k` does not apply, and thus we proceed with the assignment.

The impact of the code is that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Without specific values for `j`, `mod`, or the current state of `dp`, we cannot determine exact values, but we know that `dp` is being modified based on the current state.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on a modulus operation, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 2 and 2001, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
