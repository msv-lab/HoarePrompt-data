Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, and `k` is greater than `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, leaving the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` unchanged from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no state change specified in the provided fragment.***
