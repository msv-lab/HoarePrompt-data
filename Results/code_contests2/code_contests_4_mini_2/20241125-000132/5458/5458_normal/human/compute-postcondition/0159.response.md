Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. In all cases, the updates to `dp` maintain the consistency of array indexing and respect the constraints applied by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
