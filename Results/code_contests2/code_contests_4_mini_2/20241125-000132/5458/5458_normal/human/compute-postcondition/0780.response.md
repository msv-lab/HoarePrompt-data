Postcondition: ***`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous state of `dp`, specifically by taking the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` or by adding values from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, while ensuring all operations are modulo `mod`. All conditions retain their original relationships as stated in the precondition.***
