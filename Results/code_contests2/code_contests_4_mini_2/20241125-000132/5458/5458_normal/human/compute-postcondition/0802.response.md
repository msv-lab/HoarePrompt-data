Postcondition: ***`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the `dp` array is updated at the specified indices, specifically `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no updates to the `dp` array occur, and the program may proceed based on subsequent logic outside this conditional block.***
