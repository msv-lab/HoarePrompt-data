According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1, which is already satisfied since `s` is at least 1. The variable `k` is defined and will start at 1 for the first iteration. 

Since `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute with `k` starting from 1, and it will iterate up to `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` do not affect the execution of this loop directly.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are minimal as `s` is already valid and `k` starts from a valid point.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1**
