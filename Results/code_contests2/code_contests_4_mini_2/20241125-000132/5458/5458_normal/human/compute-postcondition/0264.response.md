Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to the value of `dp[1][2][1]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is updated based on the values in `dp` arrays according to the provided operations, ensuring appropriate modular arithmetic is applied. Edge cases regarding the comparisons of `j` and `k`, and the operations on `dp` arrays are handled within the stated conditions.***
