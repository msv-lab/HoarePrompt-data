The code updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous values of the affected variables are `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, and `mod`. 

Since the initial state indicates that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, we can infer that it will now hold a new value based on the addition. 

The value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` will be added to whatever value was previously stored in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
