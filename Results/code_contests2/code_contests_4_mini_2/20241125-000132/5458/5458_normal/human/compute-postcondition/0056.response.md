The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional array `dp` and assigning the value `1` to a specific location based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The variable `j` is incremented by 1, so its new value will be `j + 1`.
2. The value of `k` is given as `2`.
3. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will yield either `0` or `1`, depending on the value of `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific value for `i + 1 & 1`.

Since the assignment operation modifies the `dp` array but does not affect the other variables, we will note that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`, while the states of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain as defined.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**.
