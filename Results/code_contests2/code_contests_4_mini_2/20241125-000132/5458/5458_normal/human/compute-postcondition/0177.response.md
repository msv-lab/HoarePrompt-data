Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than 2 and within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]` will be assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][3]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k` in the else part, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]` is computed using `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][3]` modulo `mod` and also updated with a value derived from `dp[i & 1][1][2]` modulo `mod`. In all cases, the conditions regarding the bounds of `n`, `m`, `s`, and the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain satisfied.***
