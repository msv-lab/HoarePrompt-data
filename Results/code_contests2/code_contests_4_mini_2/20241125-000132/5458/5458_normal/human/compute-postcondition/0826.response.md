To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given conditions:

1. The for loop iterates over `j` in the range from `1` to `m + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.

2. The state mentions that if `j < 1`, the loop does not execute, implying that `j` must be at least `1` for the loop to run.

3. The conditions also mention that if `i is 0 and j >= k for all k from 1 to s`, certain updates to `dp` occur, and if `i is not 0`, `dp` is updated based on other conditions. However, these conditions do not affect the current state adjustment for the loop execution.

4. The state does mention that if `s` is `0` or negative, `dp` remains unchanged, but this does not affect the loop execution directly.

Given this understanding, we need to adjust `j` for the loop to execute one more time. If the last iteration of the loop had `j` less than or equal to `m`, we can set `j` to the next value in the range.

Assuming that `j` was `m` in the last iteration, we need to set `j` to `m + 1` to ensure that the loop would not execute again. However, if `j` is currently less than `m`, we need to increment `j` accordingly.

Since the specifics of `j` are not provided in the state, we will assume it must be adjusted to `m + 1` for the loop to be ready for the next potential execution, indicating the loop would not run again.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`i is 0, j is m + 1, s is non-negative, dp remains unchanged`**
