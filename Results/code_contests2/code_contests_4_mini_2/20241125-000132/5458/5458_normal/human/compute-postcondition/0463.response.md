Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][2]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not modify `dp` and proceeds accordingly.***
