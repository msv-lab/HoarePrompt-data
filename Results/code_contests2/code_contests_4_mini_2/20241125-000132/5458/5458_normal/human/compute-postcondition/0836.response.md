Postcondition: ***`i` is greater than 0, `j` is `m + 1`, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged as it is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged and no further operations occur in this iteration.***
