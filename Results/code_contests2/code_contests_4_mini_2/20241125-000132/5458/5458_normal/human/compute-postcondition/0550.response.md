Postcondition: ***Given `n` is 7, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur to `dp` and the program also continues to the next iteration of the loop. Thus, the program proceeds to the next iteration regardless of whether the if condition is met or not.***
