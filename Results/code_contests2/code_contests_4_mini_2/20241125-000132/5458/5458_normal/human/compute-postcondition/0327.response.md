Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, and `dp` remains unchanged. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since `n` cannot be 0 based on the precondition, this condition will never be satisfied, and the program continues without breaking.***
