Output State: **If `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute `s` times, updating the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` will be set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the `dp` values and taken modulo `mod`. If `s` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `dp` remains unchanged. In all cases, `n` is within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, and `j` is 1, with `k` ranging from 1 to `s`.**
