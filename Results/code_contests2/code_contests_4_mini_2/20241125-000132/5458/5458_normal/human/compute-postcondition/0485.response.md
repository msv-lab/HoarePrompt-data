Postcondition: ***Given `n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. There are no changes made to the state of the program if `j` is less than `k`, as there is no else part in the code.***
