Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` and it remains unchanged.***
