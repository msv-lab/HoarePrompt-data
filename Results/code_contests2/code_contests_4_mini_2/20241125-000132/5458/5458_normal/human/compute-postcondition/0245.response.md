Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In the case where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no modifications are made to the `dp` array.***
