According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `m`. The loop iterates from `1` to `m + 1`, meaning it will execute for each value of `j` starting at `1` up to and including `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is currently less than or equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `m` at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, if `j` is currently equal to `m`, we will need to adjust `j` to `m + 1`, where it will not execute again since it will exceed the upper limit of `m + 1`. 

Since the loop will not execute if `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and given that we want to allow one more iteration, we need to infer that `j` must be adjusted back to `m` for it to be less than `m + 1`.

Additionally, since no other variables are affected during the loop execution, the states for `n`, `m`, `s`, and `dp` remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2D list that may have been modified, `j` is m, `i` is 0**
