The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` suggests an assignment in a multi-dimensional list or array, but without the specific values of `i`, `j`, or the structure of `dp`, we cannot derive concrete values or effects from this operation. 

The only direct impact of the code is the assignment of one element of the `dp` array based on another element. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, we can state the output considering the unchanged values and the nature of the operation.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and the assignment in `dp` occurs.**
