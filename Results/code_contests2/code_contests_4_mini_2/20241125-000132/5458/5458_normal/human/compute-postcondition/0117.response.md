Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. There are no other conditions to consider, as there is no else part in the code.***
