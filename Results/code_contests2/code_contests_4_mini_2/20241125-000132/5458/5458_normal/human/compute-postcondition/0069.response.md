Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. There is no else part in the code.***
