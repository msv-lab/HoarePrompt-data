The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves array indexing using the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The value of `i` is 0, thus `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
2. The value of `j` is 1, so `j + 1` evaluates to `2`.
3. The value of `k` is 2.

This means that:
- The left-hand side of the equation is `dp[1][2][2]`.
- The right-hand side is `dp[1][1][2]`, which is taken from the same array.

The state of `dp[1][2][2]` gets updated to the value of `dp[1][1][2]`. Since the actual values of the `dp` array are not provided in the initial state, we can't specify what that value is, but we know that `dp[1][2][2]` now holds the value of `dp[1][1][2]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state describes the relationship established in the `dp` array.

Output State: **`n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][2]`**
