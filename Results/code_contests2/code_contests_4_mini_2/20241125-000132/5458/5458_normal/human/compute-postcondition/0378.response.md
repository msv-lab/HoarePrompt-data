To determine how to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the current parameters and the loop construct.

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. This means that the loop will continue executing as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented for the next iteration.

3. **Validating Increment**: The next value for `k` after the current iteration would be 2. We must ensure that this value is still within the range defined by the loop condition (`1 to s + 1`). Given that `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `s + 1` would be between 2 and 8.

4. **Conclusion**: Since `k` is currently 1, and incrementing it to 2 is valid (as it meets the loop condition), we can adjust `k` accordingly.

Thus, the adjustments required for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2**.
