Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. This ensures that all conditions regarding the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are handled appropriately.***
