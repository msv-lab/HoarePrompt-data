Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2D list filled with zeros, and `k` is `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp` and control proceeds to the subsequent code block.***
