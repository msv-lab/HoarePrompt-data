According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `k` as 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4. Therefore, `k` should be adjusted to 4, and since we are not changing `s`, it will remain greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 4**
