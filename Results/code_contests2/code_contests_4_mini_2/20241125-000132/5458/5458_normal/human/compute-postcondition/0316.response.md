Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the values of `s`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the operation may lead to an undefined state due to potential out-of-bounds indexing when accessing `dp` in the else part. This scenario needs careful handling to prevent any runtime errors.***
