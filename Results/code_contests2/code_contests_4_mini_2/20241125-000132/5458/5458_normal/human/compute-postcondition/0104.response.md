Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is an integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is an integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 3, `i` is equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod because `j` is greater than `k`.**
