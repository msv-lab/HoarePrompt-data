According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1. Since `j` is 1 and `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, these states do not directly affect the loop's execution. At the end of the last iteration, `k` will be equal to `s`, and it will have iterated from 1 to `s`. 

So for the loop to be executed, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` starts at 1, and there are no other dependencies from `i`, `j`, `dp`, or `m` that need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is less than `n^2 - 1, j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
