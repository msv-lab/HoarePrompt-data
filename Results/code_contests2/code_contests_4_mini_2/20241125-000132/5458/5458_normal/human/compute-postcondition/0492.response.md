According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 2, it allows for `k` to be 3. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`.

State: **`n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 3**
