According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2, and `s` should remain greater than or equal to 2, so that the loop can continue executing.

State: **`n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2**
