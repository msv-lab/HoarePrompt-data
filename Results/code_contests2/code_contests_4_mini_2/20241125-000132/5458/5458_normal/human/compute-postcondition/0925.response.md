Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop. There is no change to the values of `s`, `k`, `m`, `i`, and the condition of `j` being less than or equal to `k` is also implicitly satisfied in this case.***
