Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`.***
