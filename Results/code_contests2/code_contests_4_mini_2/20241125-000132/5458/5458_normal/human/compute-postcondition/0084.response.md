The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but skips the current iteration of the loop in which it resides. Therefore, the output state reflects that there is no change to the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
