The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop without executing any further code in the current iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 7, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
