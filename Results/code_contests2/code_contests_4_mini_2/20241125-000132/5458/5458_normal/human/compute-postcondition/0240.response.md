According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000 (specifically at least 4 since `n` is at least 4). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**
