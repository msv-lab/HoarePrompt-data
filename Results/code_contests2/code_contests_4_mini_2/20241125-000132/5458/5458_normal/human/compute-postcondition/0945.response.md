According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop runs for values of `k` in the range from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1, which means that there is potential for the loop to execute again if `k` can increment.

To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `s` is at least 1, this condition will still hold true as long as `s` is at least 2. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `k` is now 2.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and `i` can be either 0 or non-zero.**
