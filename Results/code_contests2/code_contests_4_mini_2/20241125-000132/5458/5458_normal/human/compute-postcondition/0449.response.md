According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` must be less than `s + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. This means that `s` is at least 1, allowing the loop to execute. After the current iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `k` to account for the next value it will take. Since `k` is currently at 1, it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration. However, we must also ensure that `s` is at least 2 for the loop to run again.

Thus, we adjust the states as follows:
- `k` should be updated to 2.
- `s` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2**
