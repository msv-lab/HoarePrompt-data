Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `i` is 0. If `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, specifically `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is set to 1. There is no else part in the code, so no actions are taken if `j` is less than `k`.***
