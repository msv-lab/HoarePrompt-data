Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, and `dp` is a two-dimensional list initialized with zeros of size (2, m + 2) and (s + 1) for each inner list. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while the state of `dp` remains unchanged for other indices. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program continues without modifying `dp`.***
