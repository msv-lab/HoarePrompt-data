The code snippet updates the `dp` array based on the current indices, but since `j` is not greater than `k`, it does not change the state of `dp`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `n` do not affect the `dp` values directly as no specific assignments are made. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than 2 and within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and the values of `dp` remain unchanged.**
