Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is updated with the value from `dp[1][2][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
