The values of the variables do not change with the `continue` statement, but we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop we are directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 2 to 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
