According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2, and `s` must be at least 2 to ensure that `k` is still within the range of `1` to `s`.

The states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
- `k` needs to be updated to 2.
- `s` needs to be at least 2 to allow `k` to execute one more time.

No other states need to be modified.

State: **`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2.**
