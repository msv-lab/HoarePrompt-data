Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n^2 - 1`, and `m` is greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made, and the loop continues without executing the body of the if statement.***
