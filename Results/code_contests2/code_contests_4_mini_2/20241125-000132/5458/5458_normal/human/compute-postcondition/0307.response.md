Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp[1][4][2]`. In the else part, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][2]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the access to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is invalid due to negative index, which should be accounted for in the overall conditions. Thus, the final state of `dp[1][4][2]` depends on the comparison of `j` and `k`, with potential invalid access to negative indices in scenarios where `j` is less than or equal to `k`.***
