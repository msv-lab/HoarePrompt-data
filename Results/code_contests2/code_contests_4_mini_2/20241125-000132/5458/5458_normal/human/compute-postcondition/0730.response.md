The `continue` statement does not change the state of any variables directly; it simply skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect that we are continuing the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 2 and 2001, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
