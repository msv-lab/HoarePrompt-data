Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and `i` can be either 0 or non-zero. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp` and the iteration continues normally.***
