According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is between 2 and 2001. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by one, starting from 1, so it will be at least 2. 

Since `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `m`, for the next iteration, `j` will be 2 if `m` is at least 2. The variable `j` needs to be adjusted to ensure it reflects the next iteration. Therefore, the state should be updated as follows:

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 2 and 2001, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 2**
