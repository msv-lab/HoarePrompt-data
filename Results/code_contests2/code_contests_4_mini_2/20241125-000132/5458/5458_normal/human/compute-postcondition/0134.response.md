Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is either 1 or greater than 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than 2, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0, when `j` is greater than 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][2]`, and if `j` is less than or equal to 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is calculated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][2]` and `dp[i & 1][j][0]`, ensuring all edge cases for the values of `j` are handled appropriately.***
