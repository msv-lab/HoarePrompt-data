Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and `j` is `m + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. All updates to `dp` respect the boundaries set by `n`, `m`, `j`, and `k`, ensuring proper handling of edge cases based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The state of `dp` remains unchanged for cases not explicitly handled by the conditions.***
