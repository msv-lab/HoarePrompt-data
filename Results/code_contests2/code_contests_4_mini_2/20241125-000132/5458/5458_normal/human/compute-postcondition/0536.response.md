Output State: **If `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once with `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. After 1 iteration, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and incorporates `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `s` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `k` will not change, maintaining its initial value of 0. The indices of `dp` must also be validated to ensure no out-of-bounds access occurs during the execution.**
