Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0, `dp[1][m + 1][3]` becomes 1, and if `i` is non-zero, `dp[0][m + 1][3]` becomes 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`.***
