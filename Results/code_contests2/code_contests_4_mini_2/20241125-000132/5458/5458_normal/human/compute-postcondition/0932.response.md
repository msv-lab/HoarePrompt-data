According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1, which it is in this case. The loop variable `k` will start at 1 and go up to and including `s`. 

Since `s` is at least 1, `k` will be initialized to 1 at the start, and it will be the first value that the loop takes. The variable `j` does not affect the execution of the loop directly.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the state can remain as it is with the current values of `s` and `j`, while ensuring `k` starts at 1. 

State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1**
