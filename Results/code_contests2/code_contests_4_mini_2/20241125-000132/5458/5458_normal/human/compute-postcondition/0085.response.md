Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates the state of the `dp` array at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to match the value at `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. There is no else part, thus, no other modifications to `dp` or loop behavior are specified.***
