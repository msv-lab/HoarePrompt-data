Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 2 to 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` array and the loop proceeds without any specific operation.***
