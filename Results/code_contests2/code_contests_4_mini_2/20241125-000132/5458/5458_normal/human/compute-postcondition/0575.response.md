According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1, which is already given in the state. The loop index `k` starts at 1 and goes up to `s`, so `k` should start at 1 before the loop executes. The conditions for `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` do not directly affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute correctly, the states can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
