Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is equal to `s` and is between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
