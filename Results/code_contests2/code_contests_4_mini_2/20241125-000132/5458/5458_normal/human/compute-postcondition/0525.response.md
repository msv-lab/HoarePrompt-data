Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is at least `m + 1`, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and then increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Potential out-of-bounds access to `dp` is handled, ensuring that the indices do not exceed the allocated sizes of the multidimensional array.***
