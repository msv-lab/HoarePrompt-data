The code `continue` does not change any variable values but instructs the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with the value from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is greater than 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with the value from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is greater than 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
