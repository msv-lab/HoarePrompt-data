According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Additionally, since the loop iterates from 1 to `s + 1`, `s` must be at least 3 to allow for `k` to reach 3.

Given that `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, it must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 3 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is either 1 or greater than 1, and `k` is 3.**
