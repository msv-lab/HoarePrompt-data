To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided conditions and the for loop statement.

1. The loop iterates over `j`, which ranges from `1` to `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least `1`.
2. The current value of `i` is `n`, which is between `4` and `7`. This value does not influence the execution of the loop but indicates that `i` is initialized to a value within that range before the loop starts.
3. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `s` do not need to be changed as long as `m` is greater than or equal to `1`.

Given this analysis, the required states for the loop execution are:

- `m` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute.
- The value of `j` will start at `1` and increment with each iteration, so we can state that `j` is initialized to `1`.

Thus, the modified state will include:

State: **`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a modified 2D list based on the conditions applied during the loop execution, `i` is `n`, `j` is 1**
