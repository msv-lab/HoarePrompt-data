The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are given values: `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is 2. The expression `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1`, which equals `1`. Thus, the assignment can be rewritten as `dp[1][4][2] = dp[1][3][2]`. The other variables `s` and `n` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][2]**.
