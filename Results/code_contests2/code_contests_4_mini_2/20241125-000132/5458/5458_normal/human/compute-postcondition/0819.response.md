The code contains a `continue` statement, which does not change any variable values or states but instead skips the current iteration of the most inner loop. Since no specific values are altered and the variables retain their previous states, the output state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and we continue in the most internal loop.**
