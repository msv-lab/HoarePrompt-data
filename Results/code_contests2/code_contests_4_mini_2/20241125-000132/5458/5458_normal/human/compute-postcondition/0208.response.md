Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `n` is within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then there are no changes made to the state.***
