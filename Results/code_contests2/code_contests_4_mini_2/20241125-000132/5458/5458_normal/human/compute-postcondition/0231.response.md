To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop.

1. The loop iterates over `k` in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`.

2. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `1`. Given that `s` is within the range of `1 to 3000`, `k` can take values from `1` to `s`.

3. Since `k` is currently `1` and `s` is at least `4`, the loop can execute at least once more as `s` is greater than `1`.

4. In the next iteration, `k` will become `2`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this increment in `k`.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the value of `k`, which should be updated to `2`.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is 1, `k` is 2**
