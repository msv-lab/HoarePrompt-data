The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables do not change, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop we are in. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a two-dimensional list initialized with zeros of size (2, m + 2) and (s + 1) for each inner list, `k` is `s + 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
