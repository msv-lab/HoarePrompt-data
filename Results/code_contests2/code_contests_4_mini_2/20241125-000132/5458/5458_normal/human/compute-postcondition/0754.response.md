Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 2 and 2001, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and for each iteration `k` from 1 to `s`: if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, for `i` not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The loop will not execute if `s` is less than 1; in such cases, `k` remains undefined and `dp` remains unchanged.**
