The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the remaining statements in the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, and we note that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
