The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the 3-dimensional array `dp` at the specified indices. It assigns the value `1` to `dp` at the position calculated by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. 

The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. The value of `j` is 2, so `j + 1` will evaluate to `3`. The value of `k` remains as `1`.

Thus, the assignment affects the `dp` array at indices `[1][3][1]`.

Other variables (`s`, `m`, `n`, etc.) are not modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1**.
