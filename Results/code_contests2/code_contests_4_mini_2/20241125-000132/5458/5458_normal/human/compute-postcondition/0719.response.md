According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 3001, which means that `k` can take values from 1 to 3001. Since `k` is currently at 3000, it will execute one more time to reach 3001.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` must be adjusted to 3001.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, and `j` do not directly impact the loop condition.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is 3001, `dp` is a modified 2D list, `k` is 3001**
