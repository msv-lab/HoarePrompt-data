According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `m`, inclusive. If `m` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute at least once. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `j` will be at its maximum value of `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `m + 1`. However, since the loop condition checks for `j` being less than or equal to `m`, the loop will not execute again unless `m` is increased.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state must reflect that `m` is at least `m + 1` (which means `m` needs to be increased), and `j` needs to be set to `m + 1`.

State: **`s is at least 1, m is at least m + 1, j is m + 1`**
