The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the execution flow is altered by skipping any remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state is that the values of the variables do not change, and we continue to the next iteration in the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 2 and 2001, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration in the loop.**
