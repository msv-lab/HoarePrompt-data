Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is at least `m + 1`, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the continuation behavior is not specified.***
