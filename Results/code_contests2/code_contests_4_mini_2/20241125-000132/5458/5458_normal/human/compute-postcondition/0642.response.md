According to the code, the loop will execute if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 4. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `m`.

Since `j` is currently 3, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 4, which is still within the bounds of `m` (which is at least 3).

State: **`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 4, and `s` is at least 1.**
