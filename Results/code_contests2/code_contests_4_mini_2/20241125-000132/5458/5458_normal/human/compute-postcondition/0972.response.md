The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes multiple datasets consisting of integers `n`, `m`, and `s`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 7 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), and `s` is an integer between 1 and 3000 (inclusive). The input ends when a line containing three zeros is encountered. The function likely performs some operations based on the provided datasets and returns a result, though the specifics of the output are not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of integers n, m, and s within specified ranges and ends input processing when all three values are zero. The specific output based on these datasets is not described.**
