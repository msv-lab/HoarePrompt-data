According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `n`. The loop will iterate `n ** 2` times, so for it to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unchanged, and `n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be equal to `n ** 2 - 1`.

Since `n` can range from 1 to 7, the maximum value of `n ** 2` is 49 (when `n` is 7). Thus, `i` should be adjusted to be 49 if `n` is 7, but for any other value of `n`, `i` will be less than `n ** 2`. 

As `n` is a user-defined integer from the range of 1 to 7, we can state that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be equal to `n ** 2 - 1`.

State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is less than `n ** 2`, `j` remains unchanged**.
