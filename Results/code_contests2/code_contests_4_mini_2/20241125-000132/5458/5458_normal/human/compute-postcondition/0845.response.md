Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program does not continue to the next iteration.***
