Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, there are no changes made to the state of the variables or the `dp` array.***
