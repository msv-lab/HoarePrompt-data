Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is 3001, and `k` is 3000, if `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates the `dp` list at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no actions are taken within this block, and the program continues with the next part of the loop without modifying `dp`.***
