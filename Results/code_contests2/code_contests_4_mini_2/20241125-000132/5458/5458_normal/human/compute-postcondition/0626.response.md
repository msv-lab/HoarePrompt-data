The code snippet `continue` does not change the state of any variables directly. Instead, it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
