Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. The case where `j` is less than or equal to `k` does not modify any variables or the state of the program.***
