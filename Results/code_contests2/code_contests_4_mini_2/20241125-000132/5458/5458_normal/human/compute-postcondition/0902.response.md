Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, which means `dp[1][3][1]` is updated to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the `dp` array.***
