Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is greater than 0. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not update `dp` and continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
