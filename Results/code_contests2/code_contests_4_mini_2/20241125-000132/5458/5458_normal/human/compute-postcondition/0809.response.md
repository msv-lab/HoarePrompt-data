The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` are not directly modified, and their previous values remain unchanged. The specific value of `i` is not provided, but it influences the indexing of `dp`. 

Since `j` is incremented by 1, it changes from 2 to 3. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 3, `k` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 3, `k` is 2**
