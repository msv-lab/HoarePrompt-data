Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 2 and 2001, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, and additionally includes the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This ensures all possible cases for the variable `j` relative to `k` are accounted for in the updates to the `dp` array.***
