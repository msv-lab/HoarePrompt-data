The code attempts to assign the value `1` to a multidimensional array `dp` at the indices calculated from the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`, and `k` is `1`, letâ€™s compute the indices:

- `i + 1 & 1` results in `0 + 1 & 1`, which evaluates to `1 & 1` = `1`. This means the first index is `1`.
- `j + 1` results in `2 + 1`, which is `3`.
- The value of `k` is `1`.

Thus, the assignment will set `dp[1][3][1]` to `1`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Consequently, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the new assignment made to the `dp` array. 

Output State: **`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1**.
