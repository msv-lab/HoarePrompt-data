Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is either 1 or greater than 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` structure.**
