Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 2 and 2001, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute any updates and proceeds without changes to the `dp` array.***
