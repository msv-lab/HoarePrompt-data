Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a modified 2D list. If `i` is 0 and `j` (which is equal to `m`) is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][1]` if `j` is greater than 1, or it is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][0]` if the conditions are met, indicating that the value at that position in the 2D list has been altered based on the calculations involving the previous values in the list. If `j` is less than 1, no changes occur to the `dp` list.***
