Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is 3001, `dp` is a modified 2D list, and `k` is 3000. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there is no modification to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and then it is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
