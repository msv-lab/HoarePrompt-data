The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The initial values of `s`, `k`, `m`, `i`, and the conditions involving `j` remain unchanged, as the assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, while also indicating the assignment has occurred.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
