Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][3]` is set to `dp[1][1][3]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][3]` is updated by taking `dp[1][1][3] % mod` and adding `dp[0][1][0] % mod`, ensuring that all modifications to `dp` respect the modulo operation.***
