The code modifies the `dp` array based on the indices derived from the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. However, since `j` (which is 1) is not greater than `k` (which is 2), no changes occur to the `dp` array, and the program proceeds without modifying `dp`. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and no changes occur to the `dp` array.**
