The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The previous values of the variables remain the same. Thus, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is equal to `s` and is between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is equal to `s` and is between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
