Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 2 and 2001, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 1, and if `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, there is no change to `dp`. If `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
