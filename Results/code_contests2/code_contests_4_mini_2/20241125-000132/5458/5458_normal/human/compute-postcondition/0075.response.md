According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`, which determines the upper limit of the loop. The loop executes for `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` would need to be equal to `m + 1` for the loop to terminate.

Given that `j` was just incremented in the last iteration, the state must reflect that `j` is now `m + 1` in order for the loop to terminate correctly.

State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`**
