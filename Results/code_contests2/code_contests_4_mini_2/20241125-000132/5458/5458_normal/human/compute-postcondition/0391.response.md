The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop without modifying any variable values.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
