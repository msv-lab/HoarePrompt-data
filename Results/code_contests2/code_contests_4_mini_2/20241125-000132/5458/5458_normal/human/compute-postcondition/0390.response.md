The code snippet provided is manipulating a multi-dimensional list, `dp`, using indices that incorporate the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since the initial state doesn't define specific values for `i` and `j`, but outlines the variable types and ranges, we will analyze the impact based on the provided ranges:

- `n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7.
- `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000.
- `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `k` is initialized as 3.

The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is dependent on the values of `i`, `j`, and the fixed value of `k`. The left-hand side of the assignment is set equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `dp` are not provided, we cannot determine specific outcomes for `dp` or the values of `i` and `j`. However, we can note that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will now reflect the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Therefore, the output state reflecting the operation performed is:

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
