The code contains a `continue` statement, which is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the state of the variables is not altered by this statement and the only effect is on the flow of control within a loop, the output state will reflect that no changes have occurred to the variables.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n^2 - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
