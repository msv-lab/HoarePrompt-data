According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop iterates over `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 (since it's the last value in the loop range) and `s` is at least 3 (as stated in the previous iteration). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4, and `s` must be at least 4 to satisfy the condition for the next iteration. Thus, the state of `s` needs to be adjusted to be at least 4.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is at least `m + 1`, `k` is 4**
