Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the current loop iteration is skipped. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program proceeds to the next iteration without modifying `dp`.***
