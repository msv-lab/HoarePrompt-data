To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the states involved:

1. The loop iterates over `k` in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.

2. At the end of the previous iteration, we have that `k` is `1`, and `s` is greater than or equal to `1`. This means that since `k` is `1`, the loop can execute again as long as `s` is at least `1`.

3. After the previous iteration, if `k` is `1`, then at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be incremented in the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, `k` will become `2`.

4. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `s` is at least `2`, because if `s` were just `1`, the next value of `k` would be `2`, which would exceed `s + 1` for the next iteration.

Based on this reasoning, we can conclude the following adjustments:

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2**.
