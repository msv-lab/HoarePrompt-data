According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The important variable here is `k`, which starts from 1 and increments by 1 on each iteration of the loop. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 3, and since the loop runs while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, we need to ensure that `k` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time. 

Given that `s` is greater than or equal to 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented to 4. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to 4. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `i` do not directly influence the execution of the loop at this point.

State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 4**
