Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is 1, there is an invalid index access with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, which results in `k - j` being -2. This indicates potential access issues for the dp array if the conditions are not properly managed.***
