The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next one. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the variable values. 

Output State: **`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`; the `dp` array is updated based on the specified indices, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
