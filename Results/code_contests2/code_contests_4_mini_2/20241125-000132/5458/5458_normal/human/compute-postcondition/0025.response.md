The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same with respect to the variable values, but it indicates that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
