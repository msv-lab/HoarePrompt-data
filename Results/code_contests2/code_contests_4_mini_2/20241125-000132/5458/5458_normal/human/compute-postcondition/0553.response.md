Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated to the value of `dp[0][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k` when `i` is 1, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated using the modulus of `dp[0][j][k]` and the value of `dp[0][j][k - j]`. All operations are subject to the modulus constraint `mod`.***
