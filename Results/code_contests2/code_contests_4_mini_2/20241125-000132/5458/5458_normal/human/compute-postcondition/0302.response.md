The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` affects the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either `1` or `0` depending on whether `i` is `0` or `1`, respectively. Since `i` is `0`, the expression evaluates to `1`.
2. The value of `j + 1` results in `4` because `j` is `3`.
3. The current value of `k` remains `2`.

This means the statement accesses `dp[1][4][2]` and sets it equal to the value of `dp[1][3][2]`. Since this action does not change any of the variables `s`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, or `k`, the output state remains unchanged with respect to these variables.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 2**
