The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values. The output state is: `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
