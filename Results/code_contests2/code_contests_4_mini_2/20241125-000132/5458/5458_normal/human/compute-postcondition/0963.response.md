According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 4 (since `k` will increment to 4), and `k` will then be adjusted to 4.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 4**
