Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and if `i` is 0, then if `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than 1, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. In the else part, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, while other variables remain unchanged. Furthermore, all updates to `dp` take into account the boundaries of `j` and `k` to ensure valid indices.***
