According to the code, the ability for the loop to execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2, and `m` must be at least 2 or greater than or equal to 2 to allow this incremented value of `j` to be valid in the next iteration.

Thus, we need to adjust `m` to be greater than or equal to 2. 

State: **`n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
