The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change because they are not affected by the `continue` statement, but we break out of the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 7, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
