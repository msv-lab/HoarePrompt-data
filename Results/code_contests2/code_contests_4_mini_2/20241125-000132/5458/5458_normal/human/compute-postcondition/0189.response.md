The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables and that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n-1`, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
