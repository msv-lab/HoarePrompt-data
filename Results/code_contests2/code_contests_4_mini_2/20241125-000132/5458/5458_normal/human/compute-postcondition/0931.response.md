According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at its maximum value of `m` (since the loop iterates from 1 to `m`). Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `m + 1`. Also, since `s` is at least 1, it does not need adjustment as it allows the loop to execute.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`**
