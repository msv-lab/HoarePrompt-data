Postcondition: ***`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. There is no change in the variables if `j` is less than `k`.***
