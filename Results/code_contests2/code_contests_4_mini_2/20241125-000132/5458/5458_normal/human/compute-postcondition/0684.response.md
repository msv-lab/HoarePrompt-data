Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is equal to `s` and is between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated using the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. All changes to `dp` depend on the values of `j` in relation to `k` and whether `i` is 0 or not.***
