Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is 3001, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without making any changes to `dp`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the state of `dp` remains unaltered, and the program continues execution beyond this if statement.***
