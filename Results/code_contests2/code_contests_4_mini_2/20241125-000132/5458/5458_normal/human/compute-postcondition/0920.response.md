According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, which means the loop will exit if `s` is less than 2, as the range is from 1 to `s + 1`. Since `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be adjusted to at least 2. 

The value of `k` will also be adjusted to 3 for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`**
