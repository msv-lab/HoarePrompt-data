Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation involving `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring all values respect the modulo operation.***
