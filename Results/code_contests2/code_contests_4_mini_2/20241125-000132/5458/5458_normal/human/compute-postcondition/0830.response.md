To analyze the code snippet provided, let's break down the impact of the statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`.

1. **Understanding the variables**:
   - `i` is initially `0`.
   - `j` is `m + 1`, which is greater than or equal to `1`.
   - `s` is greater than or equal to `1`, but it does not affect `dp`.
   - `dp` remains unchanged except for the update happening in the next step.
   - `k` is `1`.

2. **Calculating the indices**:
   - The expression `i + 1 & 1` is evaluated. Since `i` is `0`, `i + 1` equals `1`. The bitwise AND operation `1 & 1` results in `1`.
   - `j + 1` will be at least `m + 2`, which is greater than or equal to `2` (since `j` is at least `1`).
   - `k` is `1`.

3. **Updating the `dp` array**:
   - The code updates `dp[1][j + 1][1] = 1`. Since `j + 1` is at least `2`, this means we are modifying the second dimension of the `dp` array at position `1` in the first dimension and at least `2` in the second dimension with index `1` in the third dimension.

4. **Final State**:
   - The value of `dp` at the specified indices is set to `1`.
   - Other variables (`i`, `j`, `s`, `dp`, `k`) remain unchanged, except for the specific update in `dp`.

Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated at `dp[1][j + 1][1]` to 1, `k` is 1**
