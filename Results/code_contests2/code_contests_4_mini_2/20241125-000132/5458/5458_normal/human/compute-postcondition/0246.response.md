The value of `j` is 1 and the value of `k` is 3. Since `j` (1) is less than or equal to `k` (3), no modifications are made to the `dp` array. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the variables involved.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and no modifications are made to the `dp` array.**
