According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2, and `s` must be at least 2 (since `s` can be equal to 1, but then the loop cannot execute again because `k` would exceed `s`).

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` is 2 (to allow the loop to execute again)
- `s` is greater than or equal to 2 (to ensure `k` remains less than or equal to `s`)

State: **`i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `dp` remains unchanged, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2**
