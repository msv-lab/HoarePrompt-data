The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, it does not change the values of any variables in the current state.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is at least 1
- `k` is 2
- `j` is 2
- `m` is greater than or equal to 2
- `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`

Since the `continue` statement does not affect any of the variables, the output state remains unchanged except for the indication that we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
