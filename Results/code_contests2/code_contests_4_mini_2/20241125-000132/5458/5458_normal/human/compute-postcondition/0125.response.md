Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is either 1 or greater than 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is updated based on the conditions, with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` being assigned either the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` or the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Edge cases such as `j` being equal to `k` or `j` being less than or equal to `1` are also addressed in the program's logic, ensuring all scenarios are accounted for.***
