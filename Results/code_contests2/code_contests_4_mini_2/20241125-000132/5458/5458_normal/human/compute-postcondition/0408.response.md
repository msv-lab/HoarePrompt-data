Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. There is no else part, so if `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the variables or the `dp` array in this block.***
