Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2D list filled with zeros, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, there is no update or action taken in the program fragment.***
