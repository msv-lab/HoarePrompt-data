The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Since no variables are affected, the output state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
