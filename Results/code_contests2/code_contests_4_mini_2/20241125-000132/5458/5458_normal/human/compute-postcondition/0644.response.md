According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains 7, so `n ** 2` is 49. The value of `i` is either 0 or 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than 49. Given that `i` is either 0 or 1, both values satisfy this condition. Therefore, `i` can simply be incremented for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted since `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` do not affect the execution condition of the loop.

State: **`n` remains 7, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1 and can be up to `m`, `s` is at least 1, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s`.**
