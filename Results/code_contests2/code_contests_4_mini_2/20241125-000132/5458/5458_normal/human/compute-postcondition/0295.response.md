Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. There are no changes made to the program state when `j` is not greater than `k`, as there is no else part in the code.***
