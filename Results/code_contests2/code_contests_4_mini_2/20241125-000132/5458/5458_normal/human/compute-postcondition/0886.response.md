According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `k`.

The other variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `m` do not need to be modified as they remain unchanged and are still valid for the next iteration.

State: **`i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3**
