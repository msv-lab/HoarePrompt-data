The code updates the `dp` array at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged in their respective states, while the specific values of `dp` will depend on the previous state at the given indices. Since `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is `m + 1` (which is greater than 1), we can focus on the assignment to `dp`.

The output state does not change the values of `i`, `j`, `s`, or `k`, and only modifies `dp` at the specified index based on the previous state of `dp`. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is unchanged, `k` is 1, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
