Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and `j` is `m + 1`. If `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. There is no else part in the code to handle cases when `j` is less than `k`, hence the state of `dp` remains unchanged in those scenarios. The updates to `dp` respect the boundaries set by `n`, `m`, and the conditions on `j` and `k`.***
