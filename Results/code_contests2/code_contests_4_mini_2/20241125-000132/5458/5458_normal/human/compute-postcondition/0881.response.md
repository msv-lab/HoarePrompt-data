The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this command, but it indicates that execution will move to the next iteration of the loop where this command is located. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and notes that we will continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]` to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
