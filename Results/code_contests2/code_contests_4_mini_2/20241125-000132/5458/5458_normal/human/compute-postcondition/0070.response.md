The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, taking the modulo with `mod`. The initial state does not specify the values of `dp`, `i`, or `mod`, therefore the actual output of the assignment cannot be determined. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` are unaffected by this line of code. 

Since `j` is incremented by 1, it is now greater than `k` (which is 3), and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, bypassing any other statements.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is greater than 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
