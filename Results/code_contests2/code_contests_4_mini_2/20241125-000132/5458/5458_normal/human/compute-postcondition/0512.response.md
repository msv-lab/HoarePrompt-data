The code `continue` is a control statement that causes the program to skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `s`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `i` are not changed by this statement, but we are assuming that we are within a loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same for the variables, and we note that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is `m + 1` and is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
