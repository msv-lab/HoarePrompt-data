Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. There are no changes to the variables if `j` is not greater than `k`, as there is no else part in the code.***
