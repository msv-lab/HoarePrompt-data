According to the code, the loop executes for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` would have taken the value of `s` if the loop was allowed to run its full course. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be less than `s`. 

Given that `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, we can adjust the condition of `k` such that it is less than `s`. Therefore, we need to set `k` to `s` and confirm that `k` is now incremented to `s + 1` for the next state.

Since there are no other variables to adjust based on the loop's condition, the only state that needs to be modified is for `k`.

State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `k` is equal to `s + 1`**
