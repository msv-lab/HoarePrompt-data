The code is assigning the value `1` to the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables involved in this operation are `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Initially:
- `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`.
- `j` is at least `2`, so `j + 1` is at least `3`.
- `k` is `1`.

Thus, the assignment affects the state of the `dp` array at `dp[1][j + 1][1]`, where `j + 1` is at least `3`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
