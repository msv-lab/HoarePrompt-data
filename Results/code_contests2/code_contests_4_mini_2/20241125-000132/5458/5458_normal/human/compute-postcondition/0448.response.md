Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to `dp`. If `i` is 7 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` without changes to `dp`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The state of `dp` is modified accordingly based on the conditions outlined.***
