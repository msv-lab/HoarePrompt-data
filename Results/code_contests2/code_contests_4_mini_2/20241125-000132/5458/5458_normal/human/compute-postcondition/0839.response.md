Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged with the updates to `dp` depending on the values of `j` and `k`. In all cases, the function maintains the integrity of `dp` according to the specified conditions.***
