The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop, but since there is no loop in the provided context, it effectively has no impact on the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is an integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is an integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 3, `i` is equal to 0, and dp[1][m + 2][3] = dp[1][m + 1][3]**
