Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]` is updated to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][2]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp` remains unchanged.***
