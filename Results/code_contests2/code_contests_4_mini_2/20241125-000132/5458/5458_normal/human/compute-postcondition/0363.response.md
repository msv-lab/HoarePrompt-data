Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, and `dp` is a two-dimensional list initialized with zeros of size (2, m + 2) and (s + 1) for each inner list. The loop will execute exactly `s` times, with `k` taking values from 1 up to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then the `dp` array remains unchanged for that `k`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The loop does not execute if `s` is less than 1, in which case `dp` remains unchanged and both `i` and `j` retain their initial values.**
