Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 2 to 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is updated from `dp[1][2][3]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is updated using the value from `dp[0][2][0]` and the modulo operation with `mod`. In all cases, the values of `dp` are modified according to the conditions specified.***
