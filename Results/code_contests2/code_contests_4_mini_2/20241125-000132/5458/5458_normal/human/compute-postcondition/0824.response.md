According to the code, the loop depends on the value of `s`. The loop will execute for `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and since `s` is between 1 and 3000, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4. Therefore, `k` needs to be adjusted to 4.

State: **`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 2, `k` is 4, `i` is 0**
