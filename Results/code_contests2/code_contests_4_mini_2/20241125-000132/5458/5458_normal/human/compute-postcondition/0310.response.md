Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to 1. There is no change to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`, but the values of `s`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.***
