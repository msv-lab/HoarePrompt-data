According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will increment to 2. Therefore, `s` must be at least 2 to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 2**
