Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) and (s + 1), and if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the next iteration of the loop is continued. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute any operations related to the `if` statement and moves on accordingly.
