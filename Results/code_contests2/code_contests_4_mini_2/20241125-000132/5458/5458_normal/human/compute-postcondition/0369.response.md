Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, and if `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than 1, the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
