According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the variable `s`. The loop runs for `k` from 1 to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3, and `s` must still be at least 3 to ensure that the loop can continue executing.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `k` is incremented to 3.
2. `s` must be at least 3 (to allow the loop to continue).

State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and `j` is `m + 1`.**
