The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Thus, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the state of the program indicates that we are continuing the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 2 and 2001, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
