The code assigns the value `1` to the `dp` array at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `0`, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to `3`, and `k` is `3`. 

Calculating the indices:
- `i + 1` equals `0 + 1`, which is `1`.
- The expression `1 & 1` equals `1`, so the first index becomes `1`.
- `j + 1` will be `m + 1 + 1`, which is `m + 2` (the exact value of `m` is unknown).
- The last index remains `k`, which is `3`.

Thus, the code modifies the `dp` array at the index `[1][m + 2][3]`, setting its value to `1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][m + 2][3]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][m + 2][3]` is set to 1**
