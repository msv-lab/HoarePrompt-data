The code snippet `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` affects the variable `dp` at the indices determined by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. **Calculation of indices:**
   - `i + 1 & 1`: The expression `i + 1` takes the value of `i` (which is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`) and adds 1 to it. The result will be either 1 (if `i` is 0) or 2 (if `i` is 1). The bitwise AND operation with `1` will yield `1` if `i` is 0 (resulting in `1 & 1 = 1`), and it will yield `0` if `i` is 1 (resulting in `2 & 1 = 0`).
   - `j + 1`: Since `j` is always 1, `j + 1` will always yield `2`.
   - `k`: The value of `k` is 2.

2. **Possible final indices:**
   - If `i` is 0, the indices accessed would be `dp[1][2][2]`.
   - If `i` is 1, the indices accessed would be `dp[0][2][2]`.

3. **Impact on the state:**
   - The value at the computed index in the `dp` array is set to `1`.

Since the actual values of `dp` are not specified in the initial state, the output state will mention the changes in terms of the indices accessed.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
