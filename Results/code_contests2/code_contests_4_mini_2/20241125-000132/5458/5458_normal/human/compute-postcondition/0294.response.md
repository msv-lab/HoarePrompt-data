The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this context, the values of the variables do not change due to the `continue` statement, but it indicates that the loop will continue its execution from the next iteration.

The relevant variables are:
- `s` is at least 1
- `n` is at least 4
- `m` is at least 3
- `i` is not equal to 0
- `j` is 3
- `k` is 1
- `j` is greater than `k`

Since there are no changes to the variable states and the code does not alter any values, the output state reflects the current values of the variables and the action taken.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
