Postcondition: ***If `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and adding the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. In any case, the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged during the execution of the block.***
