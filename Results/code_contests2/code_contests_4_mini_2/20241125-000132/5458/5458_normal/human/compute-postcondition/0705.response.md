The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and the dp array remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the fact that we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is 3001, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
