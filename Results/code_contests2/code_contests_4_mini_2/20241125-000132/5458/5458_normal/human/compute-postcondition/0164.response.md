The code contains a `continue` statement, which does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the loop that the code resides in. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged. 

The output state is: `n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
