Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, which may not yield a valid result if `k - j` is negative. All scenarios correctly reflect the state of `dp` under specified conditions while considering potential edge cases for index access.***
