Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is incremented by 1 and is now greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][3]`. For the case where `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is computed using the modulo operation on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][3]` and the sum of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. This ensures all paths are covered, including edge cases where `j` is equal to `k`.***
