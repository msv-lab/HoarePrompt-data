The initial state is given as follows: `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. 

1. First, we determine the value of `j`. Since `j` is `m + 1`, it will depend on the value of `m`. However, the specific value of `m` is not provided, so we denote `j` as `m + 1`.

2. The condition checks if `j` is greater than `k`. Given that `k` is 2, we have:
   - If `j > 2`, the statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` will be executed.
   - If `j <= 2`, no changes will be made to `dp`.

3. Since we do not have a specific value for `m`, we can't definitively determine whether `j` is greater than or less than/equal to `k`. Therefore, the impact on `dp` remains uncertain without knowing `m`.

Consequently, the output state must reflect that there is no change to `dp` and remains contingent on the value of `m`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and no changes are made to `dp`.**
