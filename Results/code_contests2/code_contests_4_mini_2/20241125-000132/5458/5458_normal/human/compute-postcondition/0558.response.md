The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and the loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
