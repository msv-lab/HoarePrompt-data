Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is an integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is an integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous state of `dp[i & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, ensuring appropriate modulo operations are applied. This accounts for all edge cases where `j` equals `k` or is less than `k`, reflecting changes in the `dp` array accordingly.***
