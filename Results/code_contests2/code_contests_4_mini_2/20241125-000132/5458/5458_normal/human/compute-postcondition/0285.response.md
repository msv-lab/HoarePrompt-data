According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for `j` taking values from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 3, and `j` is currently 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 3, and `j` must be incremented to 3 for the next iteration. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` must change from 2 to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted as `s`, `n`, `m`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is defined**
