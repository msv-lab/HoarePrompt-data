The command `continue` does not alter the values of any variables. It simply causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp[1][2][3]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and dp[1][2][3] is assigned the value of dp[1][1][3].**
