Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than 1, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remain unchanged as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration without modifying any of the variables. If `j` is less than or equal to 1, the program does not execute the if block, and the values of the variables remain as defined in the precondition.***
