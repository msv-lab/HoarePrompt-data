Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is not updated as the condition is not satisfied; thus, the state remains unchanged.**
