Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to the state of the `dp` array. If `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed based on the values from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, with the results being taken modulo `mod`.***
