To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the given conditions and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

1. The loop iterates over `k` in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. The variable `k` starts from `1` and will go up to, but not including, `s + 1`. 
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to `3`.
3. The value of `s` must also support this increment; since `s` is within the range of `2 to 3000`, `s` being at least `2` is sufficient for `k` to reach `3`.

Based on this analysis, the following adjustments are needed:

- `k` must be updated to `3` to allow the loop to execute one more time.

No other state variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`) need to be adjusted since they do not directly affect the loop condition for `k`.

Final state adjustment:
State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 2 to 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3**
