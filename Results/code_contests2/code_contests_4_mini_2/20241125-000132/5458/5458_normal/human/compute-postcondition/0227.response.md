Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is greater than 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds without executing the statements within the if block.***
