According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1, since it iterates from 1 to `s`. Given that `n`, `m`, and `s` are user-defined with `s` being greater than or equal to 1, we can confirm that the loop will execute. 

At the start of the loop, `k` will begin at 1, which is the first value in the range. The state of `j` being incremented by 1 (if it was less than `m`) does not affect the execution of this loop, but it should be noted as a potential state change that could happen before or during the loop.

Thus, to summarize, the necessary states for the loop to execute are:
- `s` must be at least 1 (which it is, as specified).
- `k` starts at 1.

State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
