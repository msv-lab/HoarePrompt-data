The code `continue` indicates that the program skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and moves to the next iteration. The values of `s`, `j`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that no modifications to these variables occur, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and `i` can be either 0 or non-zero; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
