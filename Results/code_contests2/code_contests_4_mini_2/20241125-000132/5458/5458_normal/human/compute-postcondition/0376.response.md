The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The specific previous values of the affected variables are not provided, but it's clear that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being modified based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

Since `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is changed, and the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is not known, we can only state that an update occurred.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, while other variables remain unchanged**.
