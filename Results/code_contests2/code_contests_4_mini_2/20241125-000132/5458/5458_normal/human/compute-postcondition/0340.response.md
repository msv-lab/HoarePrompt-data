Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a two-dimensional list initialized with zeros of size (2, m + 2) and (s + 1) for each inner list, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged as it is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues without any modifications to the variables.***
