The code contains a `continue` statement, which interrupts the current iteration of a loop and proceeds with the next iteration. However, since no loop structure is provided in the context, the values of the variables do not change. Therefore, the output state remains the same, indicating that we are continuing to the next iteration in the most immediate loop.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration in the most immediate loop.**
