The statement `continue` does not change any variable values or states. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration if applicable. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes have occurred to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
