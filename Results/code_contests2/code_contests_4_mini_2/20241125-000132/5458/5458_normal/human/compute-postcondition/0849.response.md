According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the condition defined in the loop. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Therefore, `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute another iteration. Hence, the states need to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3**
