Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 3 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is either 1 or greater than 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to 3, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. There are no changes made to the `dp` array if `j` is less than 3.***
