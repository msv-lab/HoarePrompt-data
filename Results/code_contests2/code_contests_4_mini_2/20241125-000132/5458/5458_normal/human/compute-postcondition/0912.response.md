The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific element in the multidimensional array `dp`. The indexes used in the assignment are derived from the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates the expression `i + 1` and applies a bitwise AND operation with `1`. Since `i` is less than `n^2 - 1` and `n` is at least `1`, `i + 1` can be either `1` (if `i` is `0`) or greater. Therefore, the result of `i + 1 & 1` will either be `0` or `1`, depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd.
- `j + 1` increases `j` (which is `2`) by `1`, so it will be `3`.
- `k` is `2` as given.

The output state will reflect the update made to the `dp` array and the values of other variables that are unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1, and dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2] is set to 1**
