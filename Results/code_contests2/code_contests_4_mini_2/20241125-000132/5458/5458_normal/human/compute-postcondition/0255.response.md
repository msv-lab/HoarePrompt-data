The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` is assigning the value `1` to a specific position in a multidimensional array or list named `dp`. The indices used for this assignment are determined by the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

- `i` is `0`, so `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1`, which equals `1`.
- `j` is `2`, so `j + 1` results in `3`.
- `k` is `1`.

Thus, the assignment specifically affects `dp[1][3][1]`, setting this position to `1`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged as this statement only updates the `dp` array.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
