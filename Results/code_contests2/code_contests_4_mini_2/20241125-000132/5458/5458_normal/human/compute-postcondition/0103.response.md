Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is an integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is an integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than `k` (which is 3), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`.***
