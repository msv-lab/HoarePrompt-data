Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][2]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is computed based on the previous state `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][2] % mod` and the term `dp[i & 1][j][0] % mod`, thus reflecting the cumulative values based on the indices and conditions provided.***
