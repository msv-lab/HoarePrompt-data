Postcondition: ***Given `n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1, if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`, or based on the modulo operation involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` otherwise. The overall state of `dp` reflects these updates depending on the conditions evaluated.***
