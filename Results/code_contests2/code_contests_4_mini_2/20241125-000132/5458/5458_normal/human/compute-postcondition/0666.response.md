Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2D list filled with zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to the value of `dp[1][1][1]`. For other conditions when `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][2][1]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[1][1][1]` modulo `mod` and adds it to the value of `dp[0][1][0]` modulo `mod`. In all cases, `dp` may have been modified based on the conditions met, while the values of `n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
