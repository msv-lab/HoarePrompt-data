The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop context is provided in the initial state, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop is skipped without any changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 2, `i` is equal to 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is updated to `dp[1][j][2]`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
