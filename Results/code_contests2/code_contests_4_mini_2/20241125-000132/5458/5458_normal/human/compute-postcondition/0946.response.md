The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves assigning the value `1` to a specific index of a multi-dimensional array `dp`. 

- The index `i + 1 & 1` computes the value based on the current value of `i`. If `i` is `0`, then `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` is `1`. If `i` is non-zero (and assuming it is `1` for this context), then `i + 1` would be `2`, and `2 & 1` is `0`. Therefore, the index will be either `0` or `1` based on `i`.
- The index `j + 1` uses the value of `j`, which is `m + 1`. Since `m` is not defined in the initial state, `j + 1` will be at least `m + 2`.
- The index `k` is `2`, which is constant.

Given that `s` is at least `2`, there are no direct changes to `s`, and `k` remains `2`. The assignment of `1` to the `dp` array will not affect the values of `s`, `j`, `k`, or `i`, but it modifies the contents of `dp`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, `i` can be either 0 or non-zero, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**.
