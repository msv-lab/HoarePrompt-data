Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and `j` is `m + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, this condition is not satisfied, and the program does not update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the if statement. Additionally, all updates to `dp` respect the boundaries set by `n`, `m`, and the conditions on `j` and `k`.***
