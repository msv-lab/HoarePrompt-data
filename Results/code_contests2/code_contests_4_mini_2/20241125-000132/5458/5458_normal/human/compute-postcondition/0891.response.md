Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no updates are made to the `dp` array.***
