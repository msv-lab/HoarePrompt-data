Output State: **`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`. No changes are made if `j` is less than or equal to `k`.**
