The statement assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `i` can either be 0 or any value between 1 and `n-1`. The bitwise operation `& 1` will effectively toggle the first index between 0 and 1 based on whether `i + 1` is even or odd. The variable `j` is at least 2, so `j + 1` will be at least 3. The variable `k` is fixed at 2. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the assignment operation performed.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `n` is within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
