Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `i` can be either 0 or non-zero. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and also incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This condition handles all cases for `i`, `j`, and `k` based on the initial values and their relationships.***
