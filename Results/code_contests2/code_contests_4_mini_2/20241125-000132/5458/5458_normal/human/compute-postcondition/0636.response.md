Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. There is no effect on the variables if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
