According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `s + 1`. The current state shows that `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is non-negative, and `dp` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, at the start of the loop, `k` will start at 1.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `s` must be at least 1, and `k` should be initialized to 1 at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`i is 0, j is m + 1, s is greater than or equal to 1, dp remains unchanged, k is 1`**
