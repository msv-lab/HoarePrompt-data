The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` affects the `dp` array based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The current value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
2. The current value of `j` is 2, so `j + 1` evaluates to `3`.
3. The current value of `k` is 2, so `k - j` evaluates to `2 - 2`, which is `0`.
4. The expression accesses `dp[0][2][2]`, and the operation is performed modulo `mod`, but `mod` is not specified.

Thus, the line updates `dp[1][3][2]` by adding `dp[0][2][0] % mod` to its current value. The other variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

The output reflects the unchanged values of these variables and the update to `dp[1][3][2]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 2 to 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[0][2][0] % mod`**
