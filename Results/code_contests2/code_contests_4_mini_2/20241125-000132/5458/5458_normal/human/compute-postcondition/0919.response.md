Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The overall state of `dp` is updated based on these conditions.***
