According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, so for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. The states of `j`, `i`, and `m` do not affect the execution of the loop directly but indicate the context in which the loop operates.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that:
1. `s` is at least 1, which allows the loop to start.
2. `k` should start at 1, which is the initial value for the loop variable.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `s` is at least 1,
- `k` is 1,
- `j` is 2,
- `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`,
- `m` is greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2**
