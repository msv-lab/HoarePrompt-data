According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `m`. The loop is designed to iterate from 1 to `m` (inclusive). The last executed iteration would have `j` equal to `m`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be incremented, allowing `j` to take the next value.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m`, indicating the loop cannot execute again unless `m` is increased. Additionally, if we want to define the next state, `j` needs to be adjusted to `m + 1` for the loop to execute another time.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is `m + 1`**
