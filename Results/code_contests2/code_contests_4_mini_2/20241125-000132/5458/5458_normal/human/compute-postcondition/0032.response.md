Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, and `k` is greater than `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to the `dp` array.***
