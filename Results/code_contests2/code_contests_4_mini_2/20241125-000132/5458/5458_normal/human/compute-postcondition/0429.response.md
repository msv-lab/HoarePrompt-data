Postcondition: ***If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than 3, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][3]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][3 - j] % mod`. In all cases, `n` is within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and `j` is always `m + 1`.***
