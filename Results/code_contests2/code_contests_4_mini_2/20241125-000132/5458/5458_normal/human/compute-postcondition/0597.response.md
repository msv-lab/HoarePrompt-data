According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to 3, and since `s` is at least 2, it must also be ensured that `s` is at least 3 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
