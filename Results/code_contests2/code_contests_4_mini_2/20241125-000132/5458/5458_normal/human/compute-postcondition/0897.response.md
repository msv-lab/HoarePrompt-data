According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` remains 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to 1, indicating that the loop has one iteration left for `j`. 

Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 2, allowing `j` to be incremented to 2 for the next iteration. 

No other states need to be adjusted, as `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1 (which allows the loop to have executed), and `dp` can remain unchanged as we are concerned with the iteration of `j`.

State: **`if s is at least 1 then dp[i + 1 & 1][2][k]` is updated according to the conditions set in the loop for each k from 1 to s, `j` is 2, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2**
