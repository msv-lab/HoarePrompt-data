Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 2 to 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made and the loop continues without any operation.***
