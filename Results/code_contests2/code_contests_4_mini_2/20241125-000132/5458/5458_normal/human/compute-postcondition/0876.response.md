Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and it also includes the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, while ensuring that the bounds of `k` are respected.***
