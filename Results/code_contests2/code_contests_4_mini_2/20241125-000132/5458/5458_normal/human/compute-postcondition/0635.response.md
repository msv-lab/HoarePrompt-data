The `continue` statement does not change any values of the variables. It causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since there's no indication of any loop context in the given state, the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

The output state is: `n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
