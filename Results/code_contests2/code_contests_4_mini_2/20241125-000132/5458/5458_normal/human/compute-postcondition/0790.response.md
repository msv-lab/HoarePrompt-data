According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` in relation to `s`. The loop is designed to run for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` should be updated to 4. Additionally, since `k` must remain less than or equal to `s`, we also need to ensure that `s` is at least 4.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 4**
