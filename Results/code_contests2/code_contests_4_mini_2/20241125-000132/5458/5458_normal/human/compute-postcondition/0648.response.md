The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned from the input, which is processed by `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, and `s` is between 1 and 3000, the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `s` will now be determined by the input provided. The variable `dp` remains unchanged. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the ranges of `n`, `m`, and `s`, while indicating that `dp` is unchanged. The specific values of `n`, `m`, and `s` cannot be determined without input, so they remain in their defined ranges.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, and `dp` remains unchanged**.
