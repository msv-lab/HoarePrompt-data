Postcondition: ***`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the `dp` structure. If `i` is between 4 and 7, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1, the state of the `dp` structure is updated based on the calculations performed, specifically by using values from previous states of the `dp` array, ensuring modular arithmetic is applied.***
