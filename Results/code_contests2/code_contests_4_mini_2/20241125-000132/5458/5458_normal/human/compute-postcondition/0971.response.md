Output State: **`if n, m, s are all non-zero integers within their respective ranges, then dp` is computed based on the nested loops; output is the value at dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod. If n, m, s are all 0, the loop terminates without any computation; the values of n, m, s remain unchanged and no output is produced. If n is less than 1 or greater than 7, m is less than 1 or greater than 2000, or s is less than 1 or greater than 3000, the values remain unchanged and the loop will not start.**
