The assignment affects the variable `dp`, specifically the element at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value assigned to this element is computed from the existing value at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and the conditions for `j` and `k` do not directly affect the computation of `dp`. Therefore, the output state is focused on the computation performed on `dp`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is 3001, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
