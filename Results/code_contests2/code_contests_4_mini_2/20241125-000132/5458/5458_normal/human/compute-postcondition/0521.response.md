The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables or affect their state, but it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is at least `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
