Postcondition: ***`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues in the most internal loop and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to match `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. There is no else part in the code.***
