Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is equal to `s` and is between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no modification to `dp`.***
