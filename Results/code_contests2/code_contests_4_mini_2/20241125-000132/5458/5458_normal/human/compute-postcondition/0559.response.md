Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute any operation within the if statement, and the state of the program remains unchanged.***
