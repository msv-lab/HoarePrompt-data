According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. Given the initial state where `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, this condition is satisfied. 

The loop will start with `k` equal to 1 and will iterate up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` will have gone through the values from 1 to `s`. 

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as `s` is already greater than or equal to 1, and `k` will start from 1.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
