The code `continue` does not change the values of the variables, but it causes the program to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 2, `n` is within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
