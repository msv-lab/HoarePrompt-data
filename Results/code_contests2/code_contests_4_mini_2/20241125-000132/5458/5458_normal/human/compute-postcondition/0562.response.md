Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, while if `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` array. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values, specifically from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, with all updates performed modulo `mod`.***
