Postcondition: ***`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 3, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without further changes to the state. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no actions are taken since there is no else part defined.***
