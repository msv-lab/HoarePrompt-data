Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[1][m + 2][3]` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k` in the else part, `dp[1][m + 2][3]` is updated to `dp[1][m + 2][3]` plus `dp[1][m + 1][3 - (m + 1)] % mod`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the state of the program remains unchanged for `dp[1][m + 2][3]`. All updates are subject to the modulo operation with `mod`.***
