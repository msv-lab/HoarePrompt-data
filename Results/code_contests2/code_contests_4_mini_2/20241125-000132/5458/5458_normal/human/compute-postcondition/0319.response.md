According to the code, the loop will execute if the value of `j` is less than or equal to `m`. The loop starts with `j` initialized at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it exceeds `m`. 

Since it's stated that the loop can execute again if `s` is at least 1, we need to adjust for the next iteration. 

Given that the loop variable `j` is currently at a value less than or equal to `m`, we need to ensure that after the previous iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to be `j + 1`.

Also, we need to ensure that `m` is still valid; however, since there are no constraints on `m` given, we do not change it.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect this increment in `j`.

State: **`if s is at least 1 then dp array is updated based on the values of i, j + 1, and k; if s is less than 1 the loop does not execute and the dp array remains unchanged, j is now j + 1`**
