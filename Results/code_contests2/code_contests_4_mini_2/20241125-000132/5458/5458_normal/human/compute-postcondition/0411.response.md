Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `i` is an integer where if `i` is 0 and `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. All updates to `dp` respect the boundaries set by `n`, `m`, and the conditions on `j` and `k`.***
