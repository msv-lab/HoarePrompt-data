Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and `k` will take values from 1 to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated with contributions from both `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The loop executes `s` times when `s` is at least 1. If `s` is 0 or negative (although not within given constraints), the loop does not execute, and `j` remains incremented only once before the loop starts.**
