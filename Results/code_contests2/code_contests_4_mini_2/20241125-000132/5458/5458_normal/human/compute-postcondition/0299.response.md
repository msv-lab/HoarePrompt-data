According to the code, the for loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `s` is at least 1, `s` must be adjusted to ensure that it is at least 2 to allow the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` should be at least 2 to allow for `k` to take the value of 2.
- `k` should be updated to 2 for the next iteration of the loop.

No other states need to be adjusted since `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected by the loop iteration.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 2**
