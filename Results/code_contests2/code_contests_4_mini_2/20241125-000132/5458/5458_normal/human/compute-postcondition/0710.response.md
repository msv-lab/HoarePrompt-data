According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The loop variable `k` starts at 1 and increments by 1 on each iteration until it reaches `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:
- `n` is between 1 and 7,
- `m` is between 1 and 2000,
- `s` is 3001,
- `dp` is a modified 2D list,
- `k` is currently at its maximum value of 3001 (since the loop goes from 1 to `s + 1`, where `s = 3001`).

Since the loop is supposed to run while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to 3001. However, at the end of the last iteration, `k` has reached 3001, which means it cannot execute again.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `k`, which needs to be less than or equal to 3000 for the loop to run one more time.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is 3001, `dp` is a modified 2D list, `k` is 3000**
