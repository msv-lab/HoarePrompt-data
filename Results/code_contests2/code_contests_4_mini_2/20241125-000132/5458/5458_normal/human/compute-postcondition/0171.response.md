Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than 2 and within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program assigns the value 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]`. There are no changes made to the state of `dp` if `j` is less than `k`.***
