Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to the `dp` array. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed using the values from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, with both calculations taken modulo `mod`. In all cases, the array `dp` is modified only according to the conditions specified for `j` relative to `k`.***
