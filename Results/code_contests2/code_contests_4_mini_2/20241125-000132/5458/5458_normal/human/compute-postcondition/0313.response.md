Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][2]` while continuing in the loop. There is no action taken if `j` is not greater than `k`, as there is no else part.***
