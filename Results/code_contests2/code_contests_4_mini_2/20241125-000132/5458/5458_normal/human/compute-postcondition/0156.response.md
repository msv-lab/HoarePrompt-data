Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution continues in the innermost loop or block of code. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no change to the state of `dp` and the execution proceeds accordingly.***
