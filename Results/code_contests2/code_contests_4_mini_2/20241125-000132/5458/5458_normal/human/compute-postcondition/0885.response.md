Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `m` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to 1 while `k` is equal to 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to match `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, both taken modulo `mod`.***
