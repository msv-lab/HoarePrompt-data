Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is either 1 or greater than 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1, indicating that this specific state has been activated. If `j` is less than 2, the state of `dp` remains unchanged, ensuring that the program handles this boundary case effectively.***
