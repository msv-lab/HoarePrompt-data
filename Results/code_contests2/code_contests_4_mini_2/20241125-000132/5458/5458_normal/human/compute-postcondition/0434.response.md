According to the code provided, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n ** 2` times. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is still within the bounds of the loop, so to allow for one more execution, `i` must be incremented to stay within the range of `n ** 2`.

Assuming `i` was `n ** 2 - 1` at the end of the last iteration, `n` would need to be adjusted accordingly to allow `i` to increase by 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

1. `i` must be incremented by 1.
2. `n` must be adjusted to ensure that `n ** 2` is at least equal to the new value of `i + 1`.

Considering the maximum value of `n` is 7, if `i` was at its maximum value of `n ** 2 - 1` (which is 48 when `n` is 7), `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is at least 49. This indicates that `n` cannot be more than 7, hence the maximum permissible value of `n` must be 7.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need:

State: **`n` is 7, `i` is `n ** 2 - 1`** (which is 48).
