Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the `dp` array is updated based on the values from the previous state of the array, and the loop continues to the next iteration. There is no change to `dp` or the state of the program if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
