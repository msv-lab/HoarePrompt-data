The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
