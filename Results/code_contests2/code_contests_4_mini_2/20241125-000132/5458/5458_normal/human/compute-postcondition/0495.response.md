The code snippet modifies a multidimensional array `dp` based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The current values are `i = 0`, `j = 2`, and `k = 3`. 

1. Calculate `i + 1 & 1`: 
   - `i + 1` is `0 + 1` which equals `1`.
   - `1 & 1` (bitwise AND) results in `1`.

2. The original state of the array `dp` is indexed as follows:
   - `dp[1][j + 1][k]` translates to `dp[1][3][3]` (since `j + 1` is `2 + 1` which equals `3`).
   - `dp[1][j][k]` translates to `dp[1][2][3]`.

3. The statement assigns the value at `dp[1][2][3]` to `dp[1][3][3]`.

The operation does not affect the other initial values. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`.**
