Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program will not perform any operations in this fragment.***
