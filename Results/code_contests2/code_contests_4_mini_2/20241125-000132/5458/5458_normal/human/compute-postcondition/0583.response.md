The execution of the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it will skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop in which it is contained (if it is inside a loop). Therefore, the values of the variables remain as they are, and we only note that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is 7, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
