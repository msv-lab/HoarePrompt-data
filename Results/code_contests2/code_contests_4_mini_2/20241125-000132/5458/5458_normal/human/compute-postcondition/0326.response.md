The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7; `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000; `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000; `dp` remains unchanged; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
