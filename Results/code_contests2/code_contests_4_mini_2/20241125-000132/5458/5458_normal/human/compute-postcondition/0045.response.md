The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a position in a 3D array `dp`. Specifically, it accesses the array at indices calculated from the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Given that `i` is `0`, `j` is a user-defined integer within the range of `1 to 7`, and `k` is `1`, we can calculate the indices as follows:
- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- `j + 1` will be within the range of `2 to 8` (since `j` ranges from `1 to 7`).
- `k` is `1`.

Thus, the specific position being modified in the array is `dp[1][j + 1][1]`.

The statement updates `dp[1][j + 1][1]` to `1`, but does not affect the state of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, or `k`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is j + 1 and is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1**.
