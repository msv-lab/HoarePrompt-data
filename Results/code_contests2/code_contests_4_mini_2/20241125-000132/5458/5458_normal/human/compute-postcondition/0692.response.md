Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2D list that may have been modified, `j` is equal to `m`, `i` is 0, and `k` is 1. If `j` (which is equal to `m`) is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, indicating that the value at that position in the 2D list has been modified. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes occur to the `dp` list.***
