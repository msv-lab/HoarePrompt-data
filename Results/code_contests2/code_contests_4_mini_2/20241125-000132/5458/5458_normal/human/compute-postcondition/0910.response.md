Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then there is no change to the `dp` array. If `i` is greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by setting it to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`, or by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `j` is less than or equal to `k`. In all cases, the updates to the `dp` array are performed modulo `mod`.***
