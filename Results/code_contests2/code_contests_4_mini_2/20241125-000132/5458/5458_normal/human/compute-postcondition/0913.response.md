Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, specifically `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`.***
