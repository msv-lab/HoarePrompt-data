Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]` is updated using the modulus operation on `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]` and includes a term derived from `dp[i & 1][2][1]`. In all cases, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain constant as described in the precondition.***
