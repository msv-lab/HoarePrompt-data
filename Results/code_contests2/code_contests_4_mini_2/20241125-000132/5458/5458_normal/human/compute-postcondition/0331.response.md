According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1. Given that `n`, `m`, and `s` are all user-defined integers, the states need to reflect that `s` is greater than or equal to 1. 

The variable `k` will start at 1 and increment by 1 until it reaches `s`. Before the loop starts, `k` is not yet initialized because the loop has not begun executing, so `k` will be 1 at the first iteration.

To summarize, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `s` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `k` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a two-dimensional list initialized with zeros of size (2, m + 2) and (s + 1) for each inner list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
