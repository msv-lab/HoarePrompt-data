The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
