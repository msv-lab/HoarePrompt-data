Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is an integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is an integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is updated to `dp[1][j][2]` and the current iteration is skipped. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is updated to `dp[1][j][2] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`. All modifications of the `dp` array depend on the comparisons involving `j` and `k`, with special conditions applied based on the values of `j` relative to `k`.***
