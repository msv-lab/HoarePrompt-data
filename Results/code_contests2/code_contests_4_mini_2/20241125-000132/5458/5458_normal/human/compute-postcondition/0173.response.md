The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than 2 and within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
