Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is 2 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is 2 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to the `dp` array. If `j` is 3 and is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][3][3]`. If `j` is 3 and is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][4][3]` is updated using `dp[0][3][0] % mod`.***
