Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][4][1]` is updated to `dp[1][3][1]`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][4][1]` is updated to `dp[1][3][1] % mod + dp[0][3][0] % mod`. In all cases, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged.***
