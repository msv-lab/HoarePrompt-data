The statement modifies the `dp` array based on the current indices calculated from `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

- `i` is 4, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0` (since `5 & 1` is `1` in binary).
- `j` is 1, so `j + 1` evaluates to `2`.
- `k` is 3, so `k - j` evaluates to `2`.

The expression modifies the `dp` array at index `[0][2][3]` by adding the value of `dp[1][1][2]` (which is `k - j`).

Since no specific values for `dp` are provided, we can't define specific changes to the `dp` array, but the operation itself does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, or `k`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and the `dp` array is modified at dp[0][2][3] by adding dp[1][1][2] % mod.**
