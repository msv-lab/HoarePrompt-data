The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `dp[1][3][2]` is updated with the value from `dp[1][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
