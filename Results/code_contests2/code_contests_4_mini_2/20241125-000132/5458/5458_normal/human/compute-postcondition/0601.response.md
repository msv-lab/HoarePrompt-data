The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is currently in. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
