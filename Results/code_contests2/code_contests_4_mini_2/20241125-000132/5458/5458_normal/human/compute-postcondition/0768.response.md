Postcondition: ***`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `i` is between 4 and 7, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, this condition does not execute, and the state of the program remains unchanged regarding the `dp` structure in this fragment.***
