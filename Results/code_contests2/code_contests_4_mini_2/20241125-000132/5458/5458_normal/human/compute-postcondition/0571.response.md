Postcondition: ***`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and adding the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This ensures all edge cases regarding the comparison between `j` and `k` are handled.***
