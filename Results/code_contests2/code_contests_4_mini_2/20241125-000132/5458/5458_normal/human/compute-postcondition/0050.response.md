The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but rather continues to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the output state will reflect that no variables have been modified, but we are skipping to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is j + 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
