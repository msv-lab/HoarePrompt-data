The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables have not changed as a result of the `continue`, but it indicates that we are moving to the next iteration of the most immediate loop. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
