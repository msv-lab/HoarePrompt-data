According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `s` is at least 2, it ensures that the loop can still execute again since `s + 1` will be at least 3, allowing `k` to take on the value of 3.

No other states need to be adjusted as the other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute again in this context.

State: **`n` is 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 3**
