The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modifies the `dp` variable, specifically at the index calculated by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. 

The value of `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, and `j` is 1. Since `k` is 2, we can observe the following:

- The expression `i + 1 & 1` calculates the value of the first index based on `i`. Given the condition that `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, we can say that `i + 1` is at least 1 (since `i` must be non-negative). The result of `i + 1 & 1` will yield either 0 or 1, depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd.
- The value of `j + 1` results in 2, since `j` is 1.
- The value of `k` remains 2.

Thus, the code effectively assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]`. The state of `dp` is modified, but other variables (`i`, `j`, `s`, `m`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than `n^2 - 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]` to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][2]`.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]` to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][2]**
