The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value from the right-hand side to the left-hand side. Here, `i + 1 & 1` computes the bitwise AND operation, which will result in either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd. The values of `j + 1` and `k` are utilized as indices in the `dp` array.

Since there are no specific values provided for `dp` and the operation does not change the state of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, or `k`, the output will reflect the unchanged state while noting that the assignment has occurred.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 3 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is either 1 or greater than 1, `k` is 3, and the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
