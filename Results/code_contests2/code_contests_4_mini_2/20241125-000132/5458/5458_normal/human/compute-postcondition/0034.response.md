The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since the initial state does not provide any specifics about the loop or the current index values, we can only conclude that the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `k` is greater than `s + 1`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
