Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not perform any action and the loop proceeds with the current values of `s`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
