The code snippet `continue` does not change the values of any variables directly but is used to skip the current iteration of a loop. Given the context, we are likely within a loop, and the `continue` statement causes the program to jump to the next iteration without executing any further code in the current iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop continues without any modifications to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, and the loop continues without changes to the variables.**
