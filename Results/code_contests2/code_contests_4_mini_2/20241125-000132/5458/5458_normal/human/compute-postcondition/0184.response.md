The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves array indexing with the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`.
2. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to `1` (bitwise AND operation).
3. The value of `j` is at least `2`, so `j + 1` is at least `3`.
4. The value of `k` is `1`.

Thus, the indexing resolves to `dp[1][j + 1][1]`, where `j + 1` is at least `3`. 

The assignment `dp[1][j + 1][1] = 1` sets the value at this specific index to `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1.**
