Postcondition: ***`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the operation modifies `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no modification to `dp`. The value of `i` remains undefined, and the operation is contingent on the condition being satisfied.***
