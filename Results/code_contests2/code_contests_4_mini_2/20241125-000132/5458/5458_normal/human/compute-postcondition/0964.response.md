Output State: **If `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute up to `s` times with `k` taking values from 1 to `s`. After executing the loop, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][k]` will be set to 1. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `s` is 0 or lower, or if `j` is less than 1, then the loop does not execute and `dp` remains unchanged.**
