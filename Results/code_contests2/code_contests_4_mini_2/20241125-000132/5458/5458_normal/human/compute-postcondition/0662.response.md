The `continue` statement does not change any values of the variables but causes the program to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Given that `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and the state of `dp` is previously defined, the output state remains unchanged except for indicating that the control has moved to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2D list filled with zeros, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
