Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, and `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `dp`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `s` is at least 1, the loop executes up to `s` times, incrementing `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` retains its previous value. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the sum of `dp[1][j][k]` and `dp[0][j][k - j]`, both taken modulo `mod`. The loop ensures proper handling of the relationship between `i`, `j`, `k`, and the `dp` array.**
