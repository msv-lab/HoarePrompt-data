The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the loop will continue to the next iteration without executing any subsequent code within the loop body for the current iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, indicating that we are continuing in the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `i` is between 4 and 7, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue in the loop.**
