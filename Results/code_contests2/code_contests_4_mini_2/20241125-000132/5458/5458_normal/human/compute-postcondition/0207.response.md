The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `s`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state indicates that we break out of the current loop iteration.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `n` is within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
