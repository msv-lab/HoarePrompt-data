The given code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in this operation, and their values are affected as follows:

- `i` is between 4 and 7, so `i + 1` can be either 5, 6, or 7.
- The expression `i + 1 & 1` results in either 1 or 0, depending on the parity of `i + 1`:
  - If `i + 1` is even (6), then `i + 1 & 1` is 0.
  - If `i + 1` is odd (5 or 7), then `i + 1 & 1` is 1.
- `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2.
- `k` is 1, which is unchanged.

The assignment modifies the `dp` array, but without the specific structure or values of `dp`, we can only describe the changes in the indices affected by `i`, `j`, and `k`.

The output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the assignment operation. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is between 4 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `i` is between 4 and 7, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we assigned dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]**
