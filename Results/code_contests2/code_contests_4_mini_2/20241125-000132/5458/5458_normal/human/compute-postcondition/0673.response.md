The statement updates the `dp` array based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The modulus operation is applied to the value on the right side of the assignment, which is taken from the `dp` array. Since `j` is not greater than `k`, the control proceeds without modifying `dp`.

Therefore, since no changes are made to `dp`, and the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` are still within their defined ranges, the output state reflects the unchanged values of all variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2D list filled with zeros, and `k` is `s + 1`.**
