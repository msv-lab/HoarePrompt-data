Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 2 to 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][3][2]` is updated to `dp[1][2][2]`, while if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[0][2][0] % mod` to it. This handles all conditions for the values of `j` and `k` as well as the state of `dp` based on the value of `i`.***
