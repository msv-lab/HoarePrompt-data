Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds without any modifications to the current state.***
