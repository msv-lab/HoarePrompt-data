According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate `n ** 2` times. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, meaning that the loop has executed 4 times. Since the loop is defined to run for `i` in the range of `n ** 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted so that `n ** 2` is at least 5.

Given that `n` is at least 4, we calculate `n ** 2` which is at least 16. Therefore, it is sufficient for `n` to remain at least 4. Since `i` is currently 4, we increment `i` to 5 for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted as `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` do not affect the execution of this specific loop.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 5, `j` will take values from 1 to `m`, and `k` will take values from 1 to `s`**
