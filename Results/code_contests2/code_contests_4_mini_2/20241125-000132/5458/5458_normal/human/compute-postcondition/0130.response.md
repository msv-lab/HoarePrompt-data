The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, or `k`, but it affects the control flow by continuing to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state is that the variables remain unchanged, and the iteration of the loop continues.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `j` is either 1 or greater than 1, `k` is 2, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
