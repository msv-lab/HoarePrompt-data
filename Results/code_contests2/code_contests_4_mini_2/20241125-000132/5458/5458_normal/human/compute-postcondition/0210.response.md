Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `n` is within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the condition of `j` with respect to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
