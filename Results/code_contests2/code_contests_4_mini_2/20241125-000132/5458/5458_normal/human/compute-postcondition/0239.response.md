Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is 1, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is set to the value of `dp[1][1][2]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is updated with the value of `dp[1][1][2]` modulo `mod`, and also includes the addition of `dp[0][1][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The conditions regarding the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain satisfied throughout the execution.***
