The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the element of a 3-dimensional array `dp` at the indices calculated from `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to `1` if `i` is `0` (because `0 + 1 = 1` and `1 & 1 = 1`), and will evaluate to `0` if `i` had been any other value, but since `i` is `0`, it will be `1`.
2. `j + 1` represents the increment of `j` by `1`. Since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, we cannot determine its exact value, but it will be at least `k + 1`.
3. `k` is equal to `s` and is between `1` and `3000`.

The assignment will affect only the `dp` array, while the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between `1` and `7`, `m` is between `1` and `2000`, `s` is between `1` and `3000`, `k` is between `1` and `3000`, `i` is `0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `k` is between 1 and 3000, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
