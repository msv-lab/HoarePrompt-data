Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a two-dimensional list initialized with zeros of size (2, m + 2) and (s + 1) for each inner list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the program does not modify `dp`.***
