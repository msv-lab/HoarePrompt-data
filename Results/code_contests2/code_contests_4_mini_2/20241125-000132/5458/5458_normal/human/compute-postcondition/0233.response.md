Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, `i` is 4, `j` is 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is set to 1. There is no change to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`, but the preconditions remain satisfied.***
