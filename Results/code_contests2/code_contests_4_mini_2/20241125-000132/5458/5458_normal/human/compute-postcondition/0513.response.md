Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is `m + 1` and greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. There is no else part to consider since the condition is strictly focused on when `j` exceeds `k`.***
