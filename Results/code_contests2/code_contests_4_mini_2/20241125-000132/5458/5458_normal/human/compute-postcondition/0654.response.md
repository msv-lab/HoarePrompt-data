According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Since `s` is between 1 and 3000, the loop will execute if `s` is at least 1. The initial value of `k` is not defined before the loop starts, but it will start at 1 during the first iteration. 

Since `i` and `j` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop, they can remain unchanged. However, we need to ensure `k` starts at 1.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are that `k` starts at 1 during the first iteration of the loop, and `s` must be at least 1 for the loop to be executed.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is between 1 and 3000, `dp` is initialized as a 2D list filled with zeros, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
