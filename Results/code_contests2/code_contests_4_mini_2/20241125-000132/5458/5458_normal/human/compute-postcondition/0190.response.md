Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n-1`, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration without executing any further code in the current iteration. No changes occur to the variables if `j` is not greater than `k`, as there is no else part present.***
