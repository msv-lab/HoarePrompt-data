Postcondition: ***Given `n` is 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][3][2]` is set to `dp[1][2][2]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][2]` is computed as the sum of `dp[1][2][2]` and `dp[0][2][k - j]`, with both being taken modulo `mod`.***
