According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `s` must be at least 1, as the loop iterates from 1 to `s + 1`. Given that `s` is within the range of 1 to 3000, it meets the requirement for the loop to execute. The variable `k` will start at 1 when the loop begins. The values of `n`, `m`, and `j` do not affect the execution of this loop directly.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are that `s` is within its defined range and `k` starts at 1.

State: **`n` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is a user-defined integer within the range of 2 to 2000, `s` is a user-defined integer within the range of 1 to 3000, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1**
