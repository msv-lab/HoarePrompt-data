According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of `1` to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `1`, and `s` is at least `1`, meaning the loop can execute again.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by `1`, which means `k` will be `2` in the next iteration. Since `s` is at least `1`, it can accommodate `k` being `2` as long as `s` is at least `2`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `s` should be adjusted to be at least `2` (which allows `k` to be `2`), and `k` should be updated to `2`.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `n` is within the range of 1 to 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, and `k` is 2.**
