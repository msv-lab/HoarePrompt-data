The function processes multiple datasets of integers `n`, `m`, and `s`, where the input continues until all three values are zero. For each dataset, it computes a value based on a dynamic programming approach and prints the result. The function does not return any value, instead, it outputs the computed value directly to the standard output. It handles inputs where `n`, `m`, and `s` can be non-zero integers within specified ranges and ensures the iteration stops when the input is `0 0 0`. The specifics of the computation involve a 3D list used to perform calculations, but no explicit details on the purpose of the computation are provided in the annotations.
