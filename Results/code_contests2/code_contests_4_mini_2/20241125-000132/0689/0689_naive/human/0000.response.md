To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it correctly identifies whether string S equals string T after a series of rotations.

The program provided is:
```python
s = raw_input()
t = raw_input()
print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code uses `raw_input()` to read the strings S and T. This is an appropriate way to read inputs in Python 2, but if we were to assume this is Python 3, it should be `input()`.
  
2. **Rotation Check**: The expression `any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))` generates all possible rotations of T by slicing and checking if any of those rotations equal S. 
   - `t[i:]` gives the substring from index `i` to the end of T.
   - `t[:i]` gives the substring from the start of T to index `i`.
   - The concatenation `t[i:] + t[:i]` effectively creates a rotation of T. 

3. **Output**: The program uses list indexing to print 'Yes' or 'No' based on whether any rotation matches S.

### Potential Issues:
- **Case Handling**: The program assumes that the input strings are always valid lowercase English letters and of equal length. However, it does not handle cases where the lengths of S and T might not be equal, even though the constraints guarantee this.
- **Performance**: The algorithm checks all rotations of T, which is O(n^2) in the worst case due to the slicing operation inside the loop. This may not be optimal but remains correct given the constraints (maximum length of 100).
  
### Test Cases:
- Given the examples in the problem description (like "kyoto" and "tokyo"), the function should return "Yes" or "No" correctly.
- An edge case to consider is if both strings are the same (e.g., `s = "aa"` and `t = "aa"`), which should return "Yes".

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to check for rotations of string T to see if it can equal string S. After considering the constraints and examining the program's operations, I canâ€™t find a potential case where it fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
