The function `func` accepts two parameters, `S` and `T`. Both `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and they have the same length, which is between 2 and 100 characters. The function processes these strings and produces an output. However, the specific output or behavior based on the relationship between `S` and `T` is not provided. Therefore, I can only confirm the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, S and T, both are strings of lowercase English letters with the same length between 2 and 100 characters.**
