Functionality: ** The function accepts two strings `s` and `t`, reads them from input, and checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t`. If `s` can be formed by any rotation of `t`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function assumes that both strings have the same length and consist of lowercase English letters, with lengths between 2 and 100 characters. There are no explicit checks for the input validity regarding the length or character constraints. **
