The variable `t` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which takes an input string from the user. The initial states of `S` and `T` remain unchanged, and `s` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state consists of the unchanged values of `S`, `T`, and the newly input value for `t`.

Output State: **`S` is a string, `T` is a string, `s` is a string, and `t` is an input string.**
