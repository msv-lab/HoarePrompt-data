To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we first need to analyze the logic of the program and how it handles the inputs according to the specified operations.

### Problem Description Recap:
- You are given two strings, S and T, consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The task is to determine if S can be made equal to T by performing a rotation operation multiple times.
- A rotation operation involves moving the last character of S to the front.

### Program Analysis:
The program is structured as follows:
```python
s = raw_input()
t = raw_input()
print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]
```

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - It reads two strings, `s` and `t`.
   
2. **Rotation Logic**:
   - The program checks if any of the rotations of `t` (achieved by slicing `t` at every index `i` and concatenating the two parts) matches `s`.
   - The rotation is done by generating `t[i:] + t[:i]` for all possible indices `i` from 0 to the length of `t`.

3. **Output**:
   - If any rotation matches `s`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness Check:
To determine if the program is correct, we need to consider edge cases and whether all potential scenarios are covered.

#### Edge Case Considerations:
1. **Same Strings**: 
   - If `s` is equal to `t`, the program should return "Yes".
   - This case is correctly handled since `t[0:]` concatenated with `t[:0]` will equal `t` itself.

2. **Different Lengths**:
   - The problem states that both strings are of the same length, so we do not need to check for different lengths.

3. **All Characters Same**:
   - If `s` and `t` are made up of the same repeated character (e.g., "aaaa" and "aaaa"), the program should return "Yes".
   - This case is also correctly handled, as any rotation will still result in the same string.

4. **No Possible Rotation Match**:
   - If `s` cannot be achieved by rotating `t`, the program should return "No".
   - For example, `s = "abc"` and `t = "def"`, the program will correctly return "No".

5. **Rotation Edge Cases**:
   - Consider `s = "ab"` and `t = "ba"`. The rotation of `t` gives "ab" which matches `s`, so the program should return "Yes".

### Final Thoughts:
After analyzing the rotations and various potential cases, the program appears to handle all scenarios as described in the problem statement. It correctly checks for all rotations of `t` and matches them against `s`. 

Thus, there is no case where the program fails to meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
