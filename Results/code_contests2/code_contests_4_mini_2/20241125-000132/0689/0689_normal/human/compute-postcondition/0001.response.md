The variable `t` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input string from the user. The lengths of `S` and `T` are between 2 and 100 and remain unchanged, while `s` is also an input string. Since `t` receives a new string value, the output state will reflect the unchanged state of `S`, `T`, and `s`, along with the newly assigned value of `t`.

Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100, `s` is an input string, `t` is an input string**
