The function `func` accepts two parameters: `S` and `T`. Both `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, with lengths between 2 and 100. Additionally, the lengths of `S` and `T` are equal (|S| = |T|). 

After executing the function body, the function processes these strings in such a way that it compares or manipulates them based on their contents. However, the specific output is not provided in the prompt.

Thus, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, S and T, which are strings of lowercase English letters with equal lengths between 2 and 100.**
