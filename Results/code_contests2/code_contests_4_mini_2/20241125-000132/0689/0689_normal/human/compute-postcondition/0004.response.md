Functionality: ** The function accepts two strings `s` and `t` as input, checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t`, and prints 'Yes' if it can or 'No' if it cannot. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the lengths of `s` and `t` are not equal, which is a necessary edge case since the problem requires both strings to have equal lengths.**
