To determine the output state after executing the provided Python code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables given the initial state.

The code snippet:
```
print['No', 'Yes'][any(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))]
```

1. **Understanding the variables**: 
   - `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `t` is an input string.

2. **Constructing the expression**: 
   - The expression `t[i:] + t[:i]` generates all possible rotations of the string `t` by taking a substring from position `i` to the end and appending the substring from the start to position `i`.
   - The `any()` function checks if any of these rotations equal the string `s`.

3. **Printing the result**: 
   - If any rotation of `t` matches `s`, the expression evaluates to `True`, and the code prints "Yes".
   - If no rotation matches, it evaluates to `False`, and it prints "No".

4. **Determining the output**: 
   - Since the actual values of `s` and `t` are not specified, we cannot determine the specific output ("Yes" or "No"). However, we can state that the result depends on whether `s` matches any rotation of `t`.

Therefore, the output state, reflecting the input strings and the result based on the evaluation, would be:

Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings, and the output is either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison**.
