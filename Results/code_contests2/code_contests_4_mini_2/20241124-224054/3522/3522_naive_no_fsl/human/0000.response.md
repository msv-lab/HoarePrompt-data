To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic implemented in the code and see if it adheres to the problem description.

The problem asks us to represent a given positive integer \( n_i \) as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite numbers. If it is not possible to represent it in this way, we should return -1.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of queries and then processes each query to get the integer \( n_i \).

2. **Logic for Handling Each Query:**
   - If \( n_i \) is odd, the program subtracts 9 from it and increments a counter \( c \) by 1.
   - It then checks if the adjusted \( n_i \) (after potential subtraction) is one of the specific numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) that cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers. If it is, the program outputs -1.
   - If the adjusted \( n_i \) is not one of those numbers, it calculates and outputs \( \frac{a}{4} + c \).

3. **Composite Numbers:**
   - The smallest composite number is 4.
   - The program does not handle the case for numbers less than 4 appropriately, as any number (1, 2, 3) should return -1.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not explicitly handle cases where \( n_i \) is less than 4. For \( n_i = 1, 2, 3 \), it returns -1 correctly due to the check against the specific numbers. However, it also needs to handle numbers like \( n_i = 4 \) and \( n_i = 5 \) correctly:
  - For \( n_i = 4 \), the maximum number of composite summands is 1 (4 itself).
  - For \( n_i = 5 \), it should return -1 since 5 cannot be summed with composite numbers.
- The logic for odd numbers modifies them by subtracting 9, which could lead to incorrect results for certain inputs (e.g., for \( n_i = 9 \)).
  
### Test Cases:
To illustrate the issue, let's consider a few test cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: 9
  - Expected Output: 1 (as 9 can be represented as 4 + 4 + 1, but 1 is not composite)
  - Program Output: -1 (because 0 is not checked correctly)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: 4
  - Expected Output: 1 (4 itself)
  - Program Output: 1 (this is correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: 5
  - Expected Output: -1 (5 cannot be split into composite summands)
  - Program Output: -1 (this is correct)

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly for odd numbers and numbers that result in a non-composite sum. Thus, the logic is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
