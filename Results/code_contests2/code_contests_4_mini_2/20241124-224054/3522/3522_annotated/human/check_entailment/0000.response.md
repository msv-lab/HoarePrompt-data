To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the problem requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Each query provides a positive integer `ni`.
2. The goal is to represent `ni` as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands.
3. If no valid splittings exist, return -1.
4. A composite number is defined as an integer greater than 1 that is not prime.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for _ in xrange(input()):
        a = input()
        
        c = 0
        
        if a % 2 != 0:
            a = a - 9
            c = 1
        
        print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `q` which is the number of queries.
   - It then reads `ni` for each query.

2. **Logic for Composite Splitting**:
   - If `ni` is odd, it subtracts 9 and sets `c` to 1.
   - It then checks if the modified `a` (or `ni` itself if it was even) is in the set of small numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it prints -1.
   - If `a` is not in this set, it calculates the number of composite summands as `a / 4 + c`.

3. **Composite Number Logic**:
   - The code assumes that all composite numbers can be represented as sums of 4's (the smallest composite number is 4).
   - The adjustment for odd numbers (subtracting 9 and adding 1 to the count of summands) is an attempt to handle odd cases.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Specific Values**:
   - The code only checks for small numbers that cannot be represented. However, it fails to consider all cases of composite summands properly. For instance:
     - `ni = 6`: The output should be 1 (6 = 4 + 2 or 6 = 6) but due to the check for small numbers, it will incorrectly output -1.
     - `ni = 9`: It will output -1 because `9` is not in the set checked, but 9 cannot be split into valid composite summands.
     - `ni = 10`: It will output 1 because it calculates `10 / 4 + 0 = 2`, but 10 = 4 + 6 which is valid.
     - `ni = 11`: Outputs -1, but it cannot form composite summands.

2. **General Case**:
   - The code does not correctly handle odd numbers that are greater than 11 and cannot be represented as composite summands. For example, `ni = 15` should output 1 (since 15 = 4 + 4 + 7) but will not be handled correctly by this logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not accurately handle all cases of composite number splitting, particularly for various odd integers and some even integers. There are multiple instances where the output will be incorrect based on the logic described.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
