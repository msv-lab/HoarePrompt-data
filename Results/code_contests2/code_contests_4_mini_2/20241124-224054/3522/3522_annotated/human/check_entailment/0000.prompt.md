You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given several queries. In the i-th query you are given a single positive integer ni. You are to represent ni as a sum of maximum possible number of composite summands and print this maximum number, or print -1, if there are no such splittings.

An integer greater than 1 is composite, if it is not prime, i.e. if it has positive divisors not equal to 1 and the integer itself.

Input

The first line contains single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 105) — the number of queries.

q lines follow. The (i + 1)-th line contains single integer ni (1 ≤ ni ≤ 109) — the i-th query.

Output

For each query print the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting to composite summands, or -1, if there are no such splittings.

Examples

Input

1
12


Output

3


Input

2
6
8


Output

1
2


Input

3
1
2
3


Output

-1
-1
-1

Note

12 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 4 + 8 = 6 + 6 = 12, but the first splitting has the maximum possible number of summands.

8 = 4 + 4, 6 can't be split into several composite summands.

1, 2, 3 are less than any composite number, so they do not have valid splittings.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    for _ in xrange(input()):
        a = input()
        
        c = 0
        
        if a % 2 != 0:
            a = a - 9
            c = 1
        
        print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `a` is an odd positive integer, then `c` is 1, and it prints -1 if `a - 9` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints `(a - 9) / 4 + 1`. If `a` is an even positive integer, then `c` is 0, and it prints -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints `a / 4 + 0`. If `a` is not a valid positive integer, it raises a type error. The loop does not execute if `q` is 0 or if there are no valid inputs provided.

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
