Output State: **If `a` is an odd positive integer, then `c` is 1, and it prints -1 if `a - 9` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints `(a - 9) / 4 + 1`. If `a` is an even positive integer, then `c` is 0, and it prints -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints `a / 4 + 0`. If `a` is not a valid positive integer, it raises a type error. The loop does not execute if `q` is 0 or if there are no valid inputs provided.**
