Postcondition: ***`q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `ni` is a positive integer for each query, and `a` is a string input representing an odd positive integer. If `a` is odd, then `a` is decremented by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, the value of `a` remains unchanged and `c` remains 0. Additionally, since `a` is a string input, it should represent an odd positive integer, thus ensuring that the operation maintains the integrity of the input type.***
