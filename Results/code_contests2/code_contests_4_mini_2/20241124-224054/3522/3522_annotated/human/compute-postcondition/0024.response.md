The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, it processes a sequence of queries where each query is a positive integer `ni`. The function is designed to handle multiple queries, specifically `q` queries, where `q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, and each `ni` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 1,000,000,000. The output of the function will vary based on the processing of these queries, but the specific return values are not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes a series of queries, each represented by a positive integer `ni`, returning results based on the queries.**
