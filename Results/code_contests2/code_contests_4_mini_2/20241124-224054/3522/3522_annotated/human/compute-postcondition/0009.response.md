The value of `a` is assigned the value from `input()`, which accepts a user input as a string. Since `a` was initially an odd positive integer, its value will change to whatever is inputted. The variable `c` remains unaffected, still holding the value of 2. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input string (which can be any odd positive integer), `c` is 2.

Output State: **`a` is an input string, `c` is 2**
