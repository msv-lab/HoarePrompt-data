The operation `a = a - 9` attempts to subtract the integer `9` from the string `a`. Since `a` is an input string, this operation will not work correctly. Therefore, the state of the variables does not change due to the error. 

Output State: **`a` is an input string, `c` is 0, and an error occurs due to attempting to subtract an integer from a string.**
