According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the number of queries provided by `input()`. Since `q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), it ensures that there is at least one iteration of the loop. The loop will execute `q` times. However, the specific value of `ni` for each query is not defined until the loop starts executing, so we can only state that `ni` must be a positive integer for each iteration. 

At the start of the loop, since we are using `xrange(input())`, we need to set the loop variable, which is typically ignored in this case (represented by `_`). Therefore, the state should reflect that `q` is defined, and we can indicate that `ni` is ready to take on positive integer values.

State: **`q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `ni` is a positive integer for each query**
