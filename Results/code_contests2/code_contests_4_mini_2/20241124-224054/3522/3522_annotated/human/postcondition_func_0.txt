The function accepts no parameters and processes a series of queries where each query is a positive integer. For each integer `a`, if `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from it and checks if the result is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), returning -1 if true; otherwise, it calculates and prints `(a - 9) / 4 + 1`. If `a` is even, it checks if `a` is in the same set, returning -1 if true; otherwise, it prints `a / 4`. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, which can lead to a potential TypeError. If the input is zero or invalid, the loop does not execute.
