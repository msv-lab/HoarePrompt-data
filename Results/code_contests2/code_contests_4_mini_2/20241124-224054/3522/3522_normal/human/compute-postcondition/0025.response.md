The function `func` accepts no parameters and processes a series of positive integer inputs based on the number of queries specified by the user. For each positive integer `a` provided, the function checks if `a` is odd; if it is, `9` is subtracted from `a`, and a counter `c` is set to `1`. The function then evaluates whether the modified or original `a` is among the specific set of numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, the function outputs `-1`. If not, it computes and outputs the value of `a / 4 + c`. 

The functionality of the function can be summarized as follows: It processes multiple queries, adjusts the input based on whether it is odd, checks for specific values, and outputs either a modified value or `-1` based on these conditions. There is potential for unexpected results if the input is not a positive integer, as the function does not handle input validation or errors. 

Functionality: ** The function processes multiple queries of positive integers, adjusting each integer if it is odd, and returns -1 for specific values or computes a modified value based on integer division and a counter. **
