The value of `c` is assigned the value of 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, but it is now updated to 1. The values of the other variables, `q`, `_`, and `a`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is greater than or equal to 1; `_` is 0; `a` is an input integer minus 9; `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1; `_` is 0; `a` is an input integer minus 9; `c` is 1**
