`c` is assigned the value of 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, so now `c` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 0, `a` is an input odd integer minus 9, `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 0, `a` is an input odd integer minus 9, `c` is 1**
