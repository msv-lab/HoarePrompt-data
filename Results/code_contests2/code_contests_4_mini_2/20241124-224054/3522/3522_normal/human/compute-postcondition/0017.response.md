The variable `c` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the other variables (`q`, `_`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `c` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is 0**
