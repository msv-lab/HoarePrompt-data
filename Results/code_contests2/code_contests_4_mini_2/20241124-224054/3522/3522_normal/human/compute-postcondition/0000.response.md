According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided to `xrange`. The `input()` function will return the value of `q`, which represents the number of queries. For the loop to execute, `q` must be at least 1. The loop will iterate `q` times, and during each iteration, a positive integer `ni` must be provided for the i-th query.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `q` should be at least 1, and we can denote that the loop is ready to start with `_` representing the current iteration (starting from 0).

State: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 0**
