The value of `a` is decremented by 9. Since `a` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 2, the new value of `a` will be at least -7. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer after decrementing by 9, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer after decrementing by 9, `c` is 0**
