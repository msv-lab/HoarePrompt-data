To determine the output state, we analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

1. The variable `a` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2. It can either be odd or even.
2. If `a` is odd, it is decremented by 9, and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, it remains unchanged, and `c` remains 0.
3. The expression in the print statement evaluates whether `a` is in the tuple (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). Since `a` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 2, it can only be 2 or higher, so we will consider both scenarios.

Now, let's break it down based on the parity of `a`:

- If `a` is even (e.g., 2, 4, 6, etc.), `c` is 0, and the print statement will evaluate to `a / 4 + 0 = a / 4`.
- If `a` is odd (e.g., 3, 5, 7, etc.), `c` becomes 1 after decrementing `a` by 9. Here, `a` can still be greater than or equal to 2, which means it should be evaluated in the context of the print statement as well.

Next, we check if the modified value of `a` (after decrementing by 9) is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) or not.

- If `a` is odd and the modified value is within the tuple, the print statement would yield -1.
- Otherwise, it would result in a calculation of `(a - 9) / 4 + 1`.

Overall, since the exact value of `a` is an input integer that can vary widely, the output state will include the variable states as described.

Output State: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, and based on the parity of `a`, the output is either -1 or `(a / 4)` or `(a - 9) / 4 + 1` depending on the conditions specified.**
