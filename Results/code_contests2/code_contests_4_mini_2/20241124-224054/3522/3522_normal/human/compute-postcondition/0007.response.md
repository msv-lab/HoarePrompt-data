To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the code snippet on the initial variables based on the given conditions.

1. The variable `a` can either be an odd or even integer.
2. If `a` is odd, it will be updated to `a - 9`, and `c` will be set to `1`.
3. If `a` is even, both `a` and `c` remain unchanged.
4. The expression `print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c` will evaluate based on the final value of `a` and `c`.

Now, let's analyze the output state based on different scenarios for `a`:

- If `a` is odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11):
  - The new value of `a` will be `a - 9`.
  - `c` will be `1`.
  - If the new `a` (after being modified) is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the output will be `-1`. If not, the output will be `(a - 9) / 4 + 1`.

- If `a` is even (e.g., 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10):
  - `a` remains unchanged.
  - `c` remains unchanged.
  - The output will be `-1` if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If not, the output will be `a / 4 + 0`.

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided in the initial conditions, we cannot compute specific numerical results. However, we can conclude on the possibilities based on the conditions.

Output State: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1; `_` is 0; `a` is an input value; `c` is either 1 or unchanged; the output will be -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it will be `a / 4 + c`.**
