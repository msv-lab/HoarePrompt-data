The value of `a` is decremented by 9. Since `a` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, the new value of `a` will be less than or equal to -7 after the operation. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is greater than or equal to 1; `_` is 0; `a` is an input integer minus 9; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1; `_` is 0; `a` is an input integer minus 9; `c` is 0**
