To determine the output state, we analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

1. The initial state specifies that `q` is greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 0, and `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. The conditions for `a` based on its odd or even nature will affect its value and the value of `c`.
2. If `a` is odd, `a` is decreased by 9, and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, `a` remains unchanged, and `c` remains 0.
3. The code snippet checks if `a` is in the set of prime numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it prints -1; otherwise, it computes `a / 4 + c`.

The output will depend on the parity of `a` (odd or even):

- If `a` is odd and greater than or equal to 9, then `a` becomes `a - 9` (which is also even), and `c` becomes 1. If `a` is odd and less than 9, it would become a negative value, which does not affect the output since it's not prime.
- If `a` is even, the value of `c` is 0, and `a` remains the same.

Now to calculate the result based on the values of `a`:

- For `a` = 2 (even): it remains 2, and `c` is 0. The expression evaluates to `2 / 4 + 0 = 0.5`.
- For `a` = 3 (odd): it becomes `3 - 9 = -6`, and `c` is 1. The expression evaluates to `-6 / 4 + 1 = -1.5`.
- For `a` = 4 (even): it remains 4, and `c` is 0. The expression evaluates to `4 / 4 + 0 = 1`.
- For `a` = 5 (odd): it becomes `5 - 9 = -4`, and `c` is 1. The expression evaluates to `-4 / 4 + 1 = 0`.
- For `a` = 6 (even): it remains 6, and `c` is 0. The expression evaluates to `6 / 4 + 0 = 1.5`.
- For `a` = 7 (odd): it becomes `7 - 9 = -2`, and `c` is 1. The expression evaluates to `-2 / 4 + 1 = 0.5`.
- For `a` = 8 (even): it remains 8, and `c` is 0. The expression evaluates to `8 / 4 + 0 = 2`.
- For `a` = 9 (odd): it becomes `9 - 9 = 0`, and `c` is 1. The expression evaluates to `0 / 4 + 1 = 1`.
- For `a` = 10 (even): it remains 10, and `c` is 0. The expression evaluates to `10 / 4 + 0 = 2.5`.

Since the output depends on the specific value of `a`, the final output will change based on which integer value of `a` is being considered. However, as the task requires a general output state without specific numbers, we summarize as follows:

Output State: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; the output depends on whether `a` is odd or even and its value, resulting in different calculations.**
