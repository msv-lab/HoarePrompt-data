To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step:

### Problem Description Recap
The task requires us to represent a given positive integer \( n_i \) as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands. If a valid splitting into composite summands is not possible, we should return -1.

### Code Analysis
```python
for _ in xrange(input()):
    a = input()
    c = 0
    if a % 2 != 0:
        a = a - 9
        c = 1
    print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of queries and each integer \( n_i \).
2. **Odd Handling**: If \( n_i \) is odd, it subtracts 9 from it and increments a counter \( c \) to indicate that one composite summand (9) has been accounted for.
3. **Evaluating Validity**: The program checks if the adjusted \( a \) is in the set \( (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) \). These numbers are all less than the smallest composite number (4). If \( a \) belongs to this set, it outputs -1, indicating no valid splittings are possible.
4. **Output Calculation**: If \( a \) is not in that set, it computes \( a / 4 + c \) to determine the maximum number of composite summands.

### Edge Cases
- For \( n_i = 6 \): The code will output \( 6 / 4 + 1 = 1 \) which is correct because it can be split into \( 4 + 2 \) (note that 2 is not composite, hence only one composite summand can be used).
- For \( n_i = 8 \): The code will output \( 8 / 4 = 2 \) which is correct because it can be represented as \( 4 + 4 \).
- For \( n_i = 1, 2, 3 \): The code correctly outputs -1 since they cannot be expressed as the sum of composite numbers.
- For \( n_i = 9 \): The code will adjust \( a \) to \( 0 \) and output -1, which is incorrect. \( 9 \) can be represented as \( 4 + 5 \) (where \( 4 \) is composite), thus there should be valid summands.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints suggest that the function processes multiple queries and returns specific values based on adjustments made to each integer. However, the hints fail to note the potential for valid composite summands for certain integers (like 9), leading to a discrepancy.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly account for all edge cases, specifically when \( n_i = 9 \). The logic fails for \( n \) values that can be represented as a sum of composite numbers but are incorrectly evaluated to -1 due to the check against the set of small integers.

Correctness: **False**. The program does not handle the case where \( n_i = 9 \) correctly, which is a valid input that should yield a result indicating the presence of composite summands.
