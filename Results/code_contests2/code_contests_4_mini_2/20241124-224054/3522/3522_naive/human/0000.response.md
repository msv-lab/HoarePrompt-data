To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles different inputs.

The program is intended to find the maximum number of composite summands that can sum up to a given integer `ni`. The program has the following logic:

1. **Odd Numbers**: If the number `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from it and increments `c` by 1. This change is to make `a` even since all composite numbers greater than 4 are even.
2. **Invalid Cases**: It checks if the adjusted `a` is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}. If so, it returns -1 as these numbers cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers.
3. **Count of Composites**: If the adjusted `a` is valid, it calculates the number of composite summands by dividing `a` by 4 and adding `c`.

Let's analyze the provided code with some specific cases:

**Case 1**: For input `1`, `2`, `3`, the program returns `-1` correctly since these numbers are less than any composite number.

**Case 2**: For input `6`, the program checks `a` after the conditions. It will return `1`, which is correct since `6` can be expressed as `4 + 2`, but `2` is not composite. The correct output should actually be `1` as it can be expressed as `4 + 2`, which includes one composite number.

**Case 3**: For input `8`, the program returns `2`, which is correct since `8` can be expressed as `4 + 4`. 

**Case 4**: For input `9`, the program will subtract 9 turning `a` to 0, yet the output won't represent composite summands correctly. 

**Case 5**: For input `10`, the program will check `a` being 10 and return `2` (as `10 = 4 + 4 + 2`), but it should ideally be `2` since it can be expressed correctly.

**Case 6**: For a large number, say `18`, the program will return `4`, which would be correct since `18 = 4 + 4 + 4 + 6` (using 4 as the composite).

However, if we examine case `9` more closely:
- `9` will result in `a` being adjusted to `0` and will check if `0` is in the invalid set, which it is not. Thus, it will yield `0`, which is incorrect for the case of composite summands.

This illustrates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, especially involving odd numbers and those that after adjustment lead to a zero value.

Correctness: **False**.
