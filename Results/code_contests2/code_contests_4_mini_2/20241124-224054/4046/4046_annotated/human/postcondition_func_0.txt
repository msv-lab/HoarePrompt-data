The function reads an integer `n` from user input and calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n` that can be formed using an equal count of the digits '4' and '7'. If no such integer can be formed within a length of up to 10 digits, it returns 4444477777. The function does not directly return a value but prints the result instead. It handles cases where the number of digits in `n` is odd by incrementing it to the next even number.
