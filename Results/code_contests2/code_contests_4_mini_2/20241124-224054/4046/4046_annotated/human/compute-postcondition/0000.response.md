The code snippet assigns the value of `n` to `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. However, since `n` is already defined as a positive integer, the new value of `n` will be determined by user input, which can range from 1 to 10^9. The previous value of `n` will be overwritten by the input value. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the change in `n` due to the input, but we cannot determine the exact value of `n` without specific input. Therefore, we state that `n` is now the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer**
