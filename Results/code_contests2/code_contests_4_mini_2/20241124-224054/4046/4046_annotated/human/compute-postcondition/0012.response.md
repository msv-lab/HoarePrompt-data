Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is an even integer less than 10, and `i` is equal to `l`. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x', then `tem` is assigned the integer value of `x` concatenated and converted to an integer. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. If the counts of '7' and '4' are not equal, no changes are made to `ans`. This encompasses all scenarios of the conditional logic.***
