The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The variable `x` is not defined in the initial state, so the impact of this code cannot be determined without knowledge of `x`. Other variables `n`, `l`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `l` is an even integer less than 8, `i` is equal to `l + 1`, and the value of `tem` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is an even integer less than 8, `i` is equal to `l + 1`, and the value of `tem` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `x`.**
