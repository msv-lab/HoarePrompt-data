Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is an even integer less than 8, and `i` is equal to `l`. If the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is formed by joining the elements of `x` into a string and converting it to an integer. If this integer `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.***
