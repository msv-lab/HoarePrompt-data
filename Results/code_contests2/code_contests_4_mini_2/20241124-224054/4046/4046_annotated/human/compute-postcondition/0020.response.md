The code assigns `ans` the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. However, since `tem` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `x`, the output state cannot specify its value. The previous values of `ans`, `n`, `l`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `l` is an even integer less than 8, `i` is equal to `l + 1`, and the value of `tem` cannot be determined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is an even integer less than 8, `i` is equal to `l + 1`, and the value of `tem` cannot be determined**
