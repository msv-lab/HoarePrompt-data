Postcondition: ***If `tem` (which is 77777774) is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and 77777774. If `tem` is less than `n`, then `ans` remains unchanged. Thus, `ans` will be either its original value or 77777774, depending on the comparison with `n`.***
