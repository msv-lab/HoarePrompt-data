To analyze the provided code snippet, we start with the initial state: `l` is 6, `i` is 9, and `x` is the first combination from `product('74', repeat=9')`. The `product` function generates cartesian products, and in this case, `product('74', repeat=9)` will create combinations of '7' and '4' repeated 9 times.

The first combination generated by `product('74', repeat=9')` will be '777777777', as it starts with all elements being the first element ('7') of the input iterable.

Now, we have:
- `x` is '777777777'.

Next, we execute the line of code:
```
tem = int(''.join(x))
```
The `join` function takes an iterable (in this case, a string) and concatenates it into a single string. Since `x` is already a string, `''.join(x)` will simply return '777777777'.

Then, we convert this string to an integer using `int()`, so `tem` becomes:
- `tem = int('777777777')` which results in `tem = 777777777`.

The values of `l` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the final values of all variables involved.

Output State: **`l` is 6, `i` is 9, `x` is '777777777', `tem` is 777777777**
