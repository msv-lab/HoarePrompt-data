Postcondition: ***`l` is the next even integer greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged if `tem` is less than `n`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. Additionally, `i` is `l + 2` and is at least 4, and `tem` is an integer derived from the string conversion of `x`.***
