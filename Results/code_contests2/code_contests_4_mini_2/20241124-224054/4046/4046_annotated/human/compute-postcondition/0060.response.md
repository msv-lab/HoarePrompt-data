In the provided code, `ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `ans`, so we cannot determine its value. The other variables `l`, `i`, `x`, and `tem` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, since we do not have information about `ans`, the output state will indicate that `ans` remains unknown while `tem` is 777777777.

Output State: **`l` is 6, `i` is 9, `x` is '777777777', `tem` is 777777777, and `ans` is unknown**
