Postcondition: ***`l` is 6, `i` is 8, and `x` is the second combination from `product('74', repeat=8')`. If the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, resulting in `tem` being 77777774, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and 77777774. If the counts are not equal, or if `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. Thus, `ans` will either retain its previous value or be updated to 77777774 if the conditions are met.***
