The variable `x` is assigned the first combination from `product('74', repeat=8)`, which will generate a string consisting of 8 characters that are either '7' or '4'. Since the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and there are 8 characters in total, both counts must be 4. Therefore, `x` would be '77774444'.

The line `tem = int(''.join(x))` converts the string representation of `x` into an integer. The string '77774444' converts to the integer `77774444`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is 6, `ans` may remain unchanged, `i` is 8, `x` is '77774444', and `tem` is 77774444.

Output State: **`l` is 6, `ans` may remain unchanged, `i` is 8, `x` is '77774444', and `tem` is 77774444**
