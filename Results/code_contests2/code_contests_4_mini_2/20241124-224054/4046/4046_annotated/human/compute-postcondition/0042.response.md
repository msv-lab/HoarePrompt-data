Postcondition: ***`l` is the next even integer greater than 0, and `i` is increased by 1. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4', `tem` is assigned the integer value of the concatenated string of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. If the count of '7' is not equal to the count of '4', no changes are made to `ans`.***
