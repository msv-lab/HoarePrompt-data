Postcondition: ***`l` is 6, `i` is 8, `x` is the first combination from `product('74', repeat=8')`, which contains an equal number of '7's and '4's. If the count of '7's in `x` equals the count of '4's, then `tem` is formed by joining `x` into an integer. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If the counts of '7's and '4's are not equal, no changes are made to `ans`.***
