Output State: **`ans` is the minimum value of all integers formed by combinations of '7' and '4' with equal counts, repeated `i` times, that are greater than or equal to `l`. If there are no valid combinations, `ans` remains unchanged. If `i` is less than 1, or if `l` is negative, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
