Postcondition: ***Given that `l` is 6, `i` is 9, and `x` is the string '777777777', if the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal (which they are), then `tem` is calculated as 777777777. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, there is no change to `ans`. Thus, `l` remains 6, `i` remains 9, `x` remains '777777777', and `tem` is 777777777, with `ans` either updated or unchanged based on the comparison with `n`.***
