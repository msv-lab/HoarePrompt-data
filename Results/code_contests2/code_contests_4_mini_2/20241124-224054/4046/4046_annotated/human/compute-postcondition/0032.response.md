Postcondition: ***`l` is the next even integer greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged if `tem` is less than `n`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, where `tem` is an integer derived from the string conversion of `x`. Additionally, `i` is `l + 2` and is at least 4. If the count of '7's in `x` equals the count of '4's, the conditions concerning `tem` and `ans` apply.***
