`tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. However, since `ans` remains unchanged if `tem` is less than `n`, the initial state of `ans` is retained. The values of `l` and `i` are also unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the uncertainty of `tem` and retains the other variable states.

Output State: **`l` is the next even integer greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged if `tem` is less than `n`, `i` is 6, and `tem` is an integer formed by joining elements of `x`.**
