The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. This means that the variable `x`, which contains some values, is being joined into a single string and then converted to an integer. The exact value of `tem` depends on the content of `x`, which is not provided. However, the other variables (`l`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged. 

Since `x` has a count of '7' equal to the count of '4', but we do not know the specific content of `x`, we cannot determine the exact integer value of `tem`. Therefore, we conclude that the value of `tem` is not determined. 

The output state indicates that `l`, `ans`, and `i` are unchanged, and `tem` is assigned an integer value based on the joining and converting process of `x`.

Output State: **`l` is the next even integer greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is `l + 2` and is at least 4, and `tem` is an integer derived from the string conversion of `x`.**
