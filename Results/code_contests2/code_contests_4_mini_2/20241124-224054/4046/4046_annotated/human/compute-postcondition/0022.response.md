Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is an even integer less than 8, `i` is equal to `l + 1`, and if the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, the variable `tem` is assigned the integer value formed by concatenating the characters of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. If the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are not equal, no changes are made to `ans`.***
