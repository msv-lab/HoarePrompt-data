Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is an even integer less than 8, `i` is equal to `l`, and `tem` is an integer from the joining operation on `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
