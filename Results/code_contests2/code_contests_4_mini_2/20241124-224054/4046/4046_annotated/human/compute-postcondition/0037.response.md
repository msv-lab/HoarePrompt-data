Postcondition: ***`l` is the next even integer greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged if `tem` (formed by joining elements of `x`) is less than `n`. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4', and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged.***
