According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `l` is an even integer that is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `l` is either an odd integer or less than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be adjusted to an even integer greater than 0. Additionally, since the loop starts with `l` and increments by 2 each time, the next value of `i` will be `l + 2`. 

Therefore, the adjustments needed are:
- `l` must be adjusted to the next even integer greater than 0.
- `i` should be updated to reflect the new value of `l` plus 2.

State: **`l` is the next even integer greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is `l + 2`**
