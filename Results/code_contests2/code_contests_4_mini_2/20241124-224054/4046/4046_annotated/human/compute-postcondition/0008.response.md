The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The operation `join(x)` concatenates the elements of `x` into a single string, and then `int()` converts that string into an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is equal to `l` (where `i` is >= 0), and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x'. However, the specific value of `x` is not provided, nor can it be determined from the given initial state.

Since the output of `tem` is dependent solely on the value of `x`, which is unspecified, we cannot conclude a specific integer value for `tem`. Therefore, the output state must reflect that `tem` is assigned a value based on the conversion of `x` to an integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is equal to `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x', and `tem` is assigned the value of int(''.join(x)) based on the value of x.**
