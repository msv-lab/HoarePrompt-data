The code assigns `ans` the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. The previous values of the affected variables are `ans` and `tem`, but since their specific values are not provided, we can't determine their exact numerical states. However, we know that `tem` is an integer obtained from the joining operation on `x`, and `ans` is compared against this value. 

The output state will reflect that `ans` is updated based on the minimum comparison, but we cannot specify exact values for `ans` or `tem`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is an even integer less than 8, `i` is equal to `l`, `tem` is an integer from the joining operation on `x`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`**.
