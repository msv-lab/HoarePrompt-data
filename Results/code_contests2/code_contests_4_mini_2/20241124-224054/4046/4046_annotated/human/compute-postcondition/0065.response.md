According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `l` to `10` with a step of `2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `10`. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is less than `10`, it will need to increment by `2` for the next iteration. The value of `l` must also be adjusted to ensure that it remains within the loopâ€™s valid range for the next iteration.

1. Since `i` must be less than `10`, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted to a value that is still less than `10`.
2. The starting value `l` must be less than or equal to the current value of `i` to ensure the loop continues to run.

Assuming `i` is currently less than `10`, we adjust `l` to ensure the loop iterates correctly. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure `l` is less than `i` and `i` is appropriately set to be less than `10`.

State: **`ans` is the minimum value of all integers formed by combinations of '7' and '4' with equal counts, repeated `i` is less than `10`, and `l` is less than or equal to `i`**
