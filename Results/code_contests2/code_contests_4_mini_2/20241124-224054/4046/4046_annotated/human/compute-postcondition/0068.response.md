The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it operates under the constraint that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without further details on the output, we cannot determine the specific return value of the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates under the constraint that n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The return value is unspecified.**
