The variable `x` is assigned the second combination from `product('74', repeat=8')`. This means `x` will be a tuple containing the characters corresponding to the second combination of the digits '7' and '4' repeated 8 times. 

The second combination is '77777774'. 

Then, `tem` is assigned the value `int(''.join(x))`, which means the characters in `x` are joined into a single string '77777774' and then converted to an integer. 

The value of `tem` becomes 77777774. 

The values of `l` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `l` is 6, `i` is 8, `x` is '77777774', and `tem` is 77777774.

Output State: **`l` is 6, `i` is 8, `x` is '77777774', `tem` is 77777774**
