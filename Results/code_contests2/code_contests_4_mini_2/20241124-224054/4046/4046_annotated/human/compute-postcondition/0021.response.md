Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is an even integer less than 8, `i` is equal to `l + 1`, and the value of `tem` cannot be determined. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged.***
