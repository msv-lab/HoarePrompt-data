The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` is an odd number, after the increment, `l` will be even. The values of `n` and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the input integer, `l` is an odd number (now incremented to even), and `ans` is 4444477777.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `l` is an even number, `ans` is 4444477777**
