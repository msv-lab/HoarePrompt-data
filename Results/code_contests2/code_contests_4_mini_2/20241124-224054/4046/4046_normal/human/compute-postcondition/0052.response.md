Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4' in the generated combinations. If the count of '7's in `x` equals the count of '4's in `x` (which is true in this case), `tem` is calculated as 44444444. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, then `ans` remains unchanged. The values of `l` is 6, `i` is 8, `x` is '44444444', and `tem` is 44444444. Thus, if the conditions are met, `ans` reflects the minimum of its current state and 44444444; otherwise, it remains as it was initially.***
