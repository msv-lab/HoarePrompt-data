The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a positive integer value within the range of 1 to \(10^9\). Since no specific value for `n` is provided, we can only state that it is a positive integer. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9**
