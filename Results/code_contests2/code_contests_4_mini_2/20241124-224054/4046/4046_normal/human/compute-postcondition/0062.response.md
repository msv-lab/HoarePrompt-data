Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4'; `l` remains unchanged; `i` remains unchanged; `tem` is the integer formed by `''.join(x)`. If `x` has an equal count of '7' and '4', then if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, or if `x` does not have an equal count of '7' and '4', `ans` remains unchanged. This covers all edge cases regarding the relationship between `tem` and `n`, as well as the valid configurations of `x`.***
