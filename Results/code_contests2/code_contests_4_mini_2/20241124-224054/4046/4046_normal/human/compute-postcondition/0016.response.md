Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number between 2 and 8; `ans` is 4444477777; `tem` is 0. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, which could potentially change `ans` to a value less than or equal to 4444477777; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777.***
