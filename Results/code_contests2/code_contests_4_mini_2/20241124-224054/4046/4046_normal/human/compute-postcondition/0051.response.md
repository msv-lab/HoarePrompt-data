Postcondition: ***`ans` can either be 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4' in the generated combinations. If `tem` (which is 44444444) is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current state and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. The values of `l`, `i`, `x`, and `tem` are as follows: `l` is 6, `i` is 8, `x` is '44444444', and `tem` is 44444444.***
