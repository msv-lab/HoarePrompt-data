The value of `ans` is assigned the minimum of `ans` and `tem`. The current value of `ans` is 4444477777, and `tem` is 0. Since 0 is less than 4444477777, after the execution, `ans` will be updated to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number between 2 and 8; `ans` is 0; `tem` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number between 2 and 8; `ans` is 0; `tem` is 0**
