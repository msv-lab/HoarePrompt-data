Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number between 2 and 8; `ans` can be either 4444477777, 7474, or 74747474; `i` is equal to `l`; `x` is the string '74' repeated `i` times; `tem` is the integer formed by `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
