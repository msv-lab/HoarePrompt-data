The variable `x` is used to form a string consisting of the characters '7' and '4', which is then joined together and converted into an integer. The state of `tem` is updated with this integer value. The other variables `ans`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `tem` based on the current value of `x`.

Output State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4'; `l` remains the same; `i` remains the same; `tem` is updated to the integer formed by `''.join(x)`**
