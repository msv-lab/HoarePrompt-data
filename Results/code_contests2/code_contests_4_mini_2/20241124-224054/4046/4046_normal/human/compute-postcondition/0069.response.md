Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). It calculates the minimum integer composed of equal counts of the digits '4' and '7' that is greater than or equal to `n`. If no such integer can be formed, it defaults to 4444477777. The function then prints this result. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or where no valid combinations exist, which could lead to returning the default value without any valid output. **
