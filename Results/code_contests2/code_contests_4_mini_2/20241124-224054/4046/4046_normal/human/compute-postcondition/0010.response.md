To determine the output state, we begin by analyzing the provided initial state and the Python code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9
- `l` is an even number between 2 and 8
- `ans` is 4444477777
- `i` is `l`
- `x` is '74' repeated `i` times
- `tem` is an integer formed by the string `x`, such that `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`

Now, the code snippet modifies the value of `ans`:
```
ans = min(ans, tem)
```

Here, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (4444477777) and the value of `tem`. Since `tem` is formed from the string `x`, which is '74' repeated `i` times, we can infer that `tem` will be a specific integer that is based on the value of `l`.

Let's explore the possible scenarios based on the value of `l`:
- If `l = 2`, `x` becomes '7474', and `tem` is 7474.
- If `l = 4`, `x` becomes '74747474', and `tem` is 74747474.
- If `l = 6`, `x` becomes '747474747474', and `tem` is 747474747474.
- If `l = 8`, `x` becomes '7474747474747474', and `tem` is 7474747474747474.

Given that `tem` must be greater than or equal to `n`, let's analyze the possible minimum values for `ans`:
- For `l = 2`, `ans` would be updated to min(4444477777, 7474) = 7474
- For `l = 4`, `ans` would be updated to min(4444477777, 74747474) = 74747474
- For `l = 6`, `ans` would be updated to min(4444477777, 747474747474) = 4444477777 (since 747474747474 is greater)
- For `l = 8`, `ans` would be updated to min(4444477777, 7474747474747474) = 4444477777 (since 7474747474747474 is greater)

Thus, the value of `ans` will only change if `l` is 2 or 4, resulting in the following potential output states:
- If `l` is 2: `ans` is 7474
- If `l` is 4: `ans` is 74747474
- If `l` is 6 or 8: `ans` remains 4444477777

The output state will depend on the specific value of `l`. However, we can summarize the output state based on the changes to `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number between 2 and 8; `ans` is either 7474, 74747474, or remains 4444477777; `i` is `l`; `x` is '74' repeated `i` times; `tem` is the integer formed by `x`, such that `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
