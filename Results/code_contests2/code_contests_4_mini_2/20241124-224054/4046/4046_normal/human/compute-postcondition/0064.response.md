Output State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4' from the combinations generated. If the loop executes, `x` will represent different combinations of '7' and '4' of length `i` (8). If `x` has an equal count of '7' and '4', then `tem` is set to the integer formed by `''.join(x)`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, or if `x` does not have an equal count of '7' and '4', `ans` remains unchanged. If `i` is less than or equal to 0, or if `n` is not defined or less than the minimum possible integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4', the loop will not execute, and `ans` will remain as initially set.**
