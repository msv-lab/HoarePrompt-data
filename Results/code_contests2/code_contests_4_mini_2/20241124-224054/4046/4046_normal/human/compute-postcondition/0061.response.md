Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4'; `l` remains unchanged; `i` remains unchanged; `tem` is the integer formed by `''.join(x)`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged.***
