Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 4444477777 or 444444, `l` remains 6, `i` is 8, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. The value of `tem` remains undetermined due to the undefined variable `x`.***
