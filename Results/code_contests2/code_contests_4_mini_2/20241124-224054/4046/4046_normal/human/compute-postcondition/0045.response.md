According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `l` and the ending value. The loop is set to iterate from `l` (which is 6) to 10, incrementing by 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 6, meaning it could be 6, 8, or any value less than 10. If `i` is currently 6, it will enter the loop again, but if `i` is already 8, it will execute one more time. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 8 (if it was 6) or remain at 8 (if it was already 8). Therefore, it can be concluded that `i` must be adjusted to 8 for the loop to execute one more time.

The value of `ans` does not need to be changed because it will remain at either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4', depending on the conditions. 

Thus, the necessary changes to the states are:
- `i` needs to be adjusted to 8.

State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4' in the generated combinations, `l` remains 6, `i` is 8**
