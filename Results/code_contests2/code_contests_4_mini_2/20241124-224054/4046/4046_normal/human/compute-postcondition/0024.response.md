Output State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` for each valid combination of '4's and '7's in `x`, where `x` is generated as a string of length `l` with equal counts of '4's and '7's. If `tem` (the integer formed from `x`) is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` may be updated; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `l` is not a valid even number (2 to 8) or if there are no combinations of '4's and '7's that satisfy the conditions, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 4444477777. Additionally, if `n` is not a positive integer within the specified range, it indicates a precondition failure.**
