The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the initial state, which means we cannot determine its value or the output of `''.join(x)`. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `tem` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `x`.

Output State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or 444444, `l` remains 6, `i` is 8, and the value of `tem` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `x`.**
