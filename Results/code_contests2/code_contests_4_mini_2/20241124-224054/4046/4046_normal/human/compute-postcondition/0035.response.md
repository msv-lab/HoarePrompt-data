`tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, but `x` is undefined, leading to an error. Therefore, the value of `tem` remains undefined. The `min` function cannot operate with `ans` and an undefined `tem`. The output state is: `ans` is either 4444477777 or 444444, `l` remains 6, `i` is 7, and `tem` is undefined due to `x` being undefined.

Output State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or 444444, `l` remains 6, `i` is 7, and `tem` is undefined due to `x` being undefined.**
