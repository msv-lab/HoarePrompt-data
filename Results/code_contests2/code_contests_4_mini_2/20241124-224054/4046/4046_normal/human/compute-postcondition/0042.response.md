Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 4444477777 or 444444, `l` remains 6, `i` is 8. If the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, then `tem` is calculated as an integer formed by joining the elements of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. If the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are not equal, there is no change to `ans`. The value of `tem` remains undetermined due to the undefined variable `x`.***
