Output State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4' in the generated combinations, `l` remains 6, `i` is at least 6. If `i` is less than 6, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than the maximum possible value formed by equal counts of '7' and '4' for the given `i`, `ans` also remains unchanged.**
