Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 4444477777 or 444444, `l` remains 6, `i` is 7. If the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, then `tem` is assigned a value based on `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If the counts are not equal, or if `tem` is less than `n`, or if `tem` is not defined, then `ans` remains unchanged.***
