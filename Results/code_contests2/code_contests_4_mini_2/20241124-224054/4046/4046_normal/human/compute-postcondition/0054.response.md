The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The value of `x` is '44444444', so `''.join(x)` will result in the string '44444444', and converting that to an integer gives `tem` the value 44444444. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4', `l` is 6, `i` is 9, `x` is '44444444', and `tem` is 44444444**
