The code assigns the value of `tem` to the integer conversion of the joined string `x`. The variable `x` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value and thus cannot compute `tem`. The output state indicates that the assignment took place, but we lack specific values for `x` and `tem`.

Output State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or 444444, `l` remains 6, `i` is 7, and `tem` is assigned the value of int(''.join(x)) where `x` is undefined.**
