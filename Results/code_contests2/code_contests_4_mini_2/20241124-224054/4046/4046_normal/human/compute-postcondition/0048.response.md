`tem` is assigned the value `int(''.join(x))`. The variable `x` is the string '44444444', and when joined (which has no effect since it's already a string) and converted to an integer, it results in `44444444`. The values of other variables (`ans`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4' in the generated combinations, `l` is 6, `i` is 8, and `x` is '44444444'; `tem` is 44444444. 

Output State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4' in the generated combinations, `l` is 6, `i` is 8, `x` is '44444444', and `tem` is 44444444**.
