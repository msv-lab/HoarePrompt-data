The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the value of `tem`. The initial value of `tem` is 44444444. The value of `ans` can either be 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4'. 

If `ans` is 4444477777, then the minimum between 4444477777 and 44444444 is 44444444. If `ans` is the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4', the exact value is not specified, but it would also be compared with 44444444.

Therefore, we can conclude that `ans` will be updated to 44444444 regardless of its initial value, given that 44444444 is less than or equal to 4444477777 and is likely less than or equal to the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4'.

Output State: **`ans` is 44444444, `l` is 6, `i` is 9, `x` is '44444444', and `tem` is 44444444**
