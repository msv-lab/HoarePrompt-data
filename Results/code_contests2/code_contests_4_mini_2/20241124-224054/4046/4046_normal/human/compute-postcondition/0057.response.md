Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4'. If `x` has an equal count of '7' and '4', then `tem` is set to 44444444. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. The values of `l`, `i`, `x`, and `tem` remain the same as in the precondition, and the overall state of `ans` reflects whether `tem` met or exceeded `n` while respecting the initial conditions.***
