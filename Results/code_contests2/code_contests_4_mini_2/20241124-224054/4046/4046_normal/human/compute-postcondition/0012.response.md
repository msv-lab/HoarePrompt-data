Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number between 2 and 8; `ans` is 4444477777 or updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, where `tem` is the integer formed by `x`, with `x` being the string '74' repeated `i` times (where `i` is equal to `l`). If the count of '7's in `x` equals the count of '4's in `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated. If `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. In all cases, `ans` retains its initial value if the condition is not met.***
