Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number between 2 and 8; `ans` is either 4444477777 or updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, where `tem` is an integer formed by the string `x`, which consists of the digit '7' and '4' repeated an equal number of times. If the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` may be updated to a value less than or equal to 4444477777; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777. Furthermore, it should be noted that `tem` will be 0 if `x` does not have the required condition of having equal counts of '7's and '4's, meaning `ans` will not change in that case.***
