Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `l` is the number of digits in `n`. If `l` is odd, then `l` is incremented by 1, resulting in `l` being an even number between 2 and 11. If `l` is already even, it remains unchanged. `ans` remains 4444477777 throughout the execution.***
