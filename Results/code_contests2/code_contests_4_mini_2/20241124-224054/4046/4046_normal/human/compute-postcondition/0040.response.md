The value of `ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. However, the value of `tem` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `x`. Therefore, we cannot compute the minimum. The previous value of `ans` could be either 4444477777 or 444444, and since `tem` is undefined, we cannot establish a new value for `ans`. The states of the other variables (`l` and `i`) are unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is either 4444477777 or 444444; `l` remains 6; `i` is 8; the value of `tem` cannot be determined.

Output State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or 444444; `l` remains 6; `i` is 8; the value of `tem` cannot be determined.**
