The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Given that `tem` is 444444 and `ans` can either be 4444477777 or updated, we compare these two values. Since 444444 is less than 4444477777, `ans` will be updated to 444444. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is either 444444 or updated to 444444, `l` is 6, `i` is 6, `x` is '444444', and `tem` is 444444.

Output State: **`ans` is either 444444 or updated to 444444, `l` is 6, `i` is 6, `x` is '444444', and `tem` is 444444**
