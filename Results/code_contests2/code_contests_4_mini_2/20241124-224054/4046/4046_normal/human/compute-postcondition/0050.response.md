The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Given that `tem` is 44444444 and `ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4', the possible values of `ans` are compared with `tem`. If `ans` is greater than `tem`, then `ans` will be updated to 44444444; otherwise, it will remain the same. 

The other variables (`l`, `i`, `x`) are not affected by this operation. 

Thus, the output state is: `l` is 6, `i` is 8, `x` is '44444444', `tem` is 44444444, and `ans` is either 44444444 or remains as it was.

Output State: **`l` is 6, `i` is 8, `x` is '44444444', `tem` is 44444444, and `ans` is either 44444444 or remains as it was.**
