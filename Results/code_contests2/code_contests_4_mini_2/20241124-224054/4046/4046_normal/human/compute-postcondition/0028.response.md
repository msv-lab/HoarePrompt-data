The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is '444444'. The `join` method concatenates the string `x`, and `int` converts it to an integer. Therefore, `tem` will be `444444`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or updated, `l` is 6, `i` is 6, `x` is '444444', and `tem` is 444444**
