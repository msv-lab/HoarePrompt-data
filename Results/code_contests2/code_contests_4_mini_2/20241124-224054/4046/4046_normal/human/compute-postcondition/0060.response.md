The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The initial state indicates that `ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4', while `tem` is defined as the integer formed by `''.join(x)`. The outcome of this operation will depend on the specific value of `tem`.

If `tem` is less than `ans`, then `ans` will be updated to `tem`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `ans`, then `ans` will remain unchanged. Thus, the minimum integer value will be determined based on the comparison.

Since the specific value of `tem` is unknown, we can express the possible outcomes for `ans`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the possible scenarios:

Output State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4'; `l` remains the same; `i` remains the same; `tem` is updated to the integer formed by `''.join(x)`; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.**
