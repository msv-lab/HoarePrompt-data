Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 4444477777 or 444444, `l` remains 6, `i` is 7, and `tem` is assigned a value based on the undefined `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is undefined or less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged.***
