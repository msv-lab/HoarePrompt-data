Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4'. If `tem` (which is 44444444) is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` (44444444). If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. The values of `l`, `i`, `x`, and `tem` remain the same as the precondition.***
