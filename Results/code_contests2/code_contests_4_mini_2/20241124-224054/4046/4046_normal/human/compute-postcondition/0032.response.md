Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 4444477777 or updated to the minimum of its original value and `tem` (which is 444444). Given that `x` is '444444', the counts of '7' and '4' are equal, so `tem` is calculated as 444444. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to this minimum value; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged at its original value. Additionally, `l` remains 6, and `i` remains 6 throughout the execution.***
