Output State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4' from the generated combinations based on the length `i`. If `l` is not a valid even number (2 to 10) or if there are no valid combinations of '4's and '7's that satisfy the conditions, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 4444477777. If `n` is not a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9), it indicates a precondition failure, and the loop does not execute. If `i` is less than `l`, the outer loop does not execute, and `ans` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `n` is greater than the maximum possible value formed by equal counts of '7' and '4' for the given `i`, `ans` also remains unchanged.**
