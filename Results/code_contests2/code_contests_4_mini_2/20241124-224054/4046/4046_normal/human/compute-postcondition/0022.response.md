Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number between 2 and 8; `ans` is either 4444477777 or updated based on the minimum value between its current state and `tem`, which is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. If the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated accordingly; if `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. If the count of '7's does not equal the count of '4's, no changes to `ans` occur.***
