According to the code, the loop will execute based on the combinations generated by `product('74', repeat=i)`. The variable `i` determines how many characters are in each combination of '7' and '4'.

At the end of the last iteration, the states indicate that `i` remains unchanged. Since `i` is constant, the loop will execute again for the next combination generated by `product('74', repeat=i)`.

The loop will continue to generate combinations until all possible combinations of length `i` have been exhausted. Therefore, we need to adjust `x` based on the next combination produced by the loop.

Since `x` represents the current combination of '7' and '4', and it will go through all combinations of length `i`, we need to adjust `x` to the next combination that could be generated by the previous iteration.

State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4', `l` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `tem` is the integer formed by `''.join(x)`, where `x` represents the next combination of '7' and '4' of length `i`.**
