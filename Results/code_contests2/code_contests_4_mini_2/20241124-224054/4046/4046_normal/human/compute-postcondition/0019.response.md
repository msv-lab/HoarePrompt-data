The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is presumably a list of strings that are concatenated together to form a single string before being converted to an integer. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the values of `l`, `ans`, and `i` are also unaffected. Therefore, the output state is contingent on the specific value of `x`, which is not provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number between 2 and 8; `ans` is either 4444477777 or updated; `i` is `i + 1`; `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`**
