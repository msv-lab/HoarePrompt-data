The variable `x` is assigned the first combination of '74' repeated `i` times. Since `i` is an even number between 2 and 8, `x` will be a string that consists of '74' repeated `i` times, which results in a string of length `2i`. The conversion of this string to an integer using `int(''.join(x))` will yield a numerical value. 

The value of `x`, formed by repeating '74', will have equal counts of '7' and '4'. 

The `tem` variable will be assigned the integer value of `x`, which will be a number formed by the repeated pattern of '74'. This means that `tem` will equal `74` repeated `i` times as an integer.

Since `l` is between 2 and 8, let's assume `i` is equal to `l` and can take values like 2, 4, 6, or 8. This results in:

- For `l = 2`: `x = '7474'`, `tem = 7474`
- For `l = 4`: `x = '74747474'`, `tem = 74747474`
- For `l = 6`: `x = '747474747474'`, `tem = 747474747474`
- For `l = 8`: `x = '7474747474747474'`, `tem = 7474747474747474`

However, since we don't have a specific value for `l`, we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the possibilities based on the assumptions made about `l`:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number between 2 and 8, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l`, `x` is '74' repeated `i` times, and `tem` is an integer formed by the string `x`.**
