The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Since `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, it is dependent on the contents of `x`, which is not specified. However, since `ans` can be either `4444477777` or updated, the output state will reflect both possibilities for `ans`. No other variables are affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number between 2 and 8; `ans` is either 4444477777 or updated; `i` is `i + 1`; `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))` and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number between 2 and 8; `ans` is either 4444477777 or updated; `i` is `i + 1`; `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`.**
