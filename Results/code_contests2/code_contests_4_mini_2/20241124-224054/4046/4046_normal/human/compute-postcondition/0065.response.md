According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the starting value `l`. The loop's range is defined as `range(l, 10, 2)`, which means it will iterate starting from `l` up to (but not including) 10, with a step of 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not explicitly provided but is implicitly determined by the range starting from `l`. Since the loop executes with `i` being even numbers starting from `l`, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than 10. Additionally, `i` must be adjusted to the next value in the sequence defined by `range(l, 10, 2)`.

If `l` is currently at an even number less than 10, the next execution would be for `i` at `l + 2`. If `l` is an odd number less than 9 (since we need to stay under 10), the next `i` would still be the next even number. 

Thus, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `l` needs to be less than or equal to 8.

State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum integer formed by equal counts of '7' and '4' from the combinations generated, l is less than or equal to 8, i is the next even number from l.**
