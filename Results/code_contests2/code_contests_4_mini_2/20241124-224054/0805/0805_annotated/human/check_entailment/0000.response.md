To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, we will analyze the logic and functionality of the code step by step.

The program is designed to shift each character in a string `S` of uppercase English letters by an integer `N`. The shifting is done in a circular manner, meaning that after `Z`, it wraps around to `A`.

### Code Logic Breakdown:
1. The program reads an integer `n` and a string `strings` consisting of uppercase letters.
2. It initializes a string `letters` containing the uppercase English alphabet.
3. It initializes an empty string `new_strings` to accumulate the results.
4. For each character `s` in `strings`:
   - It finds the index of `s` in the `letters` string.
   - It calculates a new index by adding `n` to the current index and applying modulo 26 to handle wrapping around.
   - It retrieves the new character using the newly calculated index and appends it to `new_strings`.
5. Finally, it prints the resulting shifted string.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Maximum Shift (`n = 26`)**: According to the problem, a shift of 26 should return the original string because it completes a full cycle. The program correctly handles this since `added_index % 26` will yield the original index.
   
2. **No Shift (`n = 0`)**: The program should return the original string without any modification. This is also handled correctly by the logic.

3. **Empty String**: The problem states that `S` will have a length of at least 1, so we don't need to consider empty strings. However, if for some reason an empty string were to be input, the program would simply return an empty string without error, which does not violate any constraints.

4. **Shift Beyond the Alphabet**: The program effectively handles shifts greater than 26 due to the modulo operation, ensuring that any shift results in a valid character.

Given these analyses, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all defined cases.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and considering various scenarios, there are no found cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. 

Correctness: **True**
