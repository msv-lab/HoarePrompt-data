The variable `new_strings` is updated by concatenating it with `new_s`. The previous value of `new_strings` is the original value, and `new_s` is derived from `letters` at the index `new_index`, which is at least `(index + 2) % 26`. Therefore, the output state is determined by the updated value of `new_strings` and the fact that `new_s` has been added to it. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 2; `S` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters; `strings` is `S`; `new_strings` is the original value of `new_strings` concatenated with `new_s`; `s` is the second character of `strings`; `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is at least `index + 2`; `new_index` is at least `(index + 2) % 26; `new_s` is `letters[new_index]`**
