The value of `new_index` is assigned the result of `added_index % 26`. The variable `added_index` is at least `index + 2`, where `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`. Therefore, `new_index` will be at least `(index + 2) % 26`. The specific value of `new_index` will depend on the exact values of `added_index` and will always be a value between 0 and 25 (the possible indices in a 26-letter alphabet). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 2; `S` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters; `strings` is `S`; `new_strings` is the original value of `new_strings` concatenated with `new_s`; `s` is the second character of `strings`; `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is at least `index + 2`; `new_index` is at least `(index + 2) % 26`.**
