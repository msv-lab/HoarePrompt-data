The code assigns `added_index` the value of `index + n`. The variable `index` holds the index of the character `s` in `letters`, and `n` is at least 2. Therefore, `added_index` will be at least `index + 2`. The specific value of `added_index` depends on the current value of `index`, which is unknown. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is at least 2; `S` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters; `strings` is `S`; `new_strings` is the original value of `new_strings` concatenated with `new_s`; `s` is the second character of `strings`; `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is at least `index + 2`.**
