The code assigns `new_index` the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is calculated as `index + N`, where `index` is the index of the first character `s` in the letters list. Since `N` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= N <= 26`, we can deduce that `added_index` will also range from the value of `index` to `index + 26`. Therefore, the value of `new_index` will be the remainder of `added_index` when divided by 26. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `S` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters; `strings` is `S`; `new_strings` is an empty string; `s` is the first character of `strings`; `index` is the index of `s` in the letters list; `added_index` is `index + N`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
