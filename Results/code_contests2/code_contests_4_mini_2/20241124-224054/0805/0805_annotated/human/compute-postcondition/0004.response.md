According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `strings`. For the loop to execute, `strings` must be a non-empty string, as the loop iterates over each character in `strings`. 

Given that `S` is defined as a string with a length between 1 and 10,000, it ensures that `strings` can be non-empty. In this scenario, we assume `strings` is assigned the value of `S`. Therefore, the state of `new_strings` is relevant at the start of the loop execution, but it remains unchanged by the loop's execution since it is initialized as an empty string.

Since `s` is the current character in `strings` during the loop, before the loop starts, we can set `s` to the first character of `strings`. 

State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters, `strings` is `S`, `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`**
