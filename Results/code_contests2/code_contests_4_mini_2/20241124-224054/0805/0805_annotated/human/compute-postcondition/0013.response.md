The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is determined by the previous calculation of `index + N`. Given that `N` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= N <= 26`, `added_index` is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer. 

Since the modulo operation (`%`) is being applied with 26, `new_index` will always be a value between 0 and 25, inclusive. The other variables (`N`, `S`, `strings`, `new_strings`, `s`, `index`, and `added_index`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `S` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters; `strings` is `S`; `new_strings` is the original value of `new_strings` concatenated with `new_s`; `s` is the next character in `strings`; `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + N`; `new_index` is between 0 and 25.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `S` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters; `strings` is `S`; `new_strings` is the original value of `new_strings` concatenated with `new_s`; `s` is the next character in `strings`; `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + N`; `new_index` is between 0 and 25.**
