The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its signature. However, it operates under the constraints that `N` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq N \leq 26\) and `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10,000. The function's output is not explicitly provided in the prompt. Therefore, based on the given constraints, we cannot determine the specific return value or functionality without further information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer N (0 ≤ N ≤ 26) and a string S consisting of uppercase English letters (length between 1 and 10,000), but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
