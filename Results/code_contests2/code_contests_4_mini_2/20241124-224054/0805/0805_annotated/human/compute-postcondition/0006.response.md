The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The variable `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, and `index` is the index of the first character `s` in the letters list. Therefore, `added_index` will take the value of `index` plus `n`. As `n` and `index` are not specifically defined in the initial state, we cannot calculate a specific numerical output for `added_index`. 

The output state reflects the information regarding the variables without specifying exact values. 

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `S` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters; `strings` is `S`; `new_strings` is an empty string; `s` is the first character of `strings`; `index` is the index of `s` in the letters list; `added_index` is `index + n`.**
