Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` and a string `strings` consisting of uppercase English letters. It shifts each letter in the string by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. The result is printed as a new string formed by the shifted letters. However, the function does not handle cases where `strings` includes characters that are not uppercase letters, nor does it validate that `n` is within the expected range (0 ≤ n ≤ 26). Additionally, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
