The `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The values of `index` and `n` are used directly from the initial state to compute `added_index`. The other variables, such as `new_index`, `new_s`, and `new_strings`, are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `added_index` along with the original values of the other variables.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `(index + 1 + n) % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[(index + 1 + n + 1) % 26]`, `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`, and `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`**
