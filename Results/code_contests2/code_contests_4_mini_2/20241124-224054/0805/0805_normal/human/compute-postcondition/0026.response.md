Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` and a string `strings`, then shifts each character in `strings` by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. It prints the resulting transformed string. However, if `n` is outside the range of 0 to 25 (not 26 as indicated), or if `strings` contains characters outside of the uppercase English letters, the function may produce unexpected behavior or errors, which are not handled in the current implementation. Additionally, if `strings` is empty, the function will simply print an empty string. **
