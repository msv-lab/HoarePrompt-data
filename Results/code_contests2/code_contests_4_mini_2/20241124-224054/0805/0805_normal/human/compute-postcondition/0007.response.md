The value of `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is `index + n`, where `index` is the position of `s` in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' and `n` is an input integer. Therefore, `new_index` will be the result of `(index + n) % 26`. The previous values of `added_index`, `index`, and `n` are not explicitly defined, but they exist in the context of the initial state.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `(index + n) % 26`**
