The value of `index` is assigned the position of `s` in the `letters` list. The initial state indicates that `added_index`, `new_index`, and `new_s` are already calculated based on the previous value of `index`. However, the previous value of `s` is not provided, so the exact value of `index` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the value of `index` is now determined based on the position of `s` in `letters`.

Output State: **`added_index` is updated to `index + 1 + n`, `new_index` is `(index + 1 + n) % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[(index + 1 + n + 1) % 26]`, `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`, and `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`**.
