The variable `new_s` is added to `new_strings`. The value of `new_s` is derived from `letters[new_index]`, where `new_index` is calculated as `(index + n) % 26`. The value of `added_index` is `index + n`, but it is not directly affected by this operation. The states of the other variables are not changed. Therefore, the output state is: `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `(index + n) % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `(index + n) % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`**
