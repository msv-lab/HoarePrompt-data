Output State: **`new_strings` is the result of shifting each character in `strings` by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. If `strings` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `new_strings` remains an empty string. If `N` is outside the defined range (0 <= N <= 26), it should be handled to avoid unexpected behavior, but in the current logic, it's assumed to be within bounds.**
