The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The previous value of `added_index` is `index + n + 1`, but now it will be updated to `index + n`. The states of `new_index`, `new_s`, `new_strings`, and `index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `added_index` is updated to `index + n`, `new_index` is `(index + n + 1) % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[(index + n + 1) % 26]`, `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`, and `index` is assigned the value of `letters.index(s)`.

Output State: **`added_index` is updated to `index + n`, `new_index` is `(index + n + 1) % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[(index + n + 1) % 26]`, `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`, and `index` is assigned the value of `letters.index(s)`**.
