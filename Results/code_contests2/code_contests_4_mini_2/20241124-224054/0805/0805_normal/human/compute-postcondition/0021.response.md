The code appends `new_s` to `new_strings`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `new_s` is the value assigned from `letters[new_index]`, and `new_index` is calculated from `added_index % 26`. The state of `new_strings` changes to include `new_s`, but the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`.**
