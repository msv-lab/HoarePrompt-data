The value of `new_index` is reassigned to `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is previously defined as `index + n`. Therefore, `new_index` is updated based on the modulo operation applied to `added_index`. The output state reflects that `new_index` is now the result of this calculation, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[(index + 1 + n + 1) % 26]`, `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`**
