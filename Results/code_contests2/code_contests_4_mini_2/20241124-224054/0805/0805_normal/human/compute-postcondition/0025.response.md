The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `S`. `N` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq N \leq 26\), and `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10,000. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept a non-negative integer `N` and a string `S` containing uppercase English letters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter N (a non-negative integer between 0 and 26) and S (a string of uppercase English letters between 1 and 10,000 characters long), but the return value is not specified.**
