The variable `new_strings` is assigned an empty string. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables: `N`, `S`, `n`, `strings`, and `letters`. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10,000; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is an input string; `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'; `new_strings` is an empty string.
