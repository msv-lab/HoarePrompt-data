The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The value of `index` is determined by the position of `s` in `letters`, which is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. Since `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `n` is also a non-negative integer input, the resulting `added_index` will be the sum of the index of `s` and the integer `n`. 

The output state reflects that the value of `added_index` will depend on the values of `index` (the position of `s` in the alphabet) and `n` (the input integer). 

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`, where `index` is the position of `s` in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' and `n` is an input integer.**
