The variable `new_strings` is updated to include the value of `new_s`. The previous value of `new_strings` is unknown, but it will now contain `new_s` appended to it. The other variables' states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `added_index` is updated to `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[(index + n + 1) % 26]`, and `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`.

Output State: **`added_index` is updated to `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[(index + n + 1) % 26]`, and `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`.**
