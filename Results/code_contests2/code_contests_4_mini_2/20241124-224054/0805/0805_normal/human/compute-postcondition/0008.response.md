The variable `new_s` is assigned the value from the `letters` array at the position `new_index`. The value of `new_index` is `(index + n) % 26`, and `added_index` is `index + n`. The output state will reflect the values of `added_index`, `new_index`, and `new_s`. However, since we don't have the specific values for `index`, `n`, or the contents of `letters`, we can only describe the relationships.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `(index + n) % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[new_index]`**
