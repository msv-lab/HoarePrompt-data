Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to shift each character in the string `S` by integer `N` in alphabetical order. It handles the wrap-around from 'Z' to 'A' properly using the modulus operation with 26. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:
- It reads an integer `N` and a string `S` from input.
- It initializes a string of uppercase letters for indexing.
- For each character in `S`, it finds the current index in the string of letters, adds `N` to it, and calculates the new index using the modulus operator to ensure it wraps around after 'Z'.
- It builds a new string with the shifted characters and prints it.

The program correctly handles:
- Cases where `N` is 0 (no shift).
- Cases where `N` is 26 (full rotation).
- Cases where characters wrap around the alphabet.

I cannot find any potential case where the program fails to meet the problem description, confirming its correctness.
