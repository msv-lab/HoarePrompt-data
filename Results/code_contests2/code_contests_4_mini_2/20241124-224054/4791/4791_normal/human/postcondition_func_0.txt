The function accepts no parameters, attempts to read an integer input `n`, and if `n` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 1, it prints the value 1 for each iteration of the loop. However, due to a type error, it fails to properly execute if the input is not converted to an integer first, which needs to be addressed.
