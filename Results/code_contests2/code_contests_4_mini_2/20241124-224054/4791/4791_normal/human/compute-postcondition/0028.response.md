According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2 to ensure that `j` can be incremented to 3 and still be less than `n`. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2**
