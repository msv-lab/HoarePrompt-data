According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which will make `j` equal to 2. Since `n` is already 2, the condition for the loop (`j < n`) will no longer hold true in the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 2 to allow for another iteration. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1**
