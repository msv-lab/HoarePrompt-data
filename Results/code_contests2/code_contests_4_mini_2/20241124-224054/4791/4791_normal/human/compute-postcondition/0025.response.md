The code prints the result of the expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. 

1. First, we calculate `j + 1`, where `j` is 1. So, `j + 1` equals 2.
2. Next, we convert 2 to its binary representation using `bin(2)`, which gives us the string `'0b10'`.
3. We then reverse this string with `[::-1]`, resulting in `'01b0'`.
4. We use `.find('1')` to locate the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. It finds '1' at index 1.
5. Finally, we add 1 to this index, resulting in `1 + 1`, which equals 2.

The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged, so the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the printed value is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the printed value is 2**
