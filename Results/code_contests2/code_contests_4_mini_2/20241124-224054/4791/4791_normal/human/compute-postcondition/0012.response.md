According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since it is given that `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `j` would be `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `j` must start at 0 and increment with each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. 

State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 0**
