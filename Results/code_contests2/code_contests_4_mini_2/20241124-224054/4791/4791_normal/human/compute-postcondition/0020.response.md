According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. The condition `while n:` indicates that the loop will continue executing as long as `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, since the loop executes `n` times, after the loop, `j` will be `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 0.

Since `j` takes values from 0 to `n - 1` and the loop has executed `n` times, we need to ensure that `n` is incremented to allow for another iteration. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is n - 1**
