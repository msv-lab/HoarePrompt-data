The expression inside the print statement calculates the position of the least significant '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 0, we first calculate `j + 1`, which is 1. The binary representation of 1 is `'1'`. 

Next, we reverse the string representation of the binary number, which gives us `'1'`. We then find the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is at index 0. Finally, we add 1 to this index, resulting in a value of 1.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, and the printed output is 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, and the printed output is 1**
