The statement `n -= 1` decrements the value of `n` by 1. Since `n` is an input string, the operation will result in an error because you cannot perform arithmetic operations on strings. The value of `N` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and an error occurs while trying to decrement `n`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and an error occurs while trying to decrement `n`**.
