The code snippet calculates the position of the least significant '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 1, the value of `j + 1` is 2. The binary representation of 2 is '10'. The reversed binary string is '01', and the first occurrence of '1' is at index 1. The code adds 1 to this index, resulting in a final value of 2.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2**
