Output State: **If `n` is at least 2, the loop will execute `n` times, where `j` will take values from 0 to `n-1`, and the output of the print statement will always be 1 for each iteration. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute, and `j` will not be defined, while `N` remains an integer between 2 and 500.**
