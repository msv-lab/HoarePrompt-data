The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts input from the user and stores it as a string. The previous value of `N` is not directly affected as it remains an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), but `n` will now hold a new string value. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and `n` is an input string**
