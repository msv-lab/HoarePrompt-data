Output State: **The loop executes `n` times, where `j` takes values from 0 to `n-1`. The printed output for each iteration corresponds to the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once, printing the values from 1 to the first non-zero value in the binary representation of `j + 1`. If `n` is 0 or negative (not applicable since `n` is at least 1), the loop does not execute, but this case does not occur here. Thus, after the loop, `j` will be `n - 1`.**
