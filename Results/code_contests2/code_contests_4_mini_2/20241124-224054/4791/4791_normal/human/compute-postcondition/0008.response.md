According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3, and `n` must remain greater than 3 (since `n` being greater than 2 does not guarantee another iteration).

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3, and the output of the print statement is 1**
