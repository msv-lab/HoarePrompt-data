Output State: **For `n` greater than 0, the loop executes `n` times, with `j` taking values from 0 to `n-1`. The printed values correspond to the positions of the least significant bit set to 1 in the binary representation of `j + 1`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, leaving `j` undefined and no output is generated.**
