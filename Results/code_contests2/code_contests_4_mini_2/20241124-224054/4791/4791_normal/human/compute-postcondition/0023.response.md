The expression `j + 1` calculates the value `0 + 1`, which is `1`. The binary representation of `1` is `'1'`. Reversing it gives the same string `'1'`. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string, which is at index `0`. Adding `1` results in `0 + 1`, which equals `1`. 

The states of `n` and `j` are not altered. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the print statement outputs `1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the print statement outputs 1**
