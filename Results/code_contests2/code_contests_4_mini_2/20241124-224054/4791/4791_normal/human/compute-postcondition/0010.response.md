According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `n` is non-zero (truthy). At the end of the last iteration, if `n` is at least 2, the loop will execute `n` times. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute again. 

Since the task specifies that `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, and given that the loop is intended to execute while `n` is truthy, we need to ensure that `n` remains greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` must remain greater than 0. Since the state mentions that `n` is at least 2, it is valid for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the current state of `n` as it already allows the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is at least 2**
