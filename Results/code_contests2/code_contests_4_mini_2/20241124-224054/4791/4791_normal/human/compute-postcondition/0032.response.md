The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that the integer `N` is between 2 and 500 (inclusive). Based on this constraint, the function will produce an output that is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot specify what the function returns. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with an integer N that is between 2 and 500 (inclusive), but the output of the function is not defined.**
