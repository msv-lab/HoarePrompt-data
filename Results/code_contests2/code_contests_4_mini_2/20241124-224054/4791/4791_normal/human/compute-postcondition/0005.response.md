The code calculates the position of the least significant '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Here, `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2. The binary representation of 2 is '10'. Reversing this gives '01', and finding the index of '1' in '01' results in 1 (the index starts from 0, so we add 1 to it). The print statement outputs this value. 

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is 2, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is 2, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 1**
