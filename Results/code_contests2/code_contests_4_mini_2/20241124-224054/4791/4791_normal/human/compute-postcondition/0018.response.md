According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which means it should become 2. Since `n` is at least 2, the condition for the loop to run again is satisfied.

Thus, the updated states should reflect that `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
