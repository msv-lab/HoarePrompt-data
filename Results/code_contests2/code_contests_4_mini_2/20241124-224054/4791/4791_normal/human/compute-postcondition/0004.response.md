According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 1 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged at 2 since it is not modified during the loop.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is 2, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 1**
