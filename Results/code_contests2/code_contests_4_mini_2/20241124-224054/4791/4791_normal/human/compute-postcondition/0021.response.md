The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, the new value of `n` will be `n - 1`, and `j`, which was assigned the previous value of `n - 1`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 1` (before decrementing `n`).

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 1`**
