According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. The loop variable `j` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the value of `j` should be adjusted to 0, which is the initial value of `j` at the start of the loop. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
