The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and then adds 1 to that position. 

1. The value of `j` is 2.
2. Calculate `j + 1`: 
   - `2 + 1 = 3`.
3. Convert `3` to binary: 
   - `bin(3)` gives `'0b11'`.
4. Reverse this string (excluding the `'0b'` prefix):
   - Reversing `'11'` gives `'11'`.
5. Find the index of the first occurrence of '1':
   - `'11'.find('1')` returns `0` (the index of the first '1').
6. Add `1` to this index:
   - `0 + 1 = 1`.

The print statement outputs `1`, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1**.
