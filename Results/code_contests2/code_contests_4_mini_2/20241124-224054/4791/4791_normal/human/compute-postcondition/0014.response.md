According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1, and `n` must still be at least 1. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect the new value of `j`.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 1**
