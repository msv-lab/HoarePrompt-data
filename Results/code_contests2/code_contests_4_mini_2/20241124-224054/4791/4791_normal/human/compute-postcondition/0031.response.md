Output State: **If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute `n` times, and for each iteration of `j` (from 0 to `n-1`), it will print the value 1, since the binary representation of `j + 1` will always have the least significant bit set at position 1. After the loop completes, `n` will be decremented to `n - 1`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, leaving `n` unchanged. Therefore, if `n` is at least 1, `n` will be decremented to 0 after the loop, and the output will be 1 printed `n` times; if `n` is less than 1 initially, the loop does not execute and `n` remains unchanged.**
