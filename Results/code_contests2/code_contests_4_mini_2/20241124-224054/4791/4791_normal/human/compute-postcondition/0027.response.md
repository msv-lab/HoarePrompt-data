The code snippet calculates the position of the least significant '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, we calculate `j + 1` which is 3. The binary representation of 3 is `11`. Reversing this string gives `11`, and the `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is 0. Adding 1 to this index gives us 1.

Thus, the printed value will be 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the printed value of `j` is still 2. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and the printed value is 1**
