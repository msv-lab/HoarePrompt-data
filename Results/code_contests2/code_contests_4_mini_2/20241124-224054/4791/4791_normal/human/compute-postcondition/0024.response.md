According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Thus, after this iteration, `j` would be 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, it does not need to be adjusted to allow for another iteration; however, it must be ensured that `n` remains greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
