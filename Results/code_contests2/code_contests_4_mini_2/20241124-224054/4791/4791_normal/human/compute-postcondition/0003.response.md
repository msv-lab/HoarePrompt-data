The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` is executed. 

1. The current value of `j` is 0.
2. Therefore, `j + 1` equals 1.
3. The binary representation of 1 is `0b1`, which when converted to a string after removing the `0b` prefix is `'1'`.
4. Reversing this string results in `'1'`.
5. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string `'1'`, which is at index 0.
6. Finally, adding 1 to this index gives a result of `0 + 1 = 1`.

The output does not change any of the variable states. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is 2, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1**.
