To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code step by step:

1. The value of `j` is given as `1`.
2. We compute `j + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.
3. We convert `2` to its binary representation using `bin(2)`, which results in the string `'0b10'`.
4. We then reverse this string (excluding the `'0b'` prefix), yielding `'01'`.
5. Next, we use `.find('1')` to locate the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string `'01'`, which is at index `1`.
6. We add `1` to this index, resulting in `1 + 1 = 2`.

The other variable `n` is not directly affected by this operation since it remains at least `1`. 

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is at least 1; the output of the print statement is 2**
