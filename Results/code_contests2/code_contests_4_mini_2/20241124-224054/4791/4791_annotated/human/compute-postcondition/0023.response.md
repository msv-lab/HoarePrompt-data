The value of `j` is 0. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to 1. The binary representation of 1 is `'0b1'`, and when we slice it with `bin(j + 1)[::-1]`, we get `'1b0'`. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of '1' in this reversed string, which is at index 0. Adding 1 to this index gives us a final result of 1.

The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the result of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the print statement outputs 1**
