According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is 2, the loop will execute twice (with `j` taking values 0 and 1). If `n` is greater than 2, it will execute `n-1` times (with `j` taking values from 0 to `n-2`).

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `n` is at least 1. Since `n` was either 2 or greater than 2 (which is then decremented by 1), it will either be 2 or at least 2 after decrementing, thus ensuring it is 1 or more. Additionally, `j` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0**
