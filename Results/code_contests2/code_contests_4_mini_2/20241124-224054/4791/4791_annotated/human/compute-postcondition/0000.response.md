The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input from the user. Since `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), the value of `n` will be a string representation of the input. The previous value of `N` does not change, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string**
