According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero (i.e., greater than 0), the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, which means it is positive, so the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments. The loop condition `while n:` indicates that as long as `n` is non-zero, the loop will continue.

Since `n` remains unchanged, and `j` is not defined until the loop executes, there are no states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is undefined**
