The code calculates `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. Here, `j` is 2, so `j + 1` equals 3. The binary representation of 3 is `11`. Reversing this string gives `11`, and finding the index of the first occurrence of '1' gives `0`. Adding 1 results in `1`. 

The values of the other variables (`n` and `result`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `result` is 2, and the print statement outputs 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `result` is 2, and the print statement outputs 1**
