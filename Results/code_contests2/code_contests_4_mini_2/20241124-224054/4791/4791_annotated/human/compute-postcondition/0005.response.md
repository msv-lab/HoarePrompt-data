The code computes `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. The value of `j` is 1, so we first calculate `j + 1`, which equals 2. The binary representation of 2 is `10`. Reversing this string gives us `01`. The `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string, which is at index 1. Adding 1 to this index results in 2. The other variables `N` and `n` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 2**
