According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1 at the start of the next iteration, while `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `j` is 1**
