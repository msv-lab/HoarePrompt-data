According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `j` is undefined before the loop starts, but it will be defined during the loop execution starting from 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to state that `n` is greater than 0 and that `j` will start at 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
