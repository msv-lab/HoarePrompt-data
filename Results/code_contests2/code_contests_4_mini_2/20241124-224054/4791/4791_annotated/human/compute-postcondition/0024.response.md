According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute at least once more. 

To execute one more time, we need to adjust `j` to reflect the next iteration. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 before checking the condition again, `j` should be adjusted to 1. The state of `n` does not need to change because it is still greater than 0 to allow further iterations.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
