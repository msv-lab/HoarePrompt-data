According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, which means the loop can execute again. 

To determine the states for the next iteration:
- Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the next iteration, `j` will become 1.
- The value of `n` does not need to change as it is already greater than or equal to 1.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `j` becomes 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
