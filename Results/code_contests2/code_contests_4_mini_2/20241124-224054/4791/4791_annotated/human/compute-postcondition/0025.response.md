The expression `j + 1` is evaluated, where `j` is 1, so `j + 1` is 2. The binary representation of 2 is `10`. The string `10` is then reversed, resulting in `01`. The method `.find('1')` is called on this reversed string, which returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is 1. Finally, 1 is added to this index, yielding 2.

The values of the other variables, `n` in particular, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the result is 2**
