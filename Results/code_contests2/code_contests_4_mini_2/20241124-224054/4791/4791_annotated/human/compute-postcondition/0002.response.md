According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be an integer, as it is used in the range function. However, the provided state indicates that `n` is a string, which causes an error when attempting to decrement it. To ensure the loop can execute, `n` needs to be an integer value within the defined range. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments include changing `n` from a string to an integer and ensuring it is within the specified boundaries. The loop variable `j` will start at 0 based on the range function.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `j` is 0**
