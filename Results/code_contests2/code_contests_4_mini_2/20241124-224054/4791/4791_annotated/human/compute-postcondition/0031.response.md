Output State: **If `n` is a valid integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), then the loop will execute `n` times, decrementing `n` each time until it reaches 0. During each iteration, `j` will take values from 0 to `n-1`, and the printed values will be the positions of the least significant '1' in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to `n`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and the values of `N` and `n` remain unchanged. After the loop finishes, `n` will be 0, and `j` will be undefined.**
