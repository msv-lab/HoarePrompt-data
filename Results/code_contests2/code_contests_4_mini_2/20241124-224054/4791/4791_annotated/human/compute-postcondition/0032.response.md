The function `func` accepts a parameter `N`, which is an integer constrained between 2 and 500 (inclusive). The output of the function is not defined in the provided information, so we cannot specify any return values or cases. Therefore, based on the given parameters and constraints, we can conclude the following:

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter N, which is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). The return value of the function is not specified.**
