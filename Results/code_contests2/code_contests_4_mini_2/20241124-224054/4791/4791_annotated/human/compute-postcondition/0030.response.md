According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is not zero (or lower). At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If `n` is currently 0 or lower, the loop cannot execute again. 

Since it is stated that `n` is at least 1 before the loop starts, but we don't have the exact value of `n` at the end of the last iteration, we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 0**
