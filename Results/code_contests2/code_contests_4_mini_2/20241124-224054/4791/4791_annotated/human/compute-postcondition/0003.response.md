The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` is executed. 

1. The value of `j` is 0, so `j + 1` equals 1.
2. The binary representation of 1 is `'0b1'`, and when sliced with `bin(j + 1)`, it results in `'0b1'`.
3. Reversing this string (excluding the '0b' prefix) gives us `'1'`.
4. The `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is 0.
5. Adding 1 to this value results in 0 + 1 = 1.

No other variables are affected in this operation. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1.**
