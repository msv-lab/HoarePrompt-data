The code calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`. The binary representation of `3` is `11`. When reversed, it becomes `11`, and the `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is `0`. Adding `1` gives `1`. 

The `print` statement outputs the value `1`, but it does not change the state of any variables defined initially. Therefore, the output state remains:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `j` is 2, the output of the print statement is 1**.
