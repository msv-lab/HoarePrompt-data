Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input from the user, which is expected to be between 2 and 500 (inclusive). It then enters a loop that decrements this integer until it reaches 0. During each iteration, it prints the position of the least significant '1' in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to `n-1`. If the input is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and no values are printed. There is no return value from the function. **
