According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3, so that `j` can be incremented to 3 and the loop can continue. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2**
