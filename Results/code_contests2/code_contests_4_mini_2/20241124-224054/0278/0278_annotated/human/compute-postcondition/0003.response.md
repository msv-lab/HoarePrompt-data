The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: an integer between 1 and 20.
- `V`: an integer between 1 and 10000.
- `a`: a list of `n` positive integers where each integer satisfies the condition (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100).
- `b`: a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer satisfies the condition (0 ≤ bi ≤ 100).

The output of the function is not explicitly provided in the prompt. However, based on typical operations involving such parameters, one might expect the function to perform some calculations or evaluations based on the lists `a` and `b`, potentially involving the values of `n` and `V`.

Since the specific output behavior is not defined, I will not speculate on the return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `V`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is an integer (1 to 20), `V` is an integer (1 to 10000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 to 100), and `b` is a list of `n` non-negative integers (0 to 100). The specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
