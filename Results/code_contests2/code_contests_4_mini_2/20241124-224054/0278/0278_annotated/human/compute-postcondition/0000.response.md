The code assigns values to `n` and `V` by reading input and converting it to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 20 and `V` is an integer between 1 and 10000, but the specific values of `n` and `V` are not provided. Other variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 20, `V` is an integer between 1 and 10000**
