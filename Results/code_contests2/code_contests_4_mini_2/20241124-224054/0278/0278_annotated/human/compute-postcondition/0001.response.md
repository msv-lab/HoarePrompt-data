The code assigns two lists to the variables `a` and `b`. Each list is created by taking input from the user, splitting it, and converting each split string into a float. The values of `n` and `V` are not directly affected by this code, but we know that `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, and `V` is an integer between 1 and 10000. The exact values of `a` and `b` depend on the input given by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 20, `V` is an integer between 1 and 10000, `a` is a list of floats from user input, `b` is a list of floats from user input**
