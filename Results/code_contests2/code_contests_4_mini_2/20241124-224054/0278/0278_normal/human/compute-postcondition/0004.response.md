Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `V`, along with two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. It calculates a minimum value based on the relationships between the elements of `a` and `b`, where `a` contains positive integers and `b` contains non-negative integers. The function prints the calculated minimum value based on the given inputs. However, it does not handle scenarios where the inputs might not conform to the expected types or ranges, such as invalid input formats or empty lists. **
