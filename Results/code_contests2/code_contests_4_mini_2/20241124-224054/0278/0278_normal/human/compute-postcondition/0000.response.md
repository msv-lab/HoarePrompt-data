The values of `n` and `V` are assigned from the input received through `raw_input()`, which is split and converted to integers. The previous values of `n` and `V` are not known, but they must satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 and 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000. Other variables `a` and `b` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000; `a` is a list of n positive integers; `b` is a list of n non-negative integers.**
