To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the code and check if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have five players, each starting with a positive number of coins `b` (the initial bet).
2. After some operations (passing coins), the players end up with certain amounts of coins `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5`.
3. We need to figure out the initial bet `b` or determine if it's impossible to achieve the given end amounts.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    s = sum(c)
    print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads five integers from input, which represent the number of coins each player has at the end.
2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total number of coins with `s = sum(c)`.
3. **Condition to Determine `b`**:
   - If `s` is 0, it prints `-1`. This is correct because if all players have 0 coins, they couldn't have made any initial bet.
   - If `s` is not divisible by 5 (the number of players), it prints `-1`. This is also correct because if the total coins can't be evenly distributed among the players, then no equal initial bet `b` can exist.
   - Otherwise, it computes `b` as `s / 5`.

### Edge Cases:
- If all players have zero coins (input: `0 0 0 0 0`), the output should be `-1`, which is correctly handled.
- If the total number of coins is not a multiple of 5, the output should also be `-1`.

### Potential Issues:
The program doesn't directly check if `b` is a positive integer. The only requirement for `b` to be valid is that `s` should be divisible by 5 and `s` should not be zero. However, the program assumes that if `s` is divisible by 5, the result of `s / 5` will be positive, which is not guaranteed if all players end up with fewer coins than their initial bet.

### Test Case to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the input `1 1 1 1 1`. The total is `5`, and `5 / 5` gives `1`, which is correct.
Now consider the case where players could end up with zero coins after passing coins around, like `0 0 0 0 5`. The output would be `1` (since `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 5`, and `5 / 5 = 1`), but that would indicate that each player initially bet `1` coin, which is impossible because four players have `0` coins.

### Conclusion:
The program fails in cases where some players have `0` coins and others have non-zero amounts, leading to an invalid result for `b`.

Correctness: **False**
