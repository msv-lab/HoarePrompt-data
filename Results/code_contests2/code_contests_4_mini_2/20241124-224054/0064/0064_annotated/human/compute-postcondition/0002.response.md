To analyze the code snippet given the initial state:

1. **Understanding the Variables**: 
   - `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are non-negative integers representing coins. 
   - `s` is the sum of these coins, which can be expressed as `s = c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5`.

2. **Code Behavior**:
   - The expression checks if `s` equals 0. If it does, it will print `-1`.
   - If `s` is not 0, it checks whether `s` is divisible by the number of coin types, which is `len(c)`. Here, `len(c)` is 5 since there are 5 coin variables.
   - If `s % len(c) != 0`, it will again print `-1`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied (i.e., `s` is greater than 0 and divisible by 5), it will print `s / len(c)`.

3. **Impact on Program**:
   - Depending on the values of the coins, we will determine the value of `s` and the output based on the conditions stated above.
   - The output will be based on the checks performed.

Since the specific values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` (and thus `s`) are not provided, we will describe the output state depending on the conditions.

Output State: **If `s` is 0, output is -1; if `s % 5 != 0`, output is -1; otherwise, output is `s / 5`.**
