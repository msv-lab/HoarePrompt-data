The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with five non-negative integers, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`, representing the number of coins each of the five players has at the end of the game, where 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100. The function's output is based on these values. 

Since the specific output is not provided in the task, we cannot define the cases or return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function can only be described in terms of what it accepts and the general nature of its output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with five non-negative integers representing the number of coins each of the five players has at the end of the game.**
