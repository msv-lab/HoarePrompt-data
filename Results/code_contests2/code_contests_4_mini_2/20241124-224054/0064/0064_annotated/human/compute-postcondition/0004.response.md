Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and reads a line of input representing the number of coins each of five players has. It calculates the sum of these coins and checks if the sum is zero or if the sum is not divisible by the number of players (five). If either condition is true, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the average number of coins per player. This implies that the function can handle cases where the total number of coins is zero or not evenly distributed among the players.**
