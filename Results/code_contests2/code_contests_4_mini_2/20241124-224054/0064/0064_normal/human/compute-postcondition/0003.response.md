The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints that c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers, each ranging from 0 to 100. The function returns different outputs based on the values of these integers. 

Given that the specifics of the return values based on those integers are not provided in the output, we cannot detail the exact nature of those outputs. However, we can summarize the constraints under which the function operates.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the internal integers c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5, which are non-negative integers constrained between 0 and 100. The exact return values depend on these integers but are not specified.**
