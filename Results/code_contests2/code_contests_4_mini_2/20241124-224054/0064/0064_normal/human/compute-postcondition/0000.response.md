The code assigns values to `c` by using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes user input, splits it, and converts each part to an integer. The values assigned to `c` will depend on the user input, but it will produce a sequence of integers. The initial state of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` remains unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`, along with the new variable `c` which holds the mapped integer values from the input.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` ≤ 100; `c` holds the integer values from user input**.
