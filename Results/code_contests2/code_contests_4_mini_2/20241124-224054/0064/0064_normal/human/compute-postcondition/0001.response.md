The variable `s` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the iterable `c`. The specific values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are not provided, but they are non-negative integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, `s` will be the sum of these integers, which can range from 0 (if all are 0) to 500 (if all are 100). The output state summarizes the values of `c` and the resulting sum `s`.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` ≤ 100; `s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`, and can range from 0 to 500.**
