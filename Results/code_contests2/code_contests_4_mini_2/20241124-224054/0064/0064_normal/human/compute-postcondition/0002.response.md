To analyze the code, we need to consider the initial state. The variables `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are non-negative integers within the range of 0 to 100. The variable `s` is defined as the sum of these five integers, ranging from 0 to 500.

1. The code checks if `s` equals 0. If it does, the output will be -1.
2. If `s` is not 0, the code then checks if `s` is divisible by the length of the list `c`, which contains the values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`. The length of `c` is 5.
3. If `s` is divisible by 5, the output will be the result of `s / 5`.
4. If `s` is not divisible by 5, the output will also be -1.

Let's summarize the possible outcomes based on the value of `s`:

- If `s == 0`: Output -1
- If `s > 0` and `s % 5 == 0`: Output `s / 5`
- If `s > 0` and `s % 5 != 0`: Output -1

Since the values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are not specified, we can't compute a specific numeric value for `s`. Therefore, the output state will depend on the value of `s` derived from the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are non-negative integers; if `s == 0`, print -1; if `s > 0` and `s % 5 == 0`, print `s / 5`; if `s > 0` and `s % 5 != 0`, print -1.**
