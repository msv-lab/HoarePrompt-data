Functionality: ** The function reads a sequence of integers from user input, calculates the sum of these integers, and then checks the following conditions: if the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of integers, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the average of the integers. The function does not accept any parameters and relies entirely on user input for its operation.**
