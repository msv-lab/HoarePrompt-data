The provided program is supposed to find the n-th even-length positive palindrome number. However, the code does not seem to relate at all to the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `n`, processes it to remove non-alphabetic characters, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome. This is entirely unrelated to finding even-length positive palindrome numbers based on an integer input.

The expected output should be the n-th even-length palindrome number, which is a numerical value. The function does not accept an integer input, nor does it generate or return any palindrome numbers. Instead, it operates on a string and checks for palindromic properties of that string. 

Output hints describe functionality that is not relevant to the problem at hand. They indicate that the function processes strings and checks for palindrome properties, which has no connection to the task of finding even-length palindromes based on an integer input.

For example, the first even-length palindrome is 11, and the second is 22, which the function does not compute at all. 

Given these observations, the program does not follow the problem description for any case.

Correctness: **False**.
