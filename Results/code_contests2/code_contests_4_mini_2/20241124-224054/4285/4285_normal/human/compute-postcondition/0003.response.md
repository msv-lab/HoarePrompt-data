The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be a string. It processes this string by filtering out any non-alphabetic characters and converting all remaining characters to lowercase. The function then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards. The function returns `True` if the processed string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

It's important to note that the function does not accept a positive integer as stated in the annotations; instead, it operates on a string input. Additionally, if the input is an empty string or contains only non-alphabetic characters, it will return `True` since an empty string is considered a palindrome.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `n`, processes it to remove non-alphabetic characters and convert it to lowercase, and returns `True` if the resulting string is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `False`. **
