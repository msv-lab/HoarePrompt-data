The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be a string. It processes the string by converting all alphabetic characters to lowercase and concatenates them into a new string `x`. The function then checks if `x` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`x[::-1]`). 

The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is not a string or is an empty input; however, if `n` is an empty string, the resulting `x` will also be an empty string, which will return `True` since an empty string is a palindrome.

The annotations incorrectly state that `n` is a positive integer, which it is not. Moreover, the function does not specify behavior for non-alphabetic string inputs or mixtures of characters, which means it will ignore non-alphabetic characters without raising an error.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `n`, processes it to remove non-alphabetic characters and convert it to lowercase, and returns True if the resulting string is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns False. If `n` is an empty string, it returns True as an empty string is considered a palindrome. **
