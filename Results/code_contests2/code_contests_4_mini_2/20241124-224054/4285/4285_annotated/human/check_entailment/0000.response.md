Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem description correctly. The problem requires generating the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, while the provided code checks if a given string is a palindrome. The functionality is completely unrelated to the requirements of the problem.

For example, if the input is `1`, the expected output should be `11`, but the program will not produce this output because it is not designed to generate even-length palindromes.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements laid out in the problem description, demonstrating that it is incorrect.
