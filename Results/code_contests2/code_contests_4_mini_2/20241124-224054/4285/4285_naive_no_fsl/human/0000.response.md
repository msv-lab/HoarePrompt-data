Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem description at all. The problem is asking for a function that computes the n-th even-length palindrome number, but the given code is instead performing a check to see if a string (assumed to be containing alphabetic characters) is a palindrome. 

For example, if we input `1`, we expect the output to be `11` (the first even-length palindrome), but the program is not designed to handle integer inputs or generate palindrome numbers at all. 

Since the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, it is incorrect.
