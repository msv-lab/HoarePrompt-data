Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not implement the required functionality to find the n-th even-length palindrome number. Instead, it attempts to check if a given input is a palindrome by filtering out alphabetic characters, which is unrelated to the problem description. 

For example, if we input `1`, the expected output should be `11`, but the current implementation does not handle input in this manner at all. It will produce an error or an irrelevant result. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
