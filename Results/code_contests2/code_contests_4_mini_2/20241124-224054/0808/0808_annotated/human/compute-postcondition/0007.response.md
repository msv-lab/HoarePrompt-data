According to the code, the loop will execute again if the variable `j` can take on another value in the specified range. The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` each time, continuing as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is equal to `i` (since `j` is set to `i`).
- The starting point for `j` in the loop is `i ** 2 - 1`, and it continues while `j < 1000000`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `j` to the next value after the last one, which will be `j + i`.

Since `j` is currently equal to `i`:
- The next value of `j` will be `i + i = 2 * i`.

For the loop to execute again, `2 * i` must be less than 1,000,000. Therefore, the condition on `n` must ensure that this is possible.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` (which is equal to `i`) must satisfy:
- `2 * i < 1000000` implies `i < 500000`.

Thus, `n` can remain unchanged since it is already guaranteed that `1 ≤ i ≤ n` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 999999`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999999; `i` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `i` < 500000; `j` is `2 * i`; and `a[j]` is set to False.**
