Output State: **If `i` is between 1 and 999, then the loop will execute as long as `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000. After executing, `j` will take values starting from `i` and incremented by `i` each iteration, setting `a[j]` to `False` for each value of `j`. If `i` is 999 or greater, the loop will not execute since `i ** 2 - 1` will be greater than or equal to 999,999. In such cases, `j` will not be defined, and `a` remains unchanged.**
