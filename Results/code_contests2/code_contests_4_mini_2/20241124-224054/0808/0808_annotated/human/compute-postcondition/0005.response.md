According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than 1,000,000. The loop starts at `j = i ** 2 - 1` and increments `j` by `i` in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i ** 2 - 1 + i = i ** 2 + i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Therefore, we need to ensure that:

1. The next value of `j`, which is `i ** 2 + i - 1`, must be less than 1,000,000.
2. We need to set `j` to the next value, which is `i ** 2 + i - 1`.

Thus, we need the condition `i ** 2 + i < 1,000,000`. 

In summary, we adjust the state to ensure that `j` can take the next value in the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `i` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `j` is `i ** 2 + i - 1`, and `a[j]` is False**
