`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `j` is `2i`, where `i` is between 1 and 499,999. Therefore, `j` can take values between 2 and 999,998. The state of `n` is not directly affected by this assignment, but it is noted that `1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999`. The output state reflects the updated state of `a[j]` without changing the values of `n`, `i`, or other variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is between 1 and 499,999; `j` is `2i`; `a[j]` is set to False**
