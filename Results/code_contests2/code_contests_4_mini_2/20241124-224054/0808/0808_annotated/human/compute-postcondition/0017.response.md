According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, and `a[j]` is set to `False`. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to calculate the next value of `j` based on the current value of `i`. The next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is `i + i` or `2i`.

Next, we need to verify the conditions for the loop to execute one more time. Since `j` is currently `i` and will be updated to `2i`, we need to ensure that `2i` is still less than 1,000,000. 

Thus, to guarantee the loop can execute again:
- `2i` must be less than 1,000,000, which means `i` must be less than 500,000.
- The variable `j` should be updated to `2i`.

Therefore, the values need to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` needs to be updated to `2i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is between 1 and 499,999; `j` is `2i`; `a[j]` is set to `False`**
