According to the code, the loop will execute for each integer `i` starting from 2 up to 999,999. The condition for executing the loop is that `i` must be less than 1,000,000. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the next integer. 

If `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will increment to 3 in the next iteration. If `i` was 999,999, the loop would not execute again as it would exceed the upper limit.

Assuming the current value of `i` is less than 999,999, we would adjust `i` to be the next integer (i.e., `i + 1`), and since we have no information on the state of `a`, we do not need to adjust `a` as the loop's condition is based solely on `i`.

Therefore, the state will reflect `i` incremented by one.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is incremented by 1**
