The code `a[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `j` of the list or array `a`. The variable `j` is equal to `i`, which is between 1 and 999. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 999,999, but it does not affect the operation of this line of code. 

Assuming `a` is a list with at least `j` elements, the specific value of `a[j]` is changed to `False`. Other variables `n` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is between 1 and 999; `j` is `i`, and `a[j]` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is between 1 and 999; `j` is `i`; `a[j]` is set to `False`**
