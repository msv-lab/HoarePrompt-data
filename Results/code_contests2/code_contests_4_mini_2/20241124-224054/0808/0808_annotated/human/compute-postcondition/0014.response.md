The value of `j` is assigned the value of `i`. The code then sets the element at index `j` in the list `a` to `False`. Since `i` is between 1 and 999, `j` will also be within the same range. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is between 1 and 999; `j` is `i`; and `a[j]` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is between 1 and 999; `j` is `i`; and `a[j]` is set to `False**
