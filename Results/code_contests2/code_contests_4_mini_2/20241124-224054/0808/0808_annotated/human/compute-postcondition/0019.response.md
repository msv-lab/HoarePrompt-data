According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and the range defined in the `for` loop. The loop starts with `j` at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments `j` by `i` each iteration, continuing while `j` is less than 1,000,000.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is `2i` (as given).
- The loop's condition is `j < 1000000`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. The next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is `2i + i = 3i`.
2. To ensure the loop executes, `3i` must be less than 1,000,000.

Given that `i` is between 1 and 499,999, we can deduce:
- If `j = 2i`, then for the next iteration, we need `3i < 1000000`.
- This implies `i` must be less than approximately 333,333.33, so the maximum integer value for `i` can be 333,333.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be less than or equal to 333,333 for the loop to execute one more time.
- `j` should be adjusted to `3i` to reflect the next value in the series.

Therefore, the adjusted state would be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is less than or equal to 333,333; `j` is 3i; `a[j]` is set to False**
