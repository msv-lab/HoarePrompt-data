Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999. If `a[i - 1]` is True, the loop sets the values of `a` at indices from `i^2 - 1` to 999,999, incrementing by `i`, to False. If `i` is 2, the indices will include all even numbers starting from 3, marking them as False. If `i` is greater than 2, only the multiples of `i` starting from `i^2 - 1` will be set to False. If `a[i - 1]` is False, no changes are made to the list `a`.***
