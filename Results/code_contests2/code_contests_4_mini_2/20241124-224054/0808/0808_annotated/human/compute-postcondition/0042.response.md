The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates based on the constraints that the integer `n` must satisfy, specifically that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, and there are at most 30 datasets to consider. The function processes the input according to these constraints and produces an output based on the logic defined within its body. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle multiple datasets, where each dataset involves an integer `n` that is constrained between 1 and 999,999, and the function returns results based on the processing of these datasets. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but processes up to 30 datasets, where each dataset contains an integer n constrained between 1 and 999,999.**
