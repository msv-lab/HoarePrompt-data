Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999 and `i` is incremented to the next value (up to 999,999). If `a[i - 1]` is True and `i` is at least 1 and less than or equal to 31, the array `a` will have `a[j]` set to False for all `j` values starting from `i^2 - 1` up to 999,999 in increments of `i`. If `a[i - 1]` is False or if `i` is less than 1 or greater than 31, the array `a` remains unchanged. The variable `j` takes values starting from `i^2 - 1` and increments by `i` for each iteration of the loop.***
