The statement `a[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `j` of the array `a`. The variable `j` is equal to `i`, which is between 1 and 31. Thus, the index `j` is valid for the array `a`, assuming it has at least `i` elements (i.e., `a` has at least 31 elements). The specific boolean value of `a[i - 1]` is not affected by this assignment, but the value at index `j` (which is `i`) in the array `a` is set to `False`. 

Since `a[j]` is assigned `False`, we can conclude that the state of `a` at index `j` is now `False`, but we do not have information on the other elements of `a`. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `a[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 31; `a[i - 1]` is still a boolean value; `j` is `i`; `a[j]` is False**
