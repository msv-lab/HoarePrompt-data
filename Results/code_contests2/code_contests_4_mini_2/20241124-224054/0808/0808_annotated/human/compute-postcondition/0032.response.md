According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` starting from 2 and going up to 999,999. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than 999,999. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented to the next value. Since `i` is incremented in the loop, we need to set `i` to the next value for the upcoming iteration. There is no adjustment needed for `n` since it is within the specified range. 

Given that `i` has already been incremented past the last value, we need to adjust `i` to the next valid value:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 999,999**
