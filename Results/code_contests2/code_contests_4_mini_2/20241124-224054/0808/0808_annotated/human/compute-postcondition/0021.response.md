Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1]` is True and `i` is between 1 and 999, then for each `j` in the range from `i^2 - 1` to 999,999 with a step of `i`, the corresponding entries in array `a` are set to False. If `a[i - 1]` is False, no changes are made to array `a`.***
