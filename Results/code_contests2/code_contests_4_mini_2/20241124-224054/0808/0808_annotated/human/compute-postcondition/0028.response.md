The code assigns the value `False` to `a[j]`, where `j` is `2i`. Given that `a[j]` is already `False`, there is no change in the state of `a[j]`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 31; `a[i - 1]` is still a boolean value; `j` is `2i`; `a[j]` is False**
