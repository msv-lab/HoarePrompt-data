The line `a[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `j` of the list `a`. The value of `j` is calculated as `2 * i`. Given that `i` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ i < 500000`, the range of `j` will be from `2` to `999998` (since the maximum value of `i` is `499999`). The initial state indicates that `a[j]` is set to `False`, which updates the specific index `j` in the array `a`. The states of `n` and `i` are unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999999; `i` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `i` < 500000; `j` is `2 * i`; `a[j]` is set to False.**
