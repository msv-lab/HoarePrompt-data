To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we first need to understand the context provided by the loop statement. The loop's range is defined as `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`, which means that it will start from `i ** 2 - 1` and continue up to (but not including) `1000000`, with a step size of `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999;
- `i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 31;
- `a[i - 1]` is a boolean value;
- `j` is equal to `i`;
- `a[j]` is set to False.

1. The starting point for the loop is `i ** 2 - 1`. The next value in the loop will be `i ** 2 - 1 + i`, and this continues until the loop would exceed or reach `1000000`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` (which is equal to `i`), needs to be such that `i ** 2 - 1 + i` is still less than `1000000`.

Since the loop has already executed once, we need to ensure that `j` is incremented appropriately for the next iteration. After the last iteration, `j` would have taken the value of the last computed value in the range. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to reflect the next value in the sequence.

The critical adjustment is that the new value of `j` will need to be `i ** 2 - 1 + i` for the next iteration.

Thus, the adjustments needed for the state are as follows:
- The value of `j` should be updated to `i ** 2 - 1 + i`.
- The boolean value `a[j]` should be set to False, as it was the last value processed in the loop.

Now, let's summarize the final state:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 31; `a[i - 1]` is still a boolean value; `j` is `i ** 2 - 1 + i`; `a[j]` is set to False.**
