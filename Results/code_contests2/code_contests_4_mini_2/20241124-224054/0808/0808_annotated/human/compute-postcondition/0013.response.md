According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will execute if the starting value `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000. Since `n` is given as an integer between 1 and 999,999, it does not directly affect the loop execution but rather provides a context for the variable `i`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to determine the value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before the loop starts, it must be at least 1 to start with. Therefore, the minimum value of `i` would be 1, which gives a starting value of `0` for `j`:

1. If `i = 1`, then `j` starts at `1 ** 2 - 1 = 0`, which is valid.
2. As `i` increases, the starting value for `j` will also increase (for example, if `i = 2`, then `j` starts at `3`, which is still valid).

However, if `i` is too large, it could result in `i ** 2 - 1` being equal to or greater than 1000000, preventing the loop from executing. The maximum value for `i` that allows the loop to execute is when `i ** 2 - 1 < 1000000`. 

Calculating the maximum integer `i`:
- `i ** 2 < 1000001`
- `i < √1000001 ≈ 1000`.

Thus, `i` can range from 1 to 999. 

To summarize, we need to ensure that:
- `i` is at least 1.
- The value of `i` must be such that `i ** 2 - 1 < 1000000`, which is true for `i` values from 1 up to 999.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop execution should be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is between 1 and 999, `j` is `i ** 2 - 1`**.
