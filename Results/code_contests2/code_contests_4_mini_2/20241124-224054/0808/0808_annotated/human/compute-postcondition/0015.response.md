To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we first need to analyze the current state and what is required for the loop to execute again.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

1. The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments `j` by `i` until it reaches or exceeds 1,000,000.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000 at the end of the last iteration.

Given the current state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999.
- `i` is between 1 and 999.
- `j` is equal to `i`.
- `a[j]` is set to `False`.

Since `j` is initialized to `i`, at the end of the last iteration, it would have incremented by `i` in each iteration. Therefore, to calculate the state we need for the next iteration, we need to adjust `j`.

The initial value of `j` is `i ** 2 - 1`. After the last iteration, it will be `j + i`, and we need to ensure that this new `j` is still less than 1,000,000.

To summarize:
- If `j` starts at `i ** 2 - 1`, we need to calculate the new `j` for the next iteration. If the current value of `j` had reached a value such that `j + i` is still less than 1,000,000, we will update `j` accordingly.
- Thus, we can state that for the next iteration, `j` should be the next value incremented by `i`.

Given the above reasoning, the necessary modifications to the state are:
- `j` will be the next value that is `i ** 2 - 1 + i`.

Thus, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is between 1 and 999; `j` is `i ** 2 - 1 + i`; and `a[j]` is set to `False`**
