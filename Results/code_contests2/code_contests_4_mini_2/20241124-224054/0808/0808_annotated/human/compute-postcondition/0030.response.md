Output State: **If `i` is at least 1 and less than or equal to 31, the loop will execute, setting `a[j]` to False for `j` values starting from `i^2 - 1` up to 999,999 in steps of `i`. If `i` is less than 1 or greater than 31, the loop does not execute, and `a` remains unchanged. `j` will take values starting from `i^2 - 1`, `j` will be equal to `i^2 - 1 + k*i` for k = 0, 1, ... for each iteration.**
