The line `a[j] = False` indicates that the element at index `j` in the list or array `a` is being set to `False`. The value of `j` is previously defined as `i`. The initial state indicates that `i` is a positive integer between 1 and `n`, and thus `j` will also be within the same range. 

Since the specific values of `i`, `n`, and the contents of `a` are not given, we only know that `a[j]` is being set to `False` where `j = i`. The state of other variables is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`; `j` is `i`; and `a[j]` is set to False.**
