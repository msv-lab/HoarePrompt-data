Output State: **The loop sets specific indices of the list `a` to False, starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and incrementing by `i`. After executing the loop, `a[j]` will be False for each computed value of `j`. If `i` is such that `i ** 2 - 1` is greater than or equal to 1,000,000, the loop will not execute, and the list `a` will remain unchanged with all values set to True. The loop will also not execute if `i` is less than 1 or greater than `n`, but given the initial state, `i` is guaranteed to be within the valid range.**
