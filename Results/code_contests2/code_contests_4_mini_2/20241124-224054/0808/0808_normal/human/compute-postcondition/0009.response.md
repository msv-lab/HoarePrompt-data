To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the loop header `for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):`. 

1. **Understanding the Range**:
   - The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` until it reaches or exceeds 1,000,000.
   - The current value of `i` is 2, so we compute `i ** 2 - 1`:
     - \( i ** 2 - 1 = 2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \).
   - The loop will iterate starting from 3 and incrementing by 2 (since `i` is 2).

2. **Current State of `j`**:
   - Given that `j` is currently 7 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to find the next value of `j` for the loop to execute again.

3. **Next Value of `j`**:
   - The next value of `j` will be calculated as `j + i`, which is \( 7 + 2 = 9 \).

4. **Determining the Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Since 9 is less than 1,000,000, this condition is satisfied.

5. **Final State Adjustments**:
   - `j` needs to be updated to 9 for the next iteration.
   - No other variables need adjustment since the conditions on `n` and the array `a` do not affect the loop's execution.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a[1]` is True; `a[3]` is False; `a[5]` is False; `a[7]` is now False; `i` is 2; `j` is 9**
