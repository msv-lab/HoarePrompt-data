Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where indices corresponding to multiples of prime numbers starting from 2 are set to False. If `a[i - 1]` is True for each prime `i`, all elements of `a` from index `i^2 - 1` up to 999,999 that are multiples of `i` are set to False. If `i^2 - 1` is greater than or equal to 1,000,000, the loop does not modify `a`, leaving all elements as True. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `a` remains unchanged with all elements set to True. Additionally, if `a` has been modified in previous iterations, its state will reflect those changes.**
