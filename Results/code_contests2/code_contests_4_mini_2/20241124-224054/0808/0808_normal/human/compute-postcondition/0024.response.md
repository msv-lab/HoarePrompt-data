The value at index `j` of the list `a` is being set to `False`. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list with 1,000,000 elements, and since `j` is 15, the value of `a[15]` will change to `False`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a[15]` is False, `i` is 4, `j` is 15.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a[15]` is False, `i` is 4, `j` is 15**
