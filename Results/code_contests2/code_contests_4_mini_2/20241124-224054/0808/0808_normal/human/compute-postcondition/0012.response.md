According to the code, the loop continues as long as `i` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which is still less than 1,000,000. Therefore, the loop will execute again with `i` incremented by 1. 

No other states need to be adjusted as `n` remains unchanged, and since `a[1]` is True, the multiples of `i` starting from `i^2 - 1` will be addressed in the next iteration when `i` becomes 3. 

Hence, the adjusted state for the next iteration should reflect the incremented value of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements initially set to True, `i` is 3**
