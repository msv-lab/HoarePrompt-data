Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements. If `a[2]` (which is `a[i - 1]` when `i` is 3) is True, then all elements of `a` from index `i^2 - 1` (which is 8) to the largest index processed without exceeding 1,000,000 are set to False. If `i^2 - 1` is greater than or equal to 1,000,000, then `a` remains unchanged with all elements set to True. Thus, if `a[2]` is True and `i^2 - 1` is valid, `j` represents the last processed index which is less than 1,000,000.***
