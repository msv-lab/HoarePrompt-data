The code assigns `False` to `a[j]`, where `j` is 14. Since `a[11]` is already set to `False`, the assignment does not change the state of `a[11]`, but it does affect `a[14]`. The value of `n`, `i`, and `a[8]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[8]` is False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14; `a[11]` is False; `a[14]` is set to False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[8]` is False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14; `a[11]` is False; `a[14]` is set to False.**
