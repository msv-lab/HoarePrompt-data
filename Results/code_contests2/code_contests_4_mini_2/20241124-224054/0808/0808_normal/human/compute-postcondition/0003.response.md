To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop statement and the provided state. 

The loop is defined as:
```
for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
```

1. **Understanding the range parameters**:
   - The starting point of the range is `i ** 2 - 1`. 
   - The ending point is `1000000`, and the step is `i`.

2. **Calculating the starting point**:
   - Given `i` is 2, we calculate the starting point:
     - `i ** 2 - 1` = `2 ** 2 - 1` = `4 - 1` = `3`.
   - Therefore, the loop will start at `j = 3`.

3. **Determining if the loop will execute**:
   - The loop will execute if the starting point (3) is less than the ending point (1000000). 
   - Since 3 is indeed less than 1000000, the loop can execute.

4. **Understanding the variables**:
   - Before the loop starts, `i` is 2, and thus we will be incrementing `j` by 2 in each iteration.
   - The variable `j` will start from 3 and will take values like 3, 5, 7, ..., up to a maximum of less than 1000000.

5. **Final state adjustments**:
   - The current values of `n`, `a`, and `i` do not require adjustments for the loop to execute. The only relevant state for the loop execution is that `j` should start at 3.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements all set to True, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and a[1] is True**
