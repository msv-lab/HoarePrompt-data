According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop is structured to iterate starting from `i ** 2 - 1` up to (but not including) 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` each time. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 3, so `i ** 2 - 1` is \(3^2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8\).
- The loop starts at 8 and increments by 3 each iteration.

The last value of `j` before the next iteration would be 14 (as given in the state), which means the next value of `j` would be \(14 + 3 = 17\). 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than 1,000,000. Since `j` is currently 14, the condition for the loop to execute again is satisfied. Therefore, `j` should be updated to 17, while the other state variables remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[8]` is False; `i` is 3; `j` is 17; `a[11]` is False; `a[14]` is set to False.**
