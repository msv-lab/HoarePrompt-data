The statement `a[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` of the list `a`. Here, `j` is 5, so `a[5]` will be set to `False`. The previous state of `a[5]` is not specified, but it will now definitely be `False`. Other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, and `a[1]`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a[1]` is True; `a[3]` is False; `a[5]` is now False; `i` is 2; `j` is 5.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a[1]` is True; `a[3]` is False; `a[5]` is now False; `i` is 2; `j` is 5**
