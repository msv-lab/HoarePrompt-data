To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the current state and the for loop's range.

1. The loop iterates with `j` starting at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` until it reaches 1,000,000 (not inclusive).
2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 11, and `i` is 3. 

First, we calculate the starting value for `j` in the next iteration:
- The starting value of `j` is `i ** 2 - 1 = 3 ** 2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8`.
  
Since `j` is currently 11, we need to ensure that it can be incremented from its last value (11) in the next iteration. The next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is 11 + 3 = 14.

Next, we need to check if this next value (14) is still less than 1,000,000:
- Since 14 is indeed less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is currently 11, and the next value of `j` will be 14.
- `i` remains 3.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` to 14 for the next iteration. The values of `n`, `a[8]`, and `a[11]` do not need to be modified based on the loop's range.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[8]` is False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14; `a[11]` is set to False.**
