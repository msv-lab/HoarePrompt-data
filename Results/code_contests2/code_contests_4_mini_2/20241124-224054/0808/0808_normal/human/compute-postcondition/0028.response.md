The code assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` of the array `a`. Since `j` is 23, the value at `a[23]` is set to `False`. However, the initial state does not mention that `a` has been initialized with a size to accommodate index 23. Assuming `a` is defined to have at least 24 elements (from index 0 to 23), the previous value of `a[23]` is not specified, so we only know that it is now `False`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[15]` is False; `i` is 4; `j` is 23; and `a[23]` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[15]` is False; `i` is 4; `j` is 23; and `a[23]` is False**.
