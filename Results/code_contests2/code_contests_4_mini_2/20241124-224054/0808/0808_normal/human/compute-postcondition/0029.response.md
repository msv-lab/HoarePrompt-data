According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the range defined by `j`. The loop iterates starting from `i ** 2 - 1` up to 1,000,000 with a step of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 4, so `i ** 2 - 1` equals `16 - 1` which is `15`.
- The loop starts at `j = 15` and increments by `i` (which is 4) each time.

In the first iteration of the loop:
- The range starts at `15` and continues to `1,000,000`. Since `j` is currently `23`, the loop has executed at least once with `j` being `15`, `19`, and `23`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by `i` (4). The next value for `j` would be `23 + 4 = 27`.

Now we check if `j` (27) is less than 1,000,000. Since it is, the loop can execute again.

Thus, the updated states are:
- `j` should be adjusted to 27.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[15]` is False; `i` is 4; `j` is 27; and `a[23]` is False**
