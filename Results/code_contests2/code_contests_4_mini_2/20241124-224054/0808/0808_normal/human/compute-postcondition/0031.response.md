Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, and `i` is 4. If `a[3]` (which corresponds to `a[i - 1]`) is True, all elements of `a` at indices starting from `15` (i.e., `i ** 2 - 1`) and incremented by `4` are set to False, resulting in `a[15]`, `a[19]`, `a[23]`, ..., `a[999,999]` being False. If `a[3]` is False, no changes are made to the list `a`. The loop will not execute if `i` is not equal to `4`, since in this case the condition would not trigger any changes.***
