The code assigns the value `False` to `a[j]`, where `j` is 7. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `a[7]`, we assume it was previously unspecified. Thus, after execution, `a[7]` will be `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a[1]` is True; `a[3]` is False; `a[5]` is False; `a[7]` is now False; `i` is 2; `j` is 7.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a[1]` is True; `a[3]` is False; `a[5]` is False; `a[7]` is now False; `i` is 2; `j` is 7**
