According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. The loop starts with `j` equal to 5, and the increment for `j` in each iteration is determined by `i`, which is 2. The initial value of `j` for the next iteration is calculated as follows:

1. The starting value of `j` is `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`.
2. The loop continues while `j` is less than 1,000,000, incrementing `j` by `i` (which is 2) each time.

At the end of the last iteration, we have `j` equal to 5. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the value of `j` after the increment:

- The next value of `j` will be `5 + 2 = 7`.

Since `7` is still less than `1,000,000`, the loop can execute again.

No other variables need to be changed, as the only relevant state for the next iteration is the value of `j`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a[1]` is True; `a[3]` is False; `a[5]` is now False; `i` is 2; `j` is 7**
