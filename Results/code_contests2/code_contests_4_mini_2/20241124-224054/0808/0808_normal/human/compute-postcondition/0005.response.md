According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop runs for `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and continues while `j` is less than 1,000,000, incrementing `j` by `i` on each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2, so `i ** 2 - 1` equals `4 - 1 = 3`. 
- `j` is currently 3, which means it falls within the starting point of the loop (`3`) but the loop will not execute again because `j` needs to be at least `i ** 2 - 1` and must also be less than `1,000,000`. 

In the last iteration, `j` is 3, and since it’s less than `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 4), for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 5 (the next value based on the increment of `i`, which is 2). 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted so that `j` starts from 5. Since `j` is incremented by `i`, it will be 5 in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[3]` is now False, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `a[1]` is True**
