Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements initially set to True. If `a[1]` is True (which it is when `i` is 2), then all indices of `a` that correspond to multiples of `i` starting from `i^2 - 1` up to but not including 1,000,000 are set to False. If `i^2 - 1` is greater than or equal to 1,000,000, then `a` remains unchanged, all True. In all cases, `n` and `i` retain their defined values.***
