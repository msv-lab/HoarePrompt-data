According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and the upper limit of the range, which is 1,000,000. The loop starts from `i ** 2 - 1` and increments `j` by `i` until it reaches 1,000,000.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, `i ** 2 - 1` calculates to `3 ** 2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8`. Given that `j` is currently 8, the next value of `j` will be `8 + 3 = 11` in the next iteration.

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if `j` is less than 1,000,000 after this update:

- The next value of `j` will be 11, which is less than 1,000,000.

Since there are no other states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we conclude that `j` will be updated to 11.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[8]` set to False; `i` is 3; `j` is 11**
