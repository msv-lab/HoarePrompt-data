The `print(ans)` statement outputs the value of `ans`, which is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum string values in the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `N` is a positive integer, and `a` contains strings. However, since the specific contents of `a` are not provided, we cannot derive the exact value of `ans`. 

The output state remains focused on the provided variables. Therefore, the output state indicates that `N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of strings, and `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum string values in `a`, which is now being printed.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of strings; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum string values in `a`, and the value of `ans` is printed.**
