The variable `a` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which means it will take input as a string, split it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and store that list in `a`. The initial state indicates that `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100), and `a` is a list intended to hold `N` integers. The content of `a` will now be a list of strings, representing the integers inputted. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a` is now a list of strings based on the input received.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of strings from input**
