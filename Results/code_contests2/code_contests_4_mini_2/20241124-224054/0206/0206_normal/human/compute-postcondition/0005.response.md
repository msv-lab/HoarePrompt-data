The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it reads input directly from the user. It first reads a value that is expected to be a positive integer \( N \) (although the code does not enforce this). Then, it reads a second line of input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of \( N \) integers. The function calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of this list and prints the result.

However, the function lacks error handling for several potential edge cases: 
1. It does not validate that \( N \) is a positive integer or that the list contains exactly \( N \) integers.
2. It does not check the validity of the integers in terms of range (0 to 1000) as specified in the annotations.
3. The input for \( N \) and the subsequent list of integers are captured as strings, necessitating conversion to integers for accurate processing.

Functionality: ** The function reads an integer \( N \) and a list of \( N \) integers from user input, calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list, and prints the result. It does not validate the input or handle potential errors related to the input format. **
