To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and ensure it meets the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the minimum distance that AtCoDeer needs to travel to deliver gifts to all houses located at specified coordinates. The distance is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates for the houses.

### Program Analysis:
```python
N = raw_input()
a = raw_input().split()
ans = np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))
print(ans)
```

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input for `N` (the number of houses) and then reads the coordinates of the houses as a list of strings using `raw_input().split()`.
   
2. **Data Type**:
   - The code treats `a` as a list of strings. However, to work with numerical values, it should convert these strings to integers. The `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)` functions from NumPy will not work correctly on strings, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The distance is calculated as `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))`. If `a` contains strings, this will not yield correct numerical results. 

### Example of Incorrectness:
For example, if the input is:
```
4
2 3 7 9
```
The expected output is `7` because the maximum is `9` and the minimum is `2`, yielding a distance of `9 - 2 = 7`. However, since the code does not convert the input strings to integers, it will not compute the maximum and minimum correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the conversion of input strings to integers, leading to potential errors in computing the minimum distance.

Correctness: **False**.
