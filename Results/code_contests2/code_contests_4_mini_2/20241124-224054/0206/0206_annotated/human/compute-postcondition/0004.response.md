The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `a`. The parameter `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. After executing the function body, the output is not specified in the provided constraints and relationships. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `N` and a list of integers `a`, without a clear return value specified. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N and a list of N integers a, where each integer satisfies the given constraints. The return value is not specified.**
