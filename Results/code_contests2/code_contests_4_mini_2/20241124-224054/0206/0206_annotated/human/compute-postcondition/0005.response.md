Functionality: ** The function accepts user input to read a positive integer N followed by a list of N integers. It computes the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list and prints this result. However, the function does not return any value, and there is no error handling for cases where N is zero or negative, or if the input values are not valid integers. **
