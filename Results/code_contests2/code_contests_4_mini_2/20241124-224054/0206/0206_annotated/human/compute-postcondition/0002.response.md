The code assigns the value of `ans` as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `a`. The list `a` contains `N` integers, where each integer satisfies the condition \(0 \leq a_i \leq 1000\). Therefore, `np.max(a)` retrieves the maximum value from the list, and `np.min(a)` retrieves the minimum value. The absolute difference is then calculated.

Since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and each \(a_i\) is between 0 and 1000, the output state will summarize the values of `N`, `a`, and `ans`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` integers satisfying 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of `a`.**
