To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze how it calculates the minimum perimeter for an area of N city blocks.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of city blocks.

2. **Calculating the Square Root**: 
   - It calculates `x`, which is the integer part of the square root of `n` (`x = int(n ** 0.5)`).
   - This value `x` represents the side length of the largest square that can fit within an area of `n`.

3. **Checking Perfect Square**: 
   - The first condition checks if `n` is a perfect square (`if x ** 2 == n`). If it is, the perimeter is simply `4 * x`.

4. **Handling Rectangles**:
   - If `n` is not a perfect square, it checks if `x * (x + 1) > n`. This checks if the area formed by `x` and `x + 1` (which represents a rectangle) is greater than `n`.
     - If true, it calculates the perimeter as `(x + x + 1) * 2`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the perimeter as `4 * (x + 1)`.

### Testing Cases:

Let's evaluate the program with some test cases, including edge cases and those not covered in the examples.

1. **Case N = 1**:
   - Expected output: Perimeter = 4 (since a single block forms a 1x1 square).
   - The program correctly calculates this as `4 * (1)` which gives `4`.

2. **Case N = 5**:
   - Expected output: The best shape is a 2x3 rectangle which gives a perimeter of 10.
   - The program calculates `x = 2`, checks `2 * (3) > 5` (false), and calculates `4 * (2 + 1) = 12`. 
   - This is incorrect; it should output 10.

3. **Case N = 6**:
   - Expected output: The best shape is a 2x3 rectangle, which gives a perimeter of 10.
   - Following similar logic, the program would again fail to provide the correct perimeter.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to correctly calculate the perimeter for certain values of `N` that are not perfect squares and where the area can be better formed by rectangles other than the one the program considers. This is evidenced by the examples we tested (specifically, N = 5 and N = 6).

Correctness: **False**
