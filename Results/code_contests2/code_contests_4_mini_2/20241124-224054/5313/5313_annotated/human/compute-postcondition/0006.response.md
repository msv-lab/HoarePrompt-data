The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Given that `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, we can express `answr` in terms of `x`. The calculation becomes `answr = (2x + 1) * 2`. 

Thus, `answr` is effectively `4x + 2`. Since `x` is defined as the integer part of the square root of `n`, which is a positive integer, `answr` will also be a positive integer.

The output state reflects the variables involved:
- `N` remains the same as a positive integer within the defined range.
- `n` remains the same as an input integer within the defined range.
- `x` remains the integer part of the square root of `n`.
- `answr` is now calculated as `4x + 2`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is `4x + 2`.**
