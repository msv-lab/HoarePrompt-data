The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Since `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, and `x` squared equals `n`, `n` can be expressed as `x^2`. Therefore, `answr` calculates to `x * 4`. The specific value of `answr` depends on the value of `x`, but it is guaranteed to be a multiple of 4 since `x` is an integer. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * x`.**
