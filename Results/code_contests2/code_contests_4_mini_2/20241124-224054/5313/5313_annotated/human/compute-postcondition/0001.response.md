The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, which is the integer part of the square root of `n`. Since `N` and `n` are both positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^6, the value of `x` will depend on the specific value of `n`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`**
