The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, the value of `n` will also fall within this range. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the definition of `N` and the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range**
