The `print(answr)` statement outputs the value of `answr`. The values of `N`, `n`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. However, since `answr` is an integer, it will be printed as is, but we don't have its specific value provided in the initial state description. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and indicates that `answr` is printed.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; and `answr` is printed.**
