The variable `answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`. The value of `x` is an integer such that `x * (x + 1) ≤ n`, but the specific value of `x` is not provided. Therefore, `answr` can take on multiple values depending on the value of `x`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is an integer such that `x * (x + 1) ≤ n; answr = 4 * (x + 1)**
