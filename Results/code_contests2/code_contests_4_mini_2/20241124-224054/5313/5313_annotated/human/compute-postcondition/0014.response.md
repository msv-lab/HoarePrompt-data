The function `func` does not accept any parameters and prompts the user to input an integer `n`. It calculates `x`, the integer part of the square root of `n`. The function checks whether `n` is a perfect square by comparing `x ** 2` with `n`. If it is a perfect square, the result `answr` is set to `x * 4`. If not, the function evaluates whether `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n` to determine the value of `answr`. If it is, `answr` is set to `(x + x + 1) * 2`, otherwise it is set to `4 * (x + 1)`. Finally, the function prints the value of `answr`. 

There are no explicit return statements; the function only prints the result, which can lead to confusion regarding its return behavior. Furthermore, the function assumes valid input from the user without handling potential exceptions or invalid input cases (e.g., non-integer inputs or negative numbers).

Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, reads an integer input `n`, and calculates a result based on whether `n` is a perfect square or falls into specific conditions related to its integer square root, then prints the result. It does not handle input errors or explicitly return a value. **
