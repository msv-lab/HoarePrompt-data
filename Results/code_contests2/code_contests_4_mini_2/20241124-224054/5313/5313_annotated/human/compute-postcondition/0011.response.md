The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `int(answr)`, which converts `answr` to an integer. The previous state of `answr` is unknown, but it is implied that it holds a value that can be converted to an integer. The other variables `N`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is now an integer.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is now an integer.**
