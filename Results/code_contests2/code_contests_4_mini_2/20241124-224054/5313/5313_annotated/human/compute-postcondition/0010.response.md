Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`. If `x ** 2 == n`, then `answr` is equal to `4 * x`. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, then `answr` is set to `4 * x + 2`. Otherwise, if `x * (x + 1) ≤ n`, then `answr` is set to `4 * (x + 1)`. This handles all scenarios for the values of `n` and `x` within the specified ranges, including edge cases where `n` is a perfect square or lies between the squares of two consecutive integers.***
