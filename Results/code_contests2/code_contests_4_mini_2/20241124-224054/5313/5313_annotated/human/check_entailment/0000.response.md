To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program logic against the requirements.

### Problem Requirements
The task is to find the shortest perimeter that can enclose an area of exactly N city blocks. The perimeter should be minimized while ensuring that the enclosed area is exactly N.

### Program Analysis
1. The first step in the function is to read an integer `n` which represents the area (number of blocks).
2. The variable `x` is calculated as the integer part of the square root of `n` (`x = int(n ** 0.5)`).
3. The program checks if `n` is a perfect square (`if (x ** 2 == n)`):
   - If true, the perimeter is `x * 4`.
4. If `n` is not a perfect square, the program checks if `x * (x + 1) > n`:
   - If true, it sets the perimeter as `(x + x + 1) * 2` (which simplifies to `4x + 2`).
   - If false, it sets the perimeter as `4 * (x + 1)`.

### Test Cases
Let's evaluate the given examples:

- **For `N = 4`**:
  - `x = 2` (since \( \sqrt{4} = 2 \))
  - Since `4` is a perfect square, perimeter = `2 * 4 = 8`. **Correct.**

- **For `N = 11`**:
  - `x = 3` (since \( \sqrt{11} \approx 3.316 \))
  - `3 * (3 + 1) = 12` which is greater than `11`, so perimeter = `(3 + 3 + 1) * 2 = 14`. **Correct.**

- **For `N = 22`**:
  - `x = 4` (since \( \sqrt{22} \approx 4.690 \))
  - `4 * (4 + 1) = 20`, which sets the perimeter to `20`. **Correct.**

### Edge Cases
Let's consider some additional edge cases:
- **For `N = 1`**:
  - `x = 1` (since \( \sqrt{1} = 1 \))
  - Since `1` is a perfect square, perimeter = `1 * 4 = 4`. **Correct.**
  
- **For `N = 2`**:
  - `x = 1` (since \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \))
  - `1 * (1 + 1) = 2`, which is not greater than `2`, hence perimeter = `4 * (1 + 1) = 8`. **Correct.**
  
- **For `N = 3`**:
  - `x = 1` (since \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \))
  - `1 * (1 + 1) = 2`, which is not greater than `3`, hence perimeter = `4 * (1 + 1) = 8`. **Correct.**

- **For `N = 12`**:
  - `x = 3` (since \( \sqrt{12} \approx 3.464 \))
  - `3 * (3 + 1) = 12`, which is not greater than `12`, hence perimeter = `4 * (3 + 1) = 16`. **Correct.**
  
- **For `N = 9`**:
  - `x = 3` (since \( \sqrt{9} = 3 \))
  - Since `9` is a perfect square, perimeter = `3 * 4 = 12`. **Correct.**

### Conclusion
After evaluating multiple test cases and edge cases, the program correctly calculates the minimum perimeter for any given integer N within the specified range.

Correctness: **True**
