Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a positive integer `n` from user input. It calculates the integer part of the square root of `n`, denoted as `x`, and based on various conditions regarding `n` and `x`, it computes a value `answr` which is then printed. Specifically, if `n` is a perfect square, it returns `4 * x`. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, it returns `2 * (2 * x + 1)`. Otherwise, it returns `4 * (x + 1)`. The function handles all cases for positive integers in the range 1 to 10^6.**
