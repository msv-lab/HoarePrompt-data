The variable `answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`. The initial state provides that `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, and the condition `x * (x + 1) ≤ n` holds true. Since `x` is defined based on `n`, we can calculate `answr` using the current value of `x`.

Given that `x` is determined from the input integer `n`, we can express `answr` as `4 * (x + 1)`. The exact value of `answr` will depend on the specific value of `x`, but we know that:

- `x` is a positive integer derived from `n` such that `x * (x + 1) ≤ n`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship and the calculated result for `answr`:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n` and the condition `x * (x + 1) ≤ n` holds true; `answr` is given by `4 * (x + 1)`**.
