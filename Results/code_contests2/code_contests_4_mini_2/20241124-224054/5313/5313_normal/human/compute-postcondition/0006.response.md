To determine the output state, we analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet. 

1. The initial state specifies that \( N \) is a positive integer between 1 and \( 10^6 \), and \( n \) is an input integer.
2. \( x \) is defined as the integer part of the square root of \( n \), which means \( x = \text{int}(\sqrt{n}) \).
3. Additionally, it is given that the product \( x \cdot (x + 1) \) is greater than \( n \).

The code snippet calculates:
```
answr = (x + x + 1) * 2
```
This simplifies to:
```
answr = (2x + 1) * 2 = 4x + 2
```

Given that \( x \) is derived from \( n \), and \( x \) satisfies the condition related to \( n \), we can conclude that:
- The value of \( answr \) is calculated based on the value of \( x \) as \( 4x + 2 \).

No other variables are affected, so the output state will reflect the values of \( N \), \( n \), \( x \), and \( answr \).

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, and `answr` is `4x + 2`.**
