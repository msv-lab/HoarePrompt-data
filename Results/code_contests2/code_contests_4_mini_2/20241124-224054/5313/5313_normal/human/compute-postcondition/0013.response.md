The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates based on the predefined value of `N`, which is a positive integer constrained to the range of 1 to 10^6. As such, the functionality of the function `func` is dependent on this internal value of `N`. Therefore, the function's output is determined by the logic that processes this value, which is expected to yield results based on the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on an internal positive integer N, constrained to the range 1 to 10^6.**
