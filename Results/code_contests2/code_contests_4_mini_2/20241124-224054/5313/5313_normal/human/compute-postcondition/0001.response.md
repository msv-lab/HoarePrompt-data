The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, which computes the square root of `n` and converts it to an integer. Since `n` is an input integer, the exact value of `x` depends on the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n**
