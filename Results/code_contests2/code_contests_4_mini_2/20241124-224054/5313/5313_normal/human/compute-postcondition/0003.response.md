The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Given that `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, and since `x` squared is equal to `n`, it follows that `n` is a perfect square. Therefore, `answr` will be equal to `4 * x`. However, since we do not have a specific value for `n` or `x`, we can only express `answr` in terms of `x`. The other variables' states are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * x`**
