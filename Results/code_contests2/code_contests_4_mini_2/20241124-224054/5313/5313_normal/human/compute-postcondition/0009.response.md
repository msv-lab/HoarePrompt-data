Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, then `answr` is calculated as `2 * (2x + 1)`. Otherwise, if `x * (x + 1) ≤ n`, then `answr` is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`. This covers all cases, including when `n` is a perfect square or when `x` is just below or just above the threshold dictated by `n`.***
