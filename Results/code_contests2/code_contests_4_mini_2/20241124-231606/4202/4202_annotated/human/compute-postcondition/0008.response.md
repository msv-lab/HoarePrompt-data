Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input provided through `raw_input()`. If the input string contains only '0's, then `pa` remains 0. If the input string is empty, the loop does not execute and `pa` remains 0. The value of `i` is the current character being processed from the input string, which can be either '0' or '1'.**
