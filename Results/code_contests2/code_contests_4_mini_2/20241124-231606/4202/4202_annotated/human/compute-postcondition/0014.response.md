According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `raw_input()`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in the input after the current character `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in the input, and `pb` either remains the same or is set to 1 depending on whether `i` is '1'. Since `i` is the current character, we need to consider that `raw_input()` must have at least one more character remaining for the loop to continue.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `raw_input()` has at least one more character. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to the next character in the input after the current one, and `pb` would depend on that next character.

State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input, `pb` is either 1 or remains the same depending on whether the next character after `i` is '1', `i` is the next character in the input after the current one**
