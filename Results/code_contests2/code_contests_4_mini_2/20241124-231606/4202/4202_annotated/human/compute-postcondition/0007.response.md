According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the `raw_input()` string. The loop continues as long as there are characters left to process in the input string. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is set to the index of the next character in the input string. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure that `i` is less than the length of the input string. If `i` is currently at the index of the last character or beyond, the loop cannot execute again. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to reflect that it is pointing to the next character, which would be one index higher than the current index. Additionally, we must ensure that `a` and `b` remain as strings of '0's and '1's, and `pa` remains unchanged or incremented as per the last operation. 

State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same, `i` is the next character index in the input string**
