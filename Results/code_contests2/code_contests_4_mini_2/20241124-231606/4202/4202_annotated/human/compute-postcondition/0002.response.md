The variable `pa` is incremented by 1 if the first character `i` of the input string is '1'. Since `pa` is initially 0, if `i` is '1', `pa` will become 1; if `i` is '0', `pa` will remain 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string of '0's and '1's, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first character of the input string which is either '0' or '1'.
Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is either 0 or 1, `i` is '0' or '1'**
