The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The initial state indicates that `pb` is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `i`. If `i` is '1', `pb` will be incremented from its current value; if `i` is not '1', `pb` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the possible values based on the condition.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input, `pb` is either 1 or remains the same depending on whether `i` is '1', `i` is the next character in the input**
