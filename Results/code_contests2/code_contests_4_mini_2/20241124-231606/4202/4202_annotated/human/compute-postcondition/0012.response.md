According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the input string provided by `raw_input()`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in the input string to iterate over. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of the input. Since `raw_input()` processes the input character by character, and `pb` indicates whether `i` is '1', the character `i` needs to be updated to the next character in the input. 

The count of '1's in the input, represented by `pa`, does not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue since it is based on the entire input string. However, `pb`, depending on the next character, may also change. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to the next character in the input.
- `pb` should be updated to reflect whether the new `i` is '1' or not.

Since we don't know the input's length or content, we can only say that `i` should point to the next character and `pb` will reflect the character's value.

State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input, `pb` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is the next character in the input, `i` is the next character in the input**
