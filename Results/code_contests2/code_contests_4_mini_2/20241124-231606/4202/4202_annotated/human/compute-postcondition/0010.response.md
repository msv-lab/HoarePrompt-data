According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided through `raw_input()`. The loop iterates over each character in the input. For the loop to execute, the input must contain at least one character. 

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `i` will represent each character in the input sequentially. If `pa` is the count of '1's in the input, it indicates that the input is non-empty since `pb` is initialized to 0, which does not influence the loop execution.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the conditions are:
- The `raw_input()` must have at least 1 character.
- The variable `i` should be initialized to the first character of the input.

State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input, `pb` is 0, `i` is the first character in the input**
