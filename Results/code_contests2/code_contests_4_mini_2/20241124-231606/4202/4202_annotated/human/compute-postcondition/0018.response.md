The value of `pb` is determined by the count of '1's in the input provided through `raw_input()`. Since the initial state specifies that `pb` is the count of '1's and `pa` remains the same as the initial count of '1's, we need to assess the relationship between `pa` and `pb`. 

The output of the print statement evaluates to 'YES' if `pa` is greater than or equal to `pb`, and 'NO' otherwise. If the input is empty, `pb` remains 0, while `pa` retains its initial value.

Since the specific values of `pb` and `pa` are not provided, we can only describe their relationship based on the comparison.

Output State: **`pb` is the count of '1's in the input, `pa` remains the same as the initial count of '1's; print outputs 'YES' if `pa` >= `pb`, otherwise 'NO'.**
