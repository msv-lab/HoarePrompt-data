The code increments the value of `pa` by 1 if the character `i` is equal to '1'. The value of `pa` can either be 0 or 1, and `i` can be either '0' or '1'. Therefore, the new value of `pa` will be either 0 or 1 (if `i` is '0') or 1 or 2 (if `i` is '1'). The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, and `i`) are not affected. 

Thus, we can summarize the output state based on the possible values:

Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is either 0 or 1 or 1 or 2 depending on the value of `i`, `i` is the next character in the input string after the last processed character**
