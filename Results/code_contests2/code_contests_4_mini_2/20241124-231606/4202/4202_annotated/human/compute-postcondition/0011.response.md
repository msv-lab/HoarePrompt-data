The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is equal to '1'. The initial state indicates that `pa` is the count of '1's in the input, `pb` is 0, and `i` is the first character in the input. Therefore, if `i` is '1', then `pb` will become 1, otherwise, it will remain 0. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `pb` based on the comparison.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input, `pb` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is '1', `i` is the first character in the input**
