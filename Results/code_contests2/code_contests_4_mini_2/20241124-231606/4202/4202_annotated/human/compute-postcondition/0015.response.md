The statement `pb += i == '1'` increments `pb` by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The value of `pb` can either be 1 or remain the same, depending on the condition. Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `i`.

If `i` is '1', then `pb` increases by 1. If `i` is not '1', then `pb` remains unchanged.

Given that `pb` is either 1 or remains the same, the possible scenarios are:
- If `i` is '1', then `pb` becomes 2 (if it was initially 1).
- If `i` is not '1', then `pb` stays the same.

Since the value of `pb` could either be 1 or whatever its previous value was, we can summarize the output state accordingly.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input; `pb` is either 2 (if `i` is '1') or remains the same (if `i` is not '1'); `i` is the next character in the input after the current one.**
