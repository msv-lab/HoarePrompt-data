You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are fishing with polar bears Alice and Bob. While waiting for the fish to bite, the polar bears get bored. They come up with a game. First Alice and Bob each writes a 01-string (strings that only contain character "0" and "1") a and b. Then you try to turn a into b using two types of operations:

  * Write parity(a) to the end of a. For example, <image>. 
  * Remove the first character of a. For example, <image>. You cannot perform this operation if a is empty. 



You can use as many operations as you want. The problem is, is it possible to turn a into b?

The parity of a 01-string is 1 if there is an odd number of "1"s in the string, and 0 otherwise.

Input

The first line contains the string a and the second line contains the string b (1 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ 1000). Both strings contain only the characters "0" and "1". Here |x| denotes the length of the string x.

Output

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible to turn a into b, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

01011
0110


Output

YES


Input

0011
1110


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample, the steps are as follows: 01011 → 1011 → 011 → 0110
Program:
```

def func():
    pa = 0
    for i in raw_input():
        pa += i == '1'
    pb = 0
    for i in raw_input():
        pb += i == '1'
    print['NO', 'YES'][pa >= pb]
```
