The function accepts no parameters and counts the number of '1's in two separate input strings (one after another) provided through `raw_input()`. It then compares the counts and prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first input is greater than or equal to that in the second input; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If either input is empty, the respective count of '1's will be 0, which could lead to a 'YES' if the first input has at least one '1'. The function does not handle cases where the input contains characters other than '0' and '1', as they do not affect the count.
