You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are fishing with polar bears Alice and Bob. While waiting for the fish to bite, the polar bears get bored. They come up with a game. First Alice and Bob each writes a 01-string (strings that only contain character "0" and "1") a and b. Then you try to turn a into b using two types of operations:

  * Write parity(a) to the end of a. For example, <image>. 
  * Remove the first character of a. For example, <image>. You cannot perform this operation if a is empty. 



You can use as many operations as you want. The problem is, is it possible to turn a into b?

The parity of a 01-string is 1 if there is an odd number of "1"s in the string, and 0 otherwise.

Input

The first line contains the string a and the second line contains the string b (1 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ 1000). Both strings contain only the characters "0" and "1". Here |x| denotes the length of the string x.

Output

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible to turn a into b, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

01011
0110


Output

YES


Input

0011
1110


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample, the steps are as follows: 01011 → 1011 → 011 → 0110
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    pa = 0
    for i in raw_input():
        pa += i == '1'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `pa` is the count of '1's in the input provided through `raw_input()`. If the input string contains only '0's, then `pa` remains 0. If the input string is empty, the loop does not execute and `pa` remains 0. The value of `i` is the current character being processed from the input string, which can be either '0' or '1'.
    pb = 0
    for i in raw_input():
        pb += i == '1'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `pb` is the count of '1's in the input provided through `raw_input()`, `pa` remains the same as the initial count of '1's. If the input is empty, the loop does not execute and `pb` remains 0. If the input contains characters other than '1', those do not affect `pb`.
    print['NO', 'YES'][pa >= pb]

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
