The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. Since `pa` can either be 0 or 1, and `i` can either be '0' or '1', the possible new values for `pa` after the operation are as follows:
- If `i` is '1', `pa` will be incremented by 1, resulting in a new value of either 1 or 2.
- If `i` is '0', `pa` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the potential new states of `pa` based on the value of `i`. Since `b` and `a` are not affected, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with at least one more character, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is either 1 or 2 depending on if `i` is '1' or remains the same if `i` is '0', `i` is either '0' or '1'**
