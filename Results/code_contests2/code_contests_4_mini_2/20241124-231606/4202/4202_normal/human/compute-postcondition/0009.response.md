The variable `pb` is assigned the value 0, which does not depend on any previous values since it is initialized directly. The initial state of `pa` remains unchanged and `a` and `b` are unaffected as well. Therefore, the output state is: `pa` is the count of '1's from the input, `a` is a string of '0' and '1', `b` is a string of '0' and '1', and `pb` is 0.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's from the input, `a` is a string of '0' and '1', `b` is a string of '0' and '1', and `pb` is 0**
