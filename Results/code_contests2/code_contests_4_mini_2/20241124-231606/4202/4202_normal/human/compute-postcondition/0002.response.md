The variable `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The value of `pa` is currently 0, and the value of `i` is the first character from `raw_input()`, which is a string of length greater than 0. If `i` is '1', then `pa` will become 1; if `i` is '0', then `pa` will remain 0. Therefore, the output state reflects both possibilities for `pa` based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a string of '0' and '1', `b` is a string of '0' and '1', `pa` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is '0' or '1', `i` is the first character from raw_input()**
