According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more characters in the input string provided by `raw_input()`. The variable `i` represents the current character from the input string, and it needs to be updated for the loop to iterate again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third character of the input string. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the fourth character of the input string, and the length of the input string must be at least 4 characters.

The variable `pa` does not need to be adjusted since it is based on the count of '1's from the input, and `b` is not affected by the loop iteration directly.

Thus, the states to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be the fourth character of the input string.
- The length of the input string must be at least 4 characters.

State: **`pa` is the count of '1's from the input, `a` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1' with at least 4 characters, `b` is a string of '0' and '1', `pb` is updated based on the next character of `i`, `i` is the fourth character of the input string**
