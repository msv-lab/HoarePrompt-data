The `print` statement evaluates the expression `['NO', 'YES'][pa >= pb]`. The comparison `pa >= pb` checks if the initial count of '1's (`pa`) is greater than or equal to the count of '1's in the input string (`pb`). If the input string is empty, `pb` remains 0, while `pa` retains its initial count. Hence, the output will either be 'YES' if `pa` is greater than or equal to `pb` or 'NO' if it is not. 

Since `pb` is the count of '1's in the input string read from `raw_input()`, and if the input is empty, `pb` is 0. Therefore, the output depends on the value of `pa`. 

Assuming that `pa` is greater than or equal to `pb`, the output will be 'YES'. If `pa` is less than `pb`, the output will be 'NO'.

Output State: **`pb` is 0, `pa` is the initial count of '1's in the input, and the output is 'YES' if `pa >= pb`, otherwise 'NO'**
