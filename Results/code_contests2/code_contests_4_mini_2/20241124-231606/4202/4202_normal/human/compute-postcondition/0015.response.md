To analyze the impact of the code snippet:

1. The variable `pb` is updated based on the condition `i == '1'`. 
2. If `i` (the third character of the input string `a`) is '1', `pb` is incremented by 1. If `i` is '0', `pb` remains unchanged.
3. The initial values of `pa`, `a`, and `pb` are not affected by this line of code, except for the potential change in the value of `pb`.

Assuming `pb` had a previous value before this line was executed (which isn't specified), we can summarize the output state accordingly:

If `i` is '1', then `pb` becomes `pb + 1`.
If `i` is '0', then `pb` remains the same.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's from the input, `a` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1' with at least 3 characters, `b` is a string of '0' and '1', `pb` is updated based on the next character of `i`, `i` is the third character of the input string**
