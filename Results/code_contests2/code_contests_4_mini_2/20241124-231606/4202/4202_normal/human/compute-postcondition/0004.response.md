In the given code snippet, `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The initial state mentions that `i` is the second character from `raw_input()`, which means its value can be either '0' or '1'. 

If `i` is '1', `pa` will be incremented by 1. If `i` is '0', `pa` will remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation, and `pa` may either increase by 1 or stay the same.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the possible new values of `pa` based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a string of '0' and '1', `b` is a string of '0' and '1', `pa` is either 0 or 1 or 1 or 2 depending on `i`, `i` is either '0' or '1'**
