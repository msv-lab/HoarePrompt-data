Functionality: ** The function accepts two binary strings as input, counts the occurrences of '1's in each string, and prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to the count in the second string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the inputs contain characters other than '0' or '1', and if the inputs are empty, it will return 'NO' since both counts will be zero. **
