The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `m`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of flowers (with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and `m` is a positive integer representing the number of visitors (with the constraint 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000). Each visitor is defined by a pair of integers (l_i, r_i) such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. Based on the provided output details, the function processes the input related to the visitors and their interactions with the flowers. However, the specific output based on the visitors' pairs is not detailed in the original input. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two integers, `n` and `m`, which represent the number of flowers and the number of visitors respectively. The exact return value or behavior based on the visitors' pairs is not defined in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n (number of flowers) and m (number of visitors), both being positive integers, and processes the interactions of visitors with a range of flowers defined by their pairs.**
