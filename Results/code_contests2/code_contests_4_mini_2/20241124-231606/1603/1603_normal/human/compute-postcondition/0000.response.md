The code assigns values to `n` and `m` by reading from input and converting the input values into integers. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not specified, but they represent the number of flowers and visitors, respectively, both being positive integers. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` and `m` are now assigned values from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of flowers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of visitors**
