The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of flowers and `m` represents the number of visitors. However, the function does not utilize the value of `m`. It constructs and prints a string consisting of '10' repeated (n // 2) times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd. The function does not return any value and does not handle any edge cases related to the input values.
