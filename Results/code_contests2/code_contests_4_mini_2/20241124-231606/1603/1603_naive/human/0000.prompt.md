You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sonya decided to organize an exhibition of flowers. Since the girl likes only roses and lilies, she decided that only these two kinds of flowers should be in this exhibition.

There are n flowers in a row in the exhibition. Sonya can put either a rose or a lily in the i-th position. Thus each of n positions should contain exactly one flower: a rose or a lily.

She knows that exactly m people will visit this exhibition. The i-th visitor will visit all flowers from l_i to r_i inclusive. The girl knows that each segment has its own beauty that is equal to the product of the number of roses and the number of lilies.

Sonya wants her exhibition to be liked by a lot of people. That is why she wants to put the flowers in such way that the sum of beauties of all segments would be maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1≤ n, m≤ 10^3) — the number of flowers and visitors respectively.

Each of the next m lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (1≤ l_i≤ r_i≤ n), meaning that i-th visitor will visit all flowers from l_i to r_i inclusive.

Output

Print the string of n characters. The i-th symbol should be «0» if you want to put a rose in the i-th position, otherwise «1» if you want to put a lily.

If there are multiple answers, print any.

Examples

Input

5 3
1 3
2 4
2 5


Output

01100

Input

6 3
5 6
1 4
4 6


Output

110010

Note

In the first example, Sonya can put roses in the first, fourth, and fifth positions, and lilies in the second and third positions;

  * in the segment [1…3], there are one rose and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to 1⋅ 2=2; 
  * in the segment [2…4], there are one rose and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to 1⋅ 2=2; 
  * in the segment [2…5], there are two roses and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to 2⋅ 2=4. 



The total beauty is equal to 2+2+4=8.

In the second example, Sonya can put roses in the third, fourth, and sixth positions, and lilies in the first, second, and fifth positions;

  * in the segment [5…6], there are one rose and one lily, so the beauty is equal to 1⋅ 1=1; 
  * in the segment [1…4], there are two roses and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to 2⋅ 2=4; 
  * in the segment [4…6], there are two roses and one lily, so the beauty is equal to 2⋅ 1=2. 



The total beauty is equal to 1+4+2=7.
Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print('10' * (n // 2) + ('1' if n & 1 else ''))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
