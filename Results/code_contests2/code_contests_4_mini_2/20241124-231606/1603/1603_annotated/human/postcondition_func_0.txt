The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from input, but it does not use `m` or any pairs of integers (l_i, r_i). It constructs and prints a string consisting of '10' repeated `n // 2` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd, effectively outputting a string of '10's and potentially one '1' based on the value of `n`. It does not return any values.
