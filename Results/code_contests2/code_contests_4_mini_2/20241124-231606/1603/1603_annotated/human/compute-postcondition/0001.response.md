The `print` statement concatenates strings based on the value of `n`. The expression `'10' * (n // 2)` creates a string that consists of the substring '10' repeated `n // 2` times, and `('1' if n & 1 else '')` appends '1' if `n` is odd (i.e., `n & 1` evaluates to true) or an empty string if `n` is even. The values of `m` are not affected by this statement. 

Since `n` is an input integer, we denote it as `n` and `m` remains as an input integer. The output will depend on the specific value of `n`, but we can express the output based on the evenness or oddness of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and the output is the string '10' repeated (n // 2) times followed by '1' if n is odd or an empty string if n is even.**
