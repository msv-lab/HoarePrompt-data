The values of `n` and `m` are assigned from the input provided by `raw_input().split()`, which is then processed by `map(int, ...)` to convert them to integers. Since `n` and `m` are already defined as integers within the specified range, their values are updated based on the input. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is simply the new values of `n` and `m` after the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**
