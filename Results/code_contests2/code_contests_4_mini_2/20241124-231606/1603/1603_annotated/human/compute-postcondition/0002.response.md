The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as input. Instead, it relies on external input data that consists of `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. Additionally, the input includes `m` pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) with constraints 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The function processes this input and produces a result based on the specified conditions. However, the exact output of the function is not provided in the context.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but processes external inputs consisting of integers n and m, along with m pairs of integers (l_i, r_i), returning results based on these inputs.**
