Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input. It computes and prints \(2^{\text{len(bin}(n)[2:])} - 1\) if \(k > 1\), otherwise, it prints `n`. This means if \(k\) is 1, it simply returns `n`, and for \(k > 1\) it calculates a value based on the binary representation of `n`. The function does not handle or check for invalid input values, so it assumes that `n` and `k` are valid positive integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).**
