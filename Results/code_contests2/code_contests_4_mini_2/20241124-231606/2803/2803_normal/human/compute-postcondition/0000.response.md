The code assigns values to `n` and `k` by taking input from the user and mapping it to integers. The previous values of `n` and `k` are unknown, but they are within the constraints of 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. After execution, `n` and `k` will hold the values provided by the user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `k` are now assigned positive integer values from user input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers assigned from user input, satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
