The function `func` does not accept any parameters as it is defined without any inputs. Given the constraints that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), we can infer that these values must be provided or initialized within the function. 

However, the output behavior is not specified in detail. Therefore, without specific cases or conditions outlined for `n` and `k`, we cannot categorize different return points.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified; it likely operates on internally defined positive integers `n` and `k` with constraints \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).**
