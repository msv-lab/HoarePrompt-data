You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Since Grisha behaved well last year, at New Year's Eve he was visited by Ded Moroz who brought an enormous bag of gifts with him! The bag contains n sweet candies from the good ol' bakery, each labeled from 1 to n corresponding to its tastiness. No two candies have the same tastiness.

The choice of candies has a direct effect on Grisha's happiness. One can assume that he should take the tastiest ones — but no, the holiday magic turns things upside down. It is the xor-sum of tastinesses that matters, not the ordinary sum!

A xor-sum of a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., am is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements: <image>, here <image> denotes the bitwise XOR operation; more about bitwise XOR can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR)

Ded Moroz warned Grisha he has more houses to visit, so Grisha can take no more than k candies from the bag. Help Grisha determine the largest xor-sum (largest xor-sum means maximum happiness!) he can obtain.

Input

The sole string contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1018).

Output

Output one number — the largest possible xor-sum.

Examples

Input

4 3


Output

7


Input

6 6


Output

7

Note

In the first sample case, one optimal answer is 1, 2 and 4, giving the xor-sum of 7.

In the second sample case, one can, for example, take all six candies and obtain the xor-sum of 7.
Program:
```

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print(2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1 if k - 1 else n)
```
