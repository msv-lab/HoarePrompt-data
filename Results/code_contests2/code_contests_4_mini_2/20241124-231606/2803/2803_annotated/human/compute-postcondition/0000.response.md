The variables `n` and `k` are both positive integers, and the code snippet reads input values for `n` and `k` using `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input, and `map(int, ...)`, which converts these string inputs to integers. The values of `n` and `k` will be directly assigned based on the user input, but since the specific input is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers assigned from user input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
