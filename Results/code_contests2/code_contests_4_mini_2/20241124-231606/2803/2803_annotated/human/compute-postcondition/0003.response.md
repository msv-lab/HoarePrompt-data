Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` as input from the user. If `k` is greater than 1, it calculates and returns \(2^{\text{len(bin(n)[2:])}} - 1\), which represents the maximum number of non-empty subsets of the binary representation of `n`. If `k` is equal to 1, it simply returns `n`. The function does not handle cases where the input does not meet the constraint \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). **
