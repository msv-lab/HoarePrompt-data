Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a string input representing two integers, `A` and `B`. It initializes a counter `ans` to count how many integers in the inclusive range from `A` to `B-1` have a specific property: the first character must equal the fifth character, and the second character must equal the fourth character of their string representation. If `A` equals `B`, it sets `ans` to 1. The function then prints the value of `ans`. The code does not handle invalid input cases, such as non-integer values or inputs that do not contain two elements. **
