To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. The loop iterates over a range defined by the integers `A` and `B`. Specifically, it runs from `int(A)` to `int(B)`.
2. The end condition for the loop is when `i` reaches `int(B)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(B)`.
3. Since `A` is a string representing an integer less than `B`, and `i` is initialized to `int(A)`, the loop will start at `int(A)`.
4. If `i` is currently at `int(B) - 1` (the last valid value before reaching `int(B)`), the loop can execute one more time.
5. The loop will iterate up to `int(B) - 1`, meaning it will increment `i` by 1 on each iteration until it equals `int(B)`.

Since the state of `i` is not explicitly provided, we can infer that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` should be `int(B) - 1` in order to allow the loop to run one more time:

- The value of `i` needs to be adjusted to be equal to `int(B) - 1` so that it will be less than `int(B)`.
- The values of `A`, `B`, and any other variables do not need to change for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` is a string representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of substrings obtained from splitting `a`; `A` is a string representing an integer less than that of `B`; `B` is a string representing an integer greater than that of `A`; `ans` is either 0 or 1; `i` is int(B) - 1**
