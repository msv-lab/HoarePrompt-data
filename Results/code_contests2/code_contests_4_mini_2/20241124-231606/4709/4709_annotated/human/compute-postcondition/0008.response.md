According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `A` and `B`. The loop will execute if `int(A)` is less than `int(B)`. If `int(A)` is equal to `int(B)`, the loop will not execute at all. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states so that `int(A)` is less than `int(B)`. Additionally, we need to set the initial value of `i` to `int(A)` since that is the starting point of the loop. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
1. `A` should be set to a string that represents a number smaller than that of `B`.
2. `B` should be set to a string that represents a number larger than that of `A`.
3. `i` should be initialized to `int(A)`.

State: **`a` is a string representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of substrings obtained from splitting `a`; `A` is a string representing an integer less than that of `B`; `B` is a string representing an integer greater than that of `A`; `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on the values of `A` and `B`; `i` is `int(A)`**
