Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of substrings obtained from splitting `a`; `A` is a string representing an integer less than that of `B`; `B` is a string representing an integer greater than that of `A`; `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2. If the characters at positions C[0] and C[4] are equal and the characters at positions C[1] and C[3] are equal, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The value of `C` is derived from the string representation of `i`, which is `int(B) - 1`.***
