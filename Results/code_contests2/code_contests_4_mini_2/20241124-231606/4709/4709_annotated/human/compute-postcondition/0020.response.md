Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of substrings obtained from splitting `a`; `A` is a string representing an integer less than `B - 1`; `B` is a string representing an integer greater than `A`; `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2; `i` is `int(A) + 1`; `C` is the list of characters from the string representation of `i`. If the first character of `C` is equal to the fifth character and the second character is equal to the fourth character, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. This means that `ans` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the initial value of `ans` and whether the specified conditions on `C` are met.***
