Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of substrings obtained from splitting `a`; `A` is a string representing an integer less than that of `B`; `B` is a string representing an integer greater than that of `A`; `ans` is either 0 or 1, and it is increased by 1 if the first character of `C` (which is derived from `i`, the integer value of `A`) is equal to the fifth character of `C`, and the second character of `C` is equal to the fourth character of `C`. If these conditions are not met, `ans` remains unchanged.***
