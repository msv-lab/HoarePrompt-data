Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not address the problem description correctly. The problem requires a function to extract and print the diagonal characters from a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, specifically the characters at positions (0,0), (1,1), and (2,2). 

However, the program attempts to read input as if it were dealing with numbers and performs unrelated operations (like comparing integers and checking conditions on digits). The logic does not correspond to extracting the required diagonal letters from a grid.

For example, given the input:
```
ant
obe
rec
```
The expected output should be `abc` (the diagonal letters), but the program does not produce this output at all. This demonstrates that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
