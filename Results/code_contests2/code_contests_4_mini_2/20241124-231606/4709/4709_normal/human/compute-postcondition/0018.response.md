The variable `i` is 123, and when `str(i)` is called, it converts `i` to the string "123". The `list()` function then converts this string into a list of its characters, resulting in `C` being assigned the value `['1', '2', '3']`. The other variables `a`, `l`, `A`, and `B` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is "123", `l` is a list containing the string "123", `A` is 123, `B` is greater than 124, `i` is 123, and `C` is ['1', '2', '3']**
