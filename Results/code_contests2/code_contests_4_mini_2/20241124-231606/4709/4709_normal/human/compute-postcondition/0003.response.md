The variable `B` is assigned the value of `l[1]`, which refers to the second element of the list `l`. Since `l` is a list containing the string `a`, the second element would be the second character of that string. Given that `a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l[1]` will yield the second letter of the string. The value of `A` remains unchanged and equal to `a`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing that string, `A` is equal to `a`, and `B` is the second character of that string.

Output State: **`a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing that string, `A` is equal to `a`, and `B` is the second character of that string**
