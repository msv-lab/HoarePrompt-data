The variable `l` is assigned the result of `a.split()`, which splits the string `a` into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Since `a` is a string of three lowercase English letters with no whitespace, `l` will be a list containing the original string `a` as its only element. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing that string.

Output State: **`a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing that string**
