`A` is assigned the value of `l[0]`, which is the first element of the list `l`. Since `l` contains the string `a`, `A` will be the same as `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is `a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing that string, and `A` is equal to `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing that string, and `A` is equal to `a`**
