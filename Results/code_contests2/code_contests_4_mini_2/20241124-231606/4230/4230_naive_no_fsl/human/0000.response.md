Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. 

The logic in the program is flawed because it iterates through the list of doors in reverse and checks for the first index where the door changes from one exit type (0 or 1) to the other. This approach does not accurately determine the minimum index `k` after which Mr. Black can exit the house. 

For example, consider the following case:

Input:
```
5
0 1 0 1 0
```

Expected output: `2` (After opening the first two doors, Mr. Black can exit since both exits have at least one door open.)

However, the program will output `1` because it finds the first change (from 0 to 1) at index `1`. This is incorrect because Mr. Black cannot exit the house until both exits have at least one open door.

Therefore, there are cases where the program does not work as expected, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
