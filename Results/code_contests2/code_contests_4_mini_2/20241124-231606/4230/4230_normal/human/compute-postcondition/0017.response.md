According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i`, which is initialized to `n - 4` at the end of the previous iteration. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is at least 3.
- `i` is `n - 4`, which means `i` can range from `-1` to `n - 4` (inclusive).

To execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `n - 5`. Therefore:
- `i` must be adjusted to `n - 5` for the loop to execute again.
- Since `n` is at least 3, `i` will be at least `-2` after this adjustment, which means the loop will not execute again.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to at least 4 (so that `i` becomes `-1`, allowing one more iteration), and `i` should be adjusted to `n - 5`.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 5`**
