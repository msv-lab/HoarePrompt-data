`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is `n - 3`, we can substitute that value in: `ans` becomes `(n - 3) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`. The state of `n` is at least 2, so `ans` will be at least 0. The output state is: `n` is at least 2, `ans` is at least 0, `i` is `n - 3`, and `ans` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `ans` is at least 0, `i` is `n - 3`, and `ans` is `n - 2`**
