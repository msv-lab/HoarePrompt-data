According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 2` is greater than or equal to `0`, which means `n` must be at least `2`. Before the loop starts, `ans` is `0` and `i` should be initialized to `n - 2` before the first iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least `2`, `i` is initialized to `n - 2`, and `c` is a map object containing integers but does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`**
