Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `ans` is 0, and `i` is `n - 3`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to `n - 2`, and the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]`, `ans` remains 0, and the program continues executing beyond this if statement without any updates to `ans`.***
