Output State: **If n is at least 2, then after the loop executes, `ans` will be the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]` (i.e., `ans` will be `i + 1`). If all elements are equal or if n is less than 2, the loop will not execute, and `ans` will remain 0. If n is exactly 2 and `c[0]` is equal to `c[1]`, `ans` is 0. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 0.**
