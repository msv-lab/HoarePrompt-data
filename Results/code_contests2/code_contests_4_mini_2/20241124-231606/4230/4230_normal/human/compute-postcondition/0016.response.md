Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `ans` is 0, and `i` is `n - 4`. If the elements at positions `i` and `i + 1` in array `c` are not equal, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the elements are equal, `ans` remains 0, and the loop or if statement continues without any changes to `ans`.***
