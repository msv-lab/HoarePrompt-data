Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `ans` is 0, and `i` is `n - 2`. If the character at index `i` in `c` is not equal to the character at index `i + 1`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` (which is `n - 1`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, `ans` remains 0, and no changes are made to `ans` or `i`.***
