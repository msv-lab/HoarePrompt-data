The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses. However, it operates under the constraints where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and `c` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. 

The function likely processes this input and returns a result based on the conditions defined by the values in `c`. 

Since the output is not specified in the provided information, we cannot detail the return value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly. It operates under the constraints where n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and c is a list of integers (each integer is either 0 or 1). The exact return value is not specified.**
