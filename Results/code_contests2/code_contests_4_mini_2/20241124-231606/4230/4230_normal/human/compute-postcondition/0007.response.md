The code contains a `break` statement, which does not change the values of any variables but indicates that we are exiting the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables without any changes.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `ans` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
