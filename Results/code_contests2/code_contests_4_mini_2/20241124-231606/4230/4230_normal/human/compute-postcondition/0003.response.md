The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `c` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the first integer from the list obtained from `raw_input`, `c` is a map object containing integers from the input list, and `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list obtained from `raw_input`, `c` is a map object containing integers from the input list, and `ans` is 0**
