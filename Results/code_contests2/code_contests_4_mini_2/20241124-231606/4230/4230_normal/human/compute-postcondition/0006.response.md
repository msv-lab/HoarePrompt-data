The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, we can substitute that into the equation, resulting in `ans = (n - 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `ans = n - 1`. The values of `n` and `i` are affected, while `c[i]` and `c[i + 1]` are not relevant for this calculation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 2, `ans` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `ans` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 2**
