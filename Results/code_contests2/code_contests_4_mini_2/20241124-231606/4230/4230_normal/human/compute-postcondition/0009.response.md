According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, resulting in `i` being `n - 3`. 

Given that `n` is at least 2, `n - 3` will be at least -1, which is still valid for the loop condition. However, for the next loop iteration, we also need to ensure that `ans` is still 0 and that we are prepared to check the character at index `i` in `c`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to `n - 3` for the next iteration.
- `ans` should remain the same if we are considering the next loop execution without any updates.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 3`**
