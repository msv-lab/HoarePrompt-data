Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list `c` of integers from input. It finds the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]` by iterating from the second last index to the first. If all elements in `c` are equal or if `n` is less than 2, the function will return 0. The function does not accept parameters directly and prints the result instead of returning it.**
