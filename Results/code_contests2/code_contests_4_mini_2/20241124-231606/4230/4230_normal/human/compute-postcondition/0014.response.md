`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is `n - 4` and `n` is at least 3, the minimum value of `i` is -1 (when `n` is 3). Therefore, `ans` is at least 0 (because -1 + 1 = 0). The output state reflects the updated value of `ans` based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `ans` is at least 0, `i` is `n - 4`, and `ans` is `i + 1`**
