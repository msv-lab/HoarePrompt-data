To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code:

**Problem Description Recap:**
- There are two exits, left (0) and right (1).
- Doors can be opened in a sequence.
- Mr. Black can exit if all doors in at least one exit are open.
- We need to find the smallest index `k` such that after opening the first `k` doors, he can exit.

**Given Program:**
```python
n = map(int, raw_input().split())
n = n[0]
c = map(int, raw_input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if c[i] != c[i + 1]:
        ans = i + 1
        break
print(ans)
```

**Analysis of the Code:**
1. The code reads the number of doors `n` and the sequence `c` of size `n`.
2. It initializes `ans` to 0.
3. It then iterates from the second last door to the first door (from `n-2` to `0`).
4. If the current door and the next door are different (one is left and the other is right), it sets `ans` to `i + 1` and breaks out of the loop.
5. Finally, it prints `ans`.

**Issues Identified:**
- The program looks for the first point where the sequence changes from one exit to another, but this does not guarantee that all doors in either exit are open.
- The check for `c[i] != c[i + 1]` only determines a transition point between the exits and does not account for counting how many doors have been opened in either exit.
- If the doors are opened in a sequence where all doors from one exit are opened before the doors from the other exit, the program may not correctly identify when Mr. Black can exit.

**Counterexample for Failure:**
Consider the input:
```
4
0 0 0 1
```
In this case:
- The left exit doors (0) are opened first, and the right exit door (1) is opened last.
- Mr. Black can exit after opening the 4th door (all doors in the right exit are now open).
- The expected output should be `4`.

However, according to the current implementation:
- The loop will never iterate as `c[i] != c[i + 1]` will not be satisfied until the last door, and `ans` will remain `0`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly determine the smallest index `k` after which Mr. Black can exit, as demonstrated by the counterexample.
