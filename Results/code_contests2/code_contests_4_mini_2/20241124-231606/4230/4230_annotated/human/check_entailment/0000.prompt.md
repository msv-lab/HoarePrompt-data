You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Three years have passes and nothing changed. It is still raining in London, and Mr. Black has to close all the doors in his home in order to not be flooded. Once, however, Mr. Black became so nervous that he opened one door, then another, then one more and so on until he opened all the doors in his house.

There are exactly two exits from Mr. Black's house, let's name them left and right exits. There are several doors in each of the exits, so each door in Mr. Black's house is located either in the left or in the right exit. You know where each door is located. Initially all the doors are closed. Mr. Black can exit the house if and only if all doors in at least one of the exits is open. You are given a sequence in which Mr. Black opened the doors, please find the smallest index k such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first k doors.

We have to note that Mr. Black opened each door at most once, and in the end all doors became open.

Input

The first line contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of doors.

The next line contains n integers: the sequence in which Mr. Black opened the doors. The i-th of these integers is equal to 0 in case the i-th opened door is located in the left exit, and it is equal to 1 in case it is in the right exit.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one door located in the left exit and there is at least one door located in the right exit.

Output

Print the smallest integer k such that after Mr. Black opened the first k doors, he was able to exit the house.

Examples

Input


5
0 0 1 0 0


Output


3


Input


4
1 0 0 1


Output


3

Note

In the first example the first two doors are from the left exit, so when Mr. Black opened both of them only, there were two more closed door in the left exit and one closed door in the right exit. So Mr. Black wasn't able to exit at that moment.

When he opened the third door, all doors from the right exit became open, so Mr. Black was able to exit the house.

In the second example when the first two doors were opened, there was open closed door in each of the exit.

With three doors opened Mr. Black was able to use the left exit.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = map(int, raw_input().split())
    n = n[0]
    c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if c[i] != c[i + 1]:
            ans = i + 1
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `n` is at least 2, `c` is a list of integers, and `ans` is the index of the last position where `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`. If all elements in `c` are equal, `ans` remains 0. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains 0.
    print(ans)

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
