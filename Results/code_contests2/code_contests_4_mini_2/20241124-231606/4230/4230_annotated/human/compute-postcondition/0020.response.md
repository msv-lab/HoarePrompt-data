The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly; instead, it uses global or predefined variables for its operation. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 200,000\), and `c` is a list of integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing a sequence of doors opened by Mr. Black. 

The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and the list `c`, with specific conditions determining the output. However, the exact nature of the output is not detailed in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function relies on the integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a list c of integers (0 or 1), representing doors. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on their values.**
