The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 200,000, and `c` is a list of integers consisting of 0s and 1s. The line of code provided assigns a new value to `n` based on the output of `raw_input().split()`, which will accept a string input, split it into components, and then convert those components to integers using `map(int, ...)`. 

The exact transformation of `n` depends on the input provided by the user, which is not specified here. Therefore, we cannot determine the new value of `n` specifically, but we can note that `n` will now be a map object containing integers derived from user input. 

Since this transformation does not affect the list `c`, which remains unchanged, the output state will reflect the new state of `n` as a map object.

Output State: **`n` is a map object containing integers from input, `c` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1**
