Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, and `ans` is set to `n - 2`. If the element at index `i` (which is `n - 3`) is not equal to the element at index `i + 1`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` and the execution breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or if statement. If the elements at these indices are equal, no changes are made to `ans`.***
