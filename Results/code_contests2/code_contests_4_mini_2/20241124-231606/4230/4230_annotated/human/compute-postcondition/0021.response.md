The function `func` accepts no parameters. It reads two lines of input: the first line provides an integer `n`, which indicates the number of subsequent integers, and the second line consists of a list `c` of integers (0 or 1) representing doors. The function then processes these inputs to find the index of the last position where the current door state `c[i]` is not equal to the next door state `c[i + 1]`. If such a position exists, it assigns that index plus one to `ans`. If all elements in `c` are equal or if `n` is less than 2, `ans` remains 0. Finally, the function prints the value of `ans`.

Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `c` from input, then finds and prints the index of the last position where two consecutive elements in `c` differ. If all elements are the same or if `n` is less than 2, it prints 0. **
