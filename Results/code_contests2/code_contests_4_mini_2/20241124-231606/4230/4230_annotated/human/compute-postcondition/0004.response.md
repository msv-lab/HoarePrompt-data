According to the code, the loop will execute if `n - 2` is at least 0, which means `n` must be at least 2. The loop variable `i` starts from `n - 2` and decrements until it reaches -1. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to verify that `n` is at least 2. As for the values of `c` and `ans`, they do not directly impact the loop's execution condition but can be noted for completeness. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `n` must be at least 2, so `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- Given that `i` starts from `n - 2`, we can set `i` to `n - 2` at the start.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is now a list of integers derived from input, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`**
