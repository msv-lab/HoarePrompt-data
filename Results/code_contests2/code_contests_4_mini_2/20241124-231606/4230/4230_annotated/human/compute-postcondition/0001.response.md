The variable `n` is reassigned to `n[0]`, which means `n` will now hold the first element of the map object containing integers from input. The previous state of `n` as a map object is replaced by the value of `n[0]`. The variable `c` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input; `c` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1**
