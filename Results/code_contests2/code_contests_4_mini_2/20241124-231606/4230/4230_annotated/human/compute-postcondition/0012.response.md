Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, and `ans` is set to `0`. If `c[n - 2]` is not equal to `c[n - 1]`, then `ans` is updated to `n - 1`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[n - 2]` is equal to `c[n - 1]`, then `ans` remains `0` and the program continues without any break.***
