Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is set to `i + 1` (which is `n - 1`) if the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are not equal, indicating that a difference was found at the last two positions of the list. If the condition does not hold, `ans` remains 0, as there are no changes made to `ans` and the break statement is not executed.***
