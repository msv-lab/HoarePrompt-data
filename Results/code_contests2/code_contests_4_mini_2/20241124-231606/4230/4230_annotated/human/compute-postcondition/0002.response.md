The code assigns a new value to `c`, which is created from the output of `map(int, raw_input().split())`. `raw_input().split()` will accept a line of input, split it into separate strings, and `map(int, ...)` will convert those strings into integers. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. The output state will reflect that `c` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input; `c` is now a list of integers derived from input**
