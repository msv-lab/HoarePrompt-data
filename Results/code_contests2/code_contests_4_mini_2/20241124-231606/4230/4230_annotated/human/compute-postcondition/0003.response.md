The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables, `n` and `c`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input; `c` is now a list of integers derived from input; `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input; `c` is now a list of integers derived from input; `ans` is 0**
