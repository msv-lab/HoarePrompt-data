The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, the value of `ans` becomes `(n - 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`. The states of the other variables (`c` and `n`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `c` is a list of integers; `ans` is `n - 1`; `i` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2; `c` is a list of integers; `ans` is `n - 1`; `i` is `n - 2**
