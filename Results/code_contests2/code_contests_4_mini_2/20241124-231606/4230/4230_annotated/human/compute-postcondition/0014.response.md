The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. In the initial state, `i` is `n - 3`. Therefore, `ans` will be `n - 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 3`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 3**
