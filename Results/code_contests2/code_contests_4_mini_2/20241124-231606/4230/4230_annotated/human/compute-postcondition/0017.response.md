According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop runs as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the minimum value for `i` can be `-1` when `n` is exactly 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be changed to `n - 2`, which means the loop will start with `i` at `n - 2` instead of `n - 3`. Since `n` is at least 2, the maximum value of `i` can be `n - 2`.

Thus, we need to adjust `i` to `n - 2`. The other states (`c` and `ans`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not directly related to the loop condition.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is set to `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 2`**
