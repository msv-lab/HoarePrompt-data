The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, the value of `ans` will be `n - 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, and the element at index `i` of `c` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` of `c`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, and the element at index `i` of `c` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` of `c`.**
