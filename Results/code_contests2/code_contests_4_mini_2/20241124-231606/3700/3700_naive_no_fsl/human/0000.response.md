Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description correctly. It seems to be unrelated to the problem of calculating the minimum number of attacks Fennec needs to perform before winning. 

Specifically, the main issues are:

1. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3; it should use `input()`.
2. It calculates the sum of the monster health values but does not implement the logic to determine the number of attacks needed given the constraints of special moves (K).
3. The function `func_1` and `func_2` do not serve any purpose related to the problem statement.
4. The output is not related to the required output of the minimum number of attacks.

For an example, consider the input:
```
3 1
4 1 5
```
The expected output should be `5` (1 special move on the monster with health 5, and then 4 attacks on the monster with health 4), but the provided program would not produce this output nor even provide any relevant calculations.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
