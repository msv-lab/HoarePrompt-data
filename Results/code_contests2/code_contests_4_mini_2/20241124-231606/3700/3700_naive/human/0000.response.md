Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_2` simply checks if the sum of the health points of the monsters is greater than or equal to `H`, which is not relevant to the problem. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of Attack actions needed after allowing up to `K` Special Moves to reduce the health of all monsters to zero.

For instance, consider the input:
```
3 1
4 1 5
```
According to the problem description, Fennec can use 1 Special Move to reduce the health of the monster with health 5 to 0, and then will need to perform 5 Attack actions to reduce the other two monsters' healths (4 and 1) to zero. The correct output should be `5`. However, the provided program will produce 'No' because it incorrectly checks if the sum is greater than `H`.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements and will not work correctly for various inputs.
