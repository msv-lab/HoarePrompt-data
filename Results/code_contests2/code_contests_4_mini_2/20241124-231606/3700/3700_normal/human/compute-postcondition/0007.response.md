The function `func_2` accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and a list of integers `H` where each integer `H_i` corresponds to an element in the list and is within the specified range. `N` is an integer representing the number of elements in the list, and it must be between 1 and 200000. `K` is a non-negative integer that can be between 0 and 200000. Each element `H_i` in the list is an integer ranging from 1 to 10^9. 

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the specific return value without additional details. However, based on the constraints, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (an integer between 1 and 200000), K (a non-negative integer between 0 and 200000), and a list of integers H (containing N elements, each in the range [1, 10^9]).**
