Postcondition: ***`H` is a list of integers, `N` is an integer in the range [1, 200000], and `s` is the sum of integers from user input. If `s` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `H`, the output is 'Yes'. Otherwise, if `s` is less than the sum of the elements in `H`, the output is 'No'.***
