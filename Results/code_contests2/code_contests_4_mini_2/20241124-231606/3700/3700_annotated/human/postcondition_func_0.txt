The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, calculates their sum `c`, and returns `c` reduced by `mod` if `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`; otherwise, it returns `c` unchanged. Note that the variable `mod` must be defined elsewhere in the code for this function to work correctly, and if `mod` is not defined, it will raise a NameError.
