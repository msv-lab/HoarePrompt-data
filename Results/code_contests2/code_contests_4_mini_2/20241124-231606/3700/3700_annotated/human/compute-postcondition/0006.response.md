Postcondition: ***`H` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `N` is a positive integer, and `s` is the sum of the input integers. If `s` is greater than or equal to the total health represented by the sum of the elements in `H`, the function prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, if `s` is less than the total health of the monsters, the function prints 'No'.***
