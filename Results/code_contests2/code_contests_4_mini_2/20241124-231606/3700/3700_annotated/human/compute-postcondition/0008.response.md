Functionality: ** The function accepts two inputs: a list of integers representing the health of monsters and a count of these monsters. It calculates the sum of another list of integers (which is expected to be supplied) and compares this sum to the total health of the monsters. If the sum is greater than or equal to the total health, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not handle cases where the input might not be integers or where the health list might be empty. **
