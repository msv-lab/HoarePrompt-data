The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly in its definition. Instead, it operates on the variables that are presumably defined within its scope. Based on the constraints provided, `N` is a positive integer representing the number of monsters, `K` is a non-negative integer, and `H_i` are positive integers representing the health of each monster.

The output of the function is not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, it can be inferred that the function processes the health values of the monsters and possibly returns a result based on the values of `N`, `K`, and the list of health values `H_i`.

Since the specific return value or cases are not outlined, we can summarize the general expectation:

Functionality: **The function operates on a set of positive integers representing the number of monsters and their health values, returning a result based on these inputs and conditions defined within the function.**
