Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the logic necessary to solve the problem as described. 

1. The first function `func_1` seems to handle addition and modular arithmetic but is not relevant to the problem of calculating the minimum number of attacks needed by Fennec to defeat the monsters.
  
2. The second function `func_2` checks if the sum of some input integers is greater than or equal to another integer `H`, which does not relate to the problem of using a limited number of special moves to reduce the health of monsters. Specifically, it does not consider the health values of each monster nor does it account for the maximum number of special moves (`K`) allowed.

For example, given the input:
```
3 1
4 1 5
```
The expected output is `5`, as Fennec can use one special move on the monster with health 5, reducing the total attacks needed to defeat the other monsters. However, `func_2` fails to compute this correctly as it doesn't handle the mechanics of health reduction based on the number of special moves available.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem description and cannot handle the edge cases that arise from different values of `H` and the varying number of monsters.
