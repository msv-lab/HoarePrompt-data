To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description
Luba has `n` days and a total of `t` seconds required to read a book. For each day `i`, she has to work for `a[i]` seconds. The total seconds available for reading on day `i` is `86400 - a[i]`. The goal is to find the minimum day on which Luba can finish reading the book.

### Code Analysis
The provided code is as follows:
```python
(n, t) = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
a = raw_input().split()
i = 0
while t > 0:
    t -= 86400 - int(a[i])
    i += 1
print(i)
```

### Logical Flow of the Code
1. The program reads two integers `n` and `t`.
2. It reads an array `a` which contains the seconds Luba works each day.
3. It initializes `i` to 0 to track the days.
4. It enters a loop that continues until `t` (time left to read) is greater than 0.
5. In each iteration of the loop, it subtracts the available reading time for that day (`86400 - a[i]`) from `t`.
6. It increments `i` to check the next day.
7. Finally, it prints `i`, which represents the day on which Luba finishes reading.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues
To verify the correctness, we need to consider edge cases:

1. **Case with maximum work time**: If `a = [86400]` and `t = 1`, the expected output should be `1` since Luba can read 0 seconds on that day and she won't finish reading.
2. **Case with zero work time**: If `a = [0]` and `t = 86401`, the expected output should be `1` since she can read 86400 seconds on the first day but won't finish, requiring more days.
3. **Case with multiple days**: Consider `a = [86400, 86400]` and `t = 1`. The expected output is `1` since she cannot read in either day.
4. **Case with exactly enough time**: If `a = [86400, 86399]` and `t = 1`, the expected output is `2` since she would finish reading on the second day.

### Issues Found
Upon careful examination, the code does not handle the case where Luba's work time equals or exceeds 86400 seconds properly. If Luba works for 86400 seconds or more in any day, the code would attempt to subtract an already exhausted reading time, leading to an incorrect result.

**Example of failure**:
- Input: 
  ```
  1 1
  86400
  ```
- The output would be `1`, but the actual result should indicate that she cannot finish reading because she has no time left to read.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when Luba works for 86400 seconds or more. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
