The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` will be 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `a`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[0]))`, `a` is a list of strings from input, `i` is 1**
