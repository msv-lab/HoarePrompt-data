The variable `a` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which means it will hold a list of strings obtained from user input, split by whitespace. The initial state of `n` and `t` is not directly affected by this operation, but the value of `a` will be a list of string inputs. Since the values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged, the output state reflects the new variable `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of strings from input**
