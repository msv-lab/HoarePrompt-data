The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is an integer such that 0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400. 

The output and specific functionality of the function are not provided in the example. Therefore, it's not possible to define the exact return values or cases. However, based on the constraints alone, the function operates on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function operates on parameters n (an integer between 1 and 100), t (an integer between 1 and 10^6), and a (a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 86400), but does not accept any parameters directly. The specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
