The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It reads two integers `n` and `t` from the input, where `n` represents the number of time intervals and `t` represents a total time value. It then reads a list `a` of `n` integers, each representing time intervals. The function iteratively decreases `t` by the difference between `86400` and the values from the list `a` until `t` is no longer positive or all elements of `a` have been processed. The variable `i` counts how many elements from `a` have been used in the operation, and finally, the function prints the count of used elements.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `t` is less than or equal to 0 before the loop starts, the loop does not execute, and `i` remains 0.
- The input values for `n` are limited between 1 and 100, and for `t`, between 1 and 10^6, which the code does not explicitly handle beyond reading.

Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `t`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It processes the list to decrement `t` until it either becomes non-positive or all list elements are used, counting how many elements were used, and prints this count. If `t` starts at 0 or negative, it immediately prints 0. **
