The value of `t` is reduced by `86400 - int(a[i])`, where `int(a[i])` converts the string at index `i` of the list `a` into an integer. The previous value of `t` is not specified, but it must be within the range of `1` to `10^6`. The value of `a[i]` is not specified, but it is a valid string representation of an integer. 

The new value of `t` will depend on the specific values of `t` and `a[i]`. Since `i` is initially `0`, the expression becomes:

```
t = t - (86400 - int(a[0]))
```

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `t` after this calculation, along with the states of `n`, `a`, and `i` which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[0]))`, `a` is a list of strings from input, `i` is 0**
