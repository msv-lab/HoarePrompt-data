The value of `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`. Since `i` is 2, we will be using the value `a[2]` which is a string that will be converted to an integer. The initial state of `t` is greater than `86400 - int(a[1])`, but the specific values of `t` and `a[2]` are not provided. Thus, we cannot determine the exact new value of `t` after the operation, but we can state that it is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[2]))`, `a` is a list of strings from input, `i` is 2**
