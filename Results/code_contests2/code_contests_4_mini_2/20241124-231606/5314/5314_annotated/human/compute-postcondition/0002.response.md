The variable `i` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of strings from input, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of strings from input, and `i` is 0**
