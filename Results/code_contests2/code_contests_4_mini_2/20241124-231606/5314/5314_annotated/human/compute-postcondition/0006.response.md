The value of `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`. The variable `i` has a value of 1, so `a[i]` corresponds to `a[1]`. The value of `int(a[1])` will be an integer representation of the second string in the list `a`. The previous value of `t` is greater than `86400 - int(a[0])`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `t` after this calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[1]))`, `a` is a list of strings from input, `i` is 1**
