The code assigns values to `n` and `t` using `raw_input()`, which will read a line of input and split it into two parts before converting them to integers. The values of `n` and `t` will depend on the input provided but will be integers within the specified ranges. The list `a` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects only the updated values of `n` and `t` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6**
