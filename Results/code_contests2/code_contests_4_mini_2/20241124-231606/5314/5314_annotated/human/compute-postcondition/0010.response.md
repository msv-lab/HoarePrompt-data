The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was initially 2, it becomes 3 after execution. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[2]))`, `a` is a list of strings from input, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[2]))`, `a` is a list of strings from input, `i` is 3**
