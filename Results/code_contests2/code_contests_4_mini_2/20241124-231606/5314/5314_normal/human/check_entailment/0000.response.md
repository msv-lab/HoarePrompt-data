Let's analyze the provided program in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- Luba has `n` days and she needs `t` seconds to read a book.
- Each day, she has a certain amount of work time, `a[i]`, which means she can read for `86400 - a[i]` seconds that day.
- We need to determine the minimum day she can finish reading the book.

### Analyzing the Program:
```python
(n, t) = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
a = raw_input().split()
i = 0
while t > 0:
    t -= 86400 - int(a[i])
    i += 1
print(i)
```

1. The program reads `n` and `t` correctly and stores the work times in list `a`.
2. It initializes a counter `i` to keep track of the days.
3. The while loop continues subtracting available reading time (`86400 - a[i]`) from `t` until `t` is no longer positive.
4. It increments `i` for each day processed.
5. Finally, it prints `i`, which represents the day Luba finishes reading.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When `t` is already 0 or negative**: 
   - The program does not handle this case effectively. If `t` starts as 0, it should ideally return 0 immediately indicating that sheâ€™s already done reading, but it will still try to process days leading to an index error if `n` is reached.
  
2. **All work times equal to 86400**:
   - If all values in `a` are 86400, Luba cannot read any time and `t` will never decrease, leading to an infinite loop since `t` will remain positive.

3. **Maximum `t` with minimum reading time available**:
   - For example, if `t` is very large but the available reading time is consistently small, the program should correctly count the number of days until `t` is exhausted.

### Output Hints:
- The output hints suggest that if `t` starts as non-positive, it returns 0 without processing any intervals.
- They also mention that the function does not handle exceptions related to input validity or incorrect formats.

### Conclusion:
The code does not handle the cases where `t` is initially zero or when all work times equal to 86400. This leads to incorrect behavior in both scenarios, as it might result in an incorrect day count or an infinite loop.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases where `t` is initially zero and the scenario where all work times allow for no reading.
