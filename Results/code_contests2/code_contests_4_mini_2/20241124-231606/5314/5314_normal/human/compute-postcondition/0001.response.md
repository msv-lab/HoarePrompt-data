The line of code `a = raw_input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it by whitespace, and assigns the resulting list of strings to the variable `a`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code. The output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `t` alongside the new variable `a` that holds the split input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6, and `a` is a list of strings from input.**
