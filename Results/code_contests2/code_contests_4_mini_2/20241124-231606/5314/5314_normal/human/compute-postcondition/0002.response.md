The variable `i` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected by this line of code. The values of `n`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of strings from input, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of strings from input, and `i` is 0**
