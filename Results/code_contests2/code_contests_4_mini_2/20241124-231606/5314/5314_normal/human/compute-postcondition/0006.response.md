The value of `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`. The initial value of `t` is greater than `86400 - int(a[0])`, but the exact values of `t`, `a`, and `i` are not provided. The value of `i` is 1, so the calculation will involve `a[1]`. 

The new value of `t` will be `t - (86400 - int(a[1]))`, but we don't know the exact values of `t` and `a[1]`. Therefore, the output state will indicate the operation performed on `t`, along with the affected variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is decreased by (86400 - int(a[1])), `a` is a list of strings from input, `i` is 1**
