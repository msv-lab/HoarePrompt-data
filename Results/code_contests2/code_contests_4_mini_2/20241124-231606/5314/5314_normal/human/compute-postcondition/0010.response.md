The variable `i` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `i` is 2, after execution, `i` will be 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, and `a`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decreased by `86400 - int(a[2])`; `a` is a list of strings from input; `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decreased by `86400 - int(a[2])`; `a` is a list of strings from input; `i` is 3**
