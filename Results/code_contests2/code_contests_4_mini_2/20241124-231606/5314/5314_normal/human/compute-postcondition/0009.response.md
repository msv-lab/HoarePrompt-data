The value of `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`. The value of `i` is 2, thus we need to evaluate `int(a[2])` to determine the impact on `t`. The current state indicates that `t` is greater than `86400 - int(a[1])` but does not provide specific values for `t`, `a`, or `n`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationship and calculation involving `t` without stating specific values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decreased by `86400 - int(a[2])`; `a` is a list of strings from input; `i` is 2**.
