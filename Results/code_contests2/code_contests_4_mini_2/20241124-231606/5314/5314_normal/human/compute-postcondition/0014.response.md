The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `t`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^6\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 86400\).

The function does not return any specific output mentioned in the provided information, so the exact return value is not specified. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` (with constraints on its value), an integer `t` (within its own constraints), and a list `a` of `n` integers (each within a defined range). The function processes these inputs but does not specify a return value based on the provided details. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 100), t (an integer between 1 and 10^6), and a (a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 86400).**
