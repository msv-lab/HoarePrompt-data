Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `t`, where `n` is the number of time intervals and `t` is a total time value in seconds. It then reads `n` integers representing time intervals. The function calculates how many intervals can be subtracted from `t` based on the formula `t -= (86400 - int(a[i]))` for each interval until `t` becomes non-positive. It returns the count of intervals processed before `t` becomes non-positive. If `t` starts as non-positive, it returns 0 immediately without processing any intervals. The function does not handle any exceptions related to input validity or incorrect formats.**
