The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables `n`, `t`, and `a` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is decreased by (86400 - int(a[1])), `a` is a list of strings from input, `i` is 2**
