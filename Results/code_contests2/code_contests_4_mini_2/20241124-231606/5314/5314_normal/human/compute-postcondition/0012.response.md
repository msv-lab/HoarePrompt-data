Output State: **`if t is positive, then t is decreased by the sum of (86400 - int(a[j])) for j from 0 to i-1, and i is equal to the number of iterations completed; if t becomes non-positive at any point, the loop stops executing. If t starts as non-positive, the loop does not execute and remains unchanged, while i remains 0.`**
