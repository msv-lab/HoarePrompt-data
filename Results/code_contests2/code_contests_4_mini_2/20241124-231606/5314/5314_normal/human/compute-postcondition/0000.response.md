The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `n` and `t`. The `input` function reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts those parts into integers. The previous values of `n` and `t` are unknown as they are being assigned new values based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6, and the values of `n` and `t` are updated based on the input.**
