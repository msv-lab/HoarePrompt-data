Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description:
Luba wants to finish reading a book that takes `t` seconds, while on each of the `n` days, she has `a[i]` seconds of work. The total time available for reading each day is `86400 - a[i]`. We need to determine the minimum day when Luba finishes reading the book.

### Program:
```python
(n, t) = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
a = raw_input().split()
i = 0
while t > 0:
    t -= 86400 - int(a[i])
    i += 1
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The first line reads `n` and `t`, which is correct.
   - The second line reads `a`, but it does not convert the elements to integers. This will cause a type error during the subtraction in the loop, as `a[i]` will be a string and needs to be converted to an integer.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop continues to subtract the available reading time `86400 - a[i]` from `t`. However, if Luba finishes reading on the last day, it needs to check whether `i` exceeds the bounds of the list `a`.
   - If `t` is not finished before reaching `n`, the program will result in an `IndexError` since it will attempt to access an index that does not exist once `i` reaches `n`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all `a[i]` values are `86400` (meaning Luba has no time to read), the program will not handle this properly as it will immediately attempt to subtract from `t` and may not terminate correctly.
   - There is no check to handle when `t` becomes less than or equal to zero before incrementing `i`, which could lead to an incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
Given the errors in type handling and the potential for an `IndexError`, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.

### Example of Failure:
For example, if the input is:
```
3 100
86400 86400 86400
```
The program would attempt to access `a[3]` when `i` becomes `3`, which would lead to an `IndexError`. Therefore, it fails to handle this case correctly.
