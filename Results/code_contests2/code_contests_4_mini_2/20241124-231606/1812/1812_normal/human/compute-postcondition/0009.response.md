Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f', `S` is the input string, `N` is the integer value of `S` excluding the last character, `C` is the result of `ord(S[-1]) - ord('a'), and `M` is calculated as (N - 1) & 3. If `M` is either 1 or 2, then `N` is adjusted by subtracting `M`, and `M` is toggled using XOR with 3 before adding it back to `N`. If `M` is not in (1, 2), then `N` remains unchanged.***
