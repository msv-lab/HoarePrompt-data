To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet based on the initial state. 

1. We have `N`, which is the integer value of the string `S` excluding the last character. 
2. The character `C` is derived from the last character of `S` using `ord(S[-1]) - ord('a')`.
3. The variable `M` is calculated as `(N - 1) & 3`.
4. The print statement computes a final result based on `N` and `C`.

We will not adjust `N` or `M` based on whether `M` is either 1 or 2, as that requires the specific values of `N` and `M`. However, we can still compute the expression directly with the provided values.

The print statement is:
```
print((N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C))
```

The output state will depend on the values of `N` and `C`, but since we don't have specific values, we will summarize it as follows:

Output State: **`N` is the integer value of `S` excluding the last character, `C` is the result of `ord(S[-1]) - ord('a'), and the final result is calculated from the expression.**
