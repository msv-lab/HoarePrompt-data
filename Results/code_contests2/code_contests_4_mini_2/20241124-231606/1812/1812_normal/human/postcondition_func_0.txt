The function accepts a string input consisting of a positive integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18) followed by a character `s` from 'a' to 'f'. It calculates a specific value based on `N` and `s`, adjusting `N` based on the binary representation of `(N - 1) & 3`. Finally, it computes and prints a result based on the modified `N` and the position of `s`, without returning any value. The function handles cases where `s` is not within the specified range, but the behavior in such cases is not explicitly defined in the logic.
