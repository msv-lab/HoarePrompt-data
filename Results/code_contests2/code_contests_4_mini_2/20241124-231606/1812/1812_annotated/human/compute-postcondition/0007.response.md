The code `M ^= 3` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `M` and `3`. Since `M` can be either `1` or `2`, we can calculate the results for both possible values of `M`:

- If `M` is `1`: 
  - `1 XOR 3` equals `2` (in binary: `01 XOR 11 = 10`).
  
- If `M` is `2`: 
  - `2 XOR 3` equals `1` (in binary: `10 XOR 11 = 01`).

Thus, the output state will reflect the possible values of `M` after the operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18); `s` is a character representing a seat in the row; `N` is either the previous value of `N - 1` or `N - 2`; `C` is calculated as `ord(S[-1]) - ord('a'); `M` is either 1 or 2, and after operation `M` is either 1 or 2.**
