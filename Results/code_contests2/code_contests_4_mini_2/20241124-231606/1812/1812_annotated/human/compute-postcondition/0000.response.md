The code defines a lambda function `gets` that reads a line from standard input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace with `strip()`, and returns the result. The variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged since this code does not modify them. Therefore, the output state remains the same with respect to `n` and `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `s` is a character representing a seat in the row, which can be one of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'**
