Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18); `s` is a character representing a seat in the row; `N` is initially assigned the value of `int(S[:-1])`, and `C` is calculated as `ord(S[-1]) - ord('a');` `M` is calculated as `N - 1 & 3`. If `M` is either 1 or 2, then `N` is updated by first reducing its value by `M`, flipping `M` with the XOR operation against 3, and finally increasing `N` by this new `M`, resulting in `N` being either `N + 1` or `N + 2`. If `M` is neither 1 nor 2, the values of `N` and `M` remain unchanged.***
