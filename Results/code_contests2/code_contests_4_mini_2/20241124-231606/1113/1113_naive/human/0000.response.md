Correctness: **False**.

The provided program attempts to create an anti-sudoku by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1'. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting grid will satisfy the conditions of an anti-sudoku. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
999999999
999999999
999999999
999999999
999999999
999999999
999999999
999999999
999999999
```
After applying the program, the output would be:
```
111111111
111111111
111111111
111111111
111111111
111111111
111111111
111111111
111111111
```
This output does meet the condition of having at least two equal elements in each row, column, and 3x3 block, but it does not adhere to the requirement of changing at most 9 elements. The program changed every '9' in the input, which is more than the allowed 9 changes.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the problem requirements regarding the maximum number of elements that can be changed.
