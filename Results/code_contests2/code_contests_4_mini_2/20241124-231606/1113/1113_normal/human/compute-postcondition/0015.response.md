The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is not '9', the new value of `nRow` will be equal to `i`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `i` is not '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `i` is not '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is equal to `i`**
