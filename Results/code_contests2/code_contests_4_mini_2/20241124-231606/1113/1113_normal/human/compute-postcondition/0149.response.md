The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to the existing string in `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` is updated to contain '1' and `i` is the third element of `row`, which has not been specified but is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `nRow` will now include whatever value `i` holds in addition to its previous contents. Other variables are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`res` contains 18 strings with every '9' replaced by '1', `i` is the third element of `row`, `nRow` is updated to include `i`, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, and `row` contains at least 3 elements**
