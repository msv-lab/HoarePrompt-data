The code assigns an empty string to `nRow`. This means that the previous value of `nRow`, which was derived from replacing '9' with '1' in `row`, is now lost, and `nRow` will be an empty string. The values of `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`nRow` is '', `res` includes the updated `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is an input string**
