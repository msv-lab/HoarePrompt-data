Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is either '9' or not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated such that if `i` is '9', `nRow` becomes '1'; otherwise, `nRow` becomes equal to the value of `i`.***
