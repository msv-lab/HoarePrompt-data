Postcondition: ***`row` is a non-empty string. If the first character of `row` (i) is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is set to the first character of `row`. This means `nRow` will either be '1' (when `i` is '9') or it will take the value of the first character of `row` (for all other cases).***
