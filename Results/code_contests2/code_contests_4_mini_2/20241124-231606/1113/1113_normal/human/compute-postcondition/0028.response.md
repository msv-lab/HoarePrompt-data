According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop is set to iterate 9 times, starting from `i = 0` up to `i = 8`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum value of 8 (since the loop runs while `i < 9`). 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to 9. However, since the loop condition is `i < 9`, when `i` reaches 9, the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is that `i` must be incremented to 9. No other states need adjustment because the loop has already processed `nRow` and `res` as required.

State: **`nRow` is formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', and all other characters in `row` are added to `nRow` unchanged; `res` now contains `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9**
