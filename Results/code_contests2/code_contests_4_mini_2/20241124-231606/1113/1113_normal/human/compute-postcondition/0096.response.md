The value of `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it. Previously, `nRow` was an empty string, so after the execution, `nRow` will now be '1'. The other variables (`res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, and `row`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string**
