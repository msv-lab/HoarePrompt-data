The variable `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is the second character of `row`, which is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters. However, since the initial value of `nRow` is not provided, we cannot determine its specific new value after the increment. Therefore, the output state indicates that `nRow` is increased by `i`, and we acknowledge the existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i`.**
