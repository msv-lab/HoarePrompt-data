The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to `nRow`. Given the initial state, `nRow` is a string formed by replacing '9' with '1' in the first element of `row`, and `i` is the first element of `row`, which is not equal to '9'. Therefore, `i` is being concatenated to `nRow`.

Since `nRow` will now include the value of `i`, the output state will reflect this change. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` contains 18 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` contains at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `row`, `i` is not equal to '9', and `nRow` is updated to include `i`.**
