The variable `nRow` is updated by concatenating the value of `i` to it. Since `i` is the third character of `row`, the value of `i` is a specific character from the string `row`. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but it will now include the character `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a string with at least 3 characters; `i` is the third character of `row`; `nRow` is updated to include `i`.

Output State: **`row` is a string with at least 3 characters; `i` is the third character of `row`; `nRow` is updated to include `i**
