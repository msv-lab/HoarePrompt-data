According to the code, the loop iterates over a range of 9. The variable `i` controls the number of iterations, starting from 0 up to 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 9. 

However, since the loop body has been omitted, we cannot determine the exact state of `i` at the end of the last iteration based solely on the provided information. We will assume the last value of `i` was 8, which means it is now equal to 9 at the start of the next iteration.

To allow the loop to execute again, `i` must be adjusted to be less than 9. Therefore, we will set `i` to 9 (the condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than 9). There are no other states mentioned that need to be adjusted.

State: **`nRow` is a string that results from replacing '9' with '1' in `row`, `res` now includes the updated `nRow`, `i` is 9**
