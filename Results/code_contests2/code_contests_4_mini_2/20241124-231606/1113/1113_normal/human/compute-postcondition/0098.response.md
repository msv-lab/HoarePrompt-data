The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the current value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` starts as an empty string and `i` is not equal to '9', the value of `nRow` will now contain the value of `i`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is now equal to `i`, `res` contains 9 strings where every '9' is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is now equal to `i`, `res` contains 9 strings where every '9' is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, and `row` is a non-empty string.**
