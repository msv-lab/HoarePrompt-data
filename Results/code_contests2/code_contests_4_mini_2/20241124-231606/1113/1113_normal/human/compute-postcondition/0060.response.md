Postcondition: ***`nRow` includes the updated value based on the evaluation of `i` and `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character available. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to its previous value. In all cases, the length of `nRow` increases by 1, and `row` remains unchanged.***
