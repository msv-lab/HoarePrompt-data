The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string `'1'`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be `'1'`. The variable `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`, which was an empty string, and it gets updated to include this new value. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is independent of this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `res` is an empty string concatenated with '1', so `res` is '1', `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` is '1', `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string**
