Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string that contains the character `i` appended to its original value, with an additional '1' if `i` is '9'. `res` contains 9 strings with '9' replaced by '1'. `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after the current `i`, and `i` is the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` will end with '1', otherwise `nRow` will have `i` appended to it. In the case where `i` is equal to '9', the total length of `nRow` increases by one, while if `i` is any character other than '9', the last character is `i` appended, thus ensuring `nRow` is updated appropriately.***
