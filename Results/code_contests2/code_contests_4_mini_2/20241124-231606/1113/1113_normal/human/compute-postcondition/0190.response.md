Postcondition: ***`row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to include '1' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to include `i`, which is appended to its previous value. In both cases, `res` retains the previous value of `nRow`.***
