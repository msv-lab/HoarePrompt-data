The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`, which is the next character in `row`. Since `row` has at least one more character, `i` will have a specific value (a character). The previous state of `nRow` is updated by this character's value, but since the exact numeric value isn't provided, we can state that `nRow` is increased by the numeric equivalent of the character `i`. Other variables such as `res`, `T`, `t`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` has at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` has at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`.**
