The value of `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the operation, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables `row`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, and `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, and `i` is '9'**
