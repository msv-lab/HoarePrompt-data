The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i` to it. Since `nRow` was previously a string and `res` holds its previous value, `nRow` now becomes `res + i`. The other variables (`res`, `row`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is `res + i`, `res` is the previous value of `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is `res + i`, `res` is the previous value of `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
