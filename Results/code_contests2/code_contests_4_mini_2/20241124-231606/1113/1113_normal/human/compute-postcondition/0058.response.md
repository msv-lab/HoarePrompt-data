The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` includes an updated value based on the evaluation of `i`, its exact value is not specified, but it is guaranteed to be a string. The `row` variable, being a non-empty string, remains unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` includes the updated value based on the evaluation of `i` followed by '1'; `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character available.

Output State: **`nRow` includes the updated value based on the evaluation of `i` followed by '1'; `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character available**.
