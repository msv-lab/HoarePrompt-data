According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row` variable. If `row` contains more elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `row` contains at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element of `row`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `row` needs to have at least 2 elements, and `i` should be updated to the second element in the `row`.

State: **`res` contains 18 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `row`, and `nRow` is updated accordingly based on the new value of `i`.**
