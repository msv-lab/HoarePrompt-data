The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to it. The exact previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but since `row` is a non-empty string, it doesn't affect the operation. The state of the other variables is not changed. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` includes the updated value after appending '1', `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character available, and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` includes the updated value after appending '1', `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character available, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
