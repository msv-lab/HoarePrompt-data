The code appends the character `'1'` to `nRow`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`, so we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `nRow` is now `nRow` with an appended `'1'`, but we cannot specify its exact state due to the lack of initial information.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `i` is the second character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `nRow` is now `nRow` + '1'**
