The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string `'1'` to its current value. The other variables (`res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow` while the rest of the variables maintain their previous states.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` has at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` has been appended with '1'.**
