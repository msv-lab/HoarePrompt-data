The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` is a string containing the character `i`, after this operation, `nRow` will contain two `i` characters. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` now contains two `i` characters, `res` contains 9 strings with '9' replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after current `i`.

Output State: **`nRow` contains two `i` characters, `res` contains 9 strings with '9' replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after current `i`**
