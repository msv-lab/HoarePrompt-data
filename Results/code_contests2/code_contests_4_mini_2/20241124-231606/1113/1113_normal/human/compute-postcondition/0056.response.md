Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string that includes the updated value based on the evaluation of `i`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to include '1'; otherwise, if `i` is any other value (including '0'), `nRow` is updated to include the value of `i`. The variable `res` includes the updated `nRow`, and `row` remains a non-empty string.***
