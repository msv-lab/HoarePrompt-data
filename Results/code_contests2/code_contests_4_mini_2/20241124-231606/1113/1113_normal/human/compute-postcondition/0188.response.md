The code `nRow += '1'` appends the character '1' to the current value of `nRow`. Since this operation does not change the value of `i` or `res`, and we only know that `nRow` is updated to include '1' or concatenated with `i` previously, we can conclude that `nRow` will now include '1' added to its existing value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated to include '1', and `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`**
