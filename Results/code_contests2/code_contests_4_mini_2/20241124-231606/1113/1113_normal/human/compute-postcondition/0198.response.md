Output State: **`res` contains `T * 9` strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', and all other characters remain unchanged; if `T` is 0, `res` remains an empty list; if any input `row` is empty during execution, `nRow` will be an empty string appended to `res`; the output will be the joined string of `res` using newline characters.**
