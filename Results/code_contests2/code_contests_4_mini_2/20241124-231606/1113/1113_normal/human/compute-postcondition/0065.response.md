According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `row` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`, and since `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character available, the loop can execute again.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we can conclude that `i` should be set to the next character in `row`. Additionally, the length of `row` must reduce by one for each iteration since we are iterating through the characters.

Thus, we need to adjust:
- `i` to the next character in `row`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `nRow`'s value is based on the last character processed and does not affect the iteration condition for the next character in `row`.

State: **`nRow` includes the updated value after appending either '1' if `i` is '9' or the character `i` if it is not '9', `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, and `i` is the next character in `row`.**
