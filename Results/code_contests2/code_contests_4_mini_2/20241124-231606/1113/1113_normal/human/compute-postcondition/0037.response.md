According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string. The variable `i` represents the current character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` becomes '1' and does not change on subsequent iterations, while `res` remains unchanged. If `i` is any character other than '9', `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it, and `res` then contains the previous value of `nRow`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `row` still has characters to iterate over. Since `row` is a non-empty string at the end of the last iteration, we can conclude that it had at least one character and that we are now at the last character. This means we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` would now be the next character in `row` (if it exists), or there would be no characters left to iterate over.

We need to ensure that `row` contains at least one more character for the loop to continue. If it does, we will need to update `i` accordingly.

State: **`nRow` is a string, `res` is the previous value of `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`**.
