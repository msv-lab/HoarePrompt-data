The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since `i` is the second element of `row`, and `row` contains at least 2 elements, `i` has a defined value. The initial state does not specify the value of `nRow`, but it will be affected by adding `i` to it. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `nRow` after the increment.

Output State: **`res` contains 18 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `row`, and `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`.**
