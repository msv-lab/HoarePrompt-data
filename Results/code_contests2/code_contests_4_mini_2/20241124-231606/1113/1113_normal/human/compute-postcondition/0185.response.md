The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is the next character in `row`. Since `nRow` remains unchanged before this operation, the new value of `nRow` will be its previous value concatenated with `i`. The state of the other variables does not change. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is now updated to include `i`, and `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated to include `i`, `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`**
