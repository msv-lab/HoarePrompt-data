According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must not be an empty string; it should contain at least one character. Additionally, at the start of the loop, `i` is initialized to 0, which is fine, but it will be updated to the first character of `row` during the first iteration. 

Given that `nRow` is an empty string, it does not affect the execution of the loop. The states that need to be adjusted are primarily focused on ensuring that `row` has content.

State: **`res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string**
