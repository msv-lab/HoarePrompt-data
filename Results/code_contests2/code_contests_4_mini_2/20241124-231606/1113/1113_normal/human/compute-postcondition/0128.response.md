According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least one more character than it had at the end of the last iteration, and `i` must represent that character. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `row` has at least one more character, and `i` is currently the next character in `row`. Thus, in order for the loop to run again, `row` must have at least one additional character beyond what has already been processed. 

Since `row` is already confirmed to have at least one more character, and `i` is the next character in that row, we can conclude that `i` needs to be updated to reflect the next character in the row for the next iteration.

Thus, we need to adjust the state for `i` to be the next character in `row`, but we don't need to adjust `nRow`, `res`, `T`, `t`, or the condition regarding `row`, since they already meet the requirements for the next iteration.

State: **`nRow` is updated, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` has at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`**
