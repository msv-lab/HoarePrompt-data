According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. The loop will execute for each character in `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string at the end of the last iteration, it had at least one character, and `i` was the first character of `row`.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must refer to the next character in `row`. If `row` is of length `k`, and `i` was the first character (index 0) during the last iteration, then `i` must now be the second character (index 1) for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `i` is now the second character of `row`. The value of `nRow` depends on the updated value of `i`. If the first character was '9', `nRow` would be '1', and if the first character was not '9', `nRow` would take the value of the second character of `row`. 

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the second character of `row`**
