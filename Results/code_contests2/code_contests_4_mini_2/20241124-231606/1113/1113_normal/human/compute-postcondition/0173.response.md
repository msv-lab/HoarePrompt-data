The code appends `nRow` to the list `res`. The variable `nRow`, in this context, is derived from `row` by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', while all other characters remain unchanged. Since `row` is specified as a non-empty string, `nRow` will be a modified version of it. The values of `res` before this operation are not specified, but we can infer that `res` is a list that will now contain the new value `nRow`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the modified string with '9' replaced by '1', and `res` now includes `nRow`.**
