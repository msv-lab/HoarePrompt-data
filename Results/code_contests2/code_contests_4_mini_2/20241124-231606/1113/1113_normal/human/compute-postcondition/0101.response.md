The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the character `'1'` to it. The current value of `nRow` is a string that contains the character `i`, so after execution, `nRow` will be `i1`. The other variables (`res`, `T`, `t`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is now `i1`, `res` contains 9 strings with '9' replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after current `i`.

Output State: **`nRow` is now `i1`, `res` contains 9 strings with '9' replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after current `i`**.
