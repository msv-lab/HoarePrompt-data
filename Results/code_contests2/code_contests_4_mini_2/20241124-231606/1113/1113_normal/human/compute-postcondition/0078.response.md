The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` to it. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string and `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` will now hold the value of `i`. The previous values of the affected variables are `nRow` (which was an empty string) and `i` (which is not equal to '9'). Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now equal to `i`**
