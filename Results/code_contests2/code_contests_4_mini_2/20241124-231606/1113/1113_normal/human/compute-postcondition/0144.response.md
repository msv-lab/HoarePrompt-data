The string `nRow` is incremented by adding '1' to its current value. Since `nRow` is updated based on the new value of `i`, which is the second element of `row`, the previous state of `nRow` is unknown, but it will now include the new character '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 18 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `row`, and `nRow` is updated with '1' added to its previous value.
