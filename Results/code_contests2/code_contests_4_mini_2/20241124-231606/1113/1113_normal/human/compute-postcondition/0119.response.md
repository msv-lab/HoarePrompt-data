Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string. If the first character of `row` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by concatenating the first character of `row`, which is not '9', to the existing value of `nRow`, thus preserving its content while ensuring it is not '1' in this case. In both scenarios, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, and `row` is a non-empty string.***
