According to the code, the loop executes for each character in the string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, the loop can continue executing as long as there are more characters to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character of `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to the third character of `row`. Additionally, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, which means it will append either '1' if `i` is '9' or the value of `i` itself.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to confirm that there is at least one more character in `row` after the second character. This means that `row` must have at least three characters in total.

Therefore, the adjusted state will reflect that `row` has at least three characters, `i` is now the third character of `row`, and `nRow` would be updated accordingly based on this new value of `i`.

State: **`row` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`.**
