The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the current value of `nRow` (which is an empty string) with the value of `i` (the first character of `row`). Since `nRow` starts as an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will contain the value of `i`. The other variable `row` remains unchanged, and `i` still holds the first character of `row` which is not equal to '9'. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is equal to the first character of `row`, and `i` is the first character of `row`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`**
