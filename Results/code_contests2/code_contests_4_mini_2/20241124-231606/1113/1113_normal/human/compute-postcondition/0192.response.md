Output State: **`nRow` is a string that replaces every '9' in `row` with '1' and retains all other characters as they are. `res` retains its previous value. If `row` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string. If `row` contains '9', those will be converted to '1' in `nRow`. Otherwise, `nRow` will be a copy of `row` with '9' replaced.**
