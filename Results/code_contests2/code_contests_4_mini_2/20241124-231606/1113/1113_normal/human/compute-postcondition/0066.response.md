Output State: **`nRow` is a string where every occurrence of '9' in `row` is replaced with '1', and all other characters are retained in their original order. The length of `nRow` is equal to the length of `row`. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string. In this case, `res` would also be an empty string, reflecting the unchanged state of `nRow`.**
