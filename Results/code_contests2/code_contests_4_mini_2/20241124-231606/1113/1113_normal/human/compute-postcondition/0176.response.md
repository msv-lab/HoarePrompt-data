The code assigns an empty string `''` to `nRow`. This means that the previous value of `nRow` (which was a modified string with '9' replaced by '1') is overwritten. The other variables (`row`, `res`, and `i`) remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a new non-empty string based on user input, `nRow` is now '', `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 8.

Output State: **`row` is a new non-empty string based on user input, `nRow` is now '', `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 8**
