The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1', altering its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is a string concatenated with '1', `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string concatenated with '1', `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`**
