According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least one more character available, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character available. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `row` must have at least one additional character remaining after the current character being processed. 

Since `i` iterates over the characters of `row`, and it is implied that `i` could be one of the characters in `row`, we need to adjust the state to reflect that. Specifically, since `row` has at least one more character, we need to ensure that the current index of `i` is less than the length of `row` minus 1 (to ensure there is still a character to process).

Thus, we can conclude that if `i` is currently at the last character of `row`, then for the loop to execute again, we need to modify the state to reflect that `row` has at least one more character available and `i` must be updated to reflect the next character in `row`.

State: **`nRow` includes the updated value based on the evaluation of `i`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character available, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
