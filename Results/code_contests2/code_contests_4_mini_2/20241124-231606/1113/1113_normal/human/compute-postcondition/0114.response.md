According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one character. Given that `row` is described as a non-empty string, the loop can execute as it stands. 

However, we also need to consider the state of `i`, which will take on the values of each character in `row` during the iterations. At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to the first character in `row`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `nRow` remains an empty string (not relevant for the loop), `res` still contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is now the first character of `row`.

State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`**
