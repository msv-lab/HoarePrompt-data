The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means `row` will contain a string input from the user, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. The other variables remain unaffected as they are not altered by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.
