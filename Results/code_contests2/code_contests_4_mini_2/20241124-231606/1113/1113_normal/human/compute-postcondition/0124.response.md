According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. The variable `i` will take on each character of `row` in sequence.

At the end of the last iteration, we know `nRow` has been updated based on the value of `i`. The conditions specify that if `i` is '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1'; otherwise, `nRow` is concatenated with the character `i`. Given that `row` is a non-empty string, `i` must take on each character of `row` during the iterations.

Since `row` is non-empty, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more characters in `row` to iterate over. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should now be the next character in `row`. 

To determine the necessary state adjustments:
- Since `row` is non-empty, we need to ensure that there is at least one more character left in `row` after the current iteration. 
- If the current character `i` is the last character in `row`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `row` has at least one more character remaining.

Assuming `row` has more characters than have been processed, we can set `i` to the next character in `row`. Thus, we need to say that `row` has at least one more character, and `i` is updated to the next character.

State: **`nRow` is updated, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` has at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`**
