The value of `nRow` is concatenated with `i`, and since `nRow` is a string and `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` will now contain its previous value plus the character `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is a string, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`**
