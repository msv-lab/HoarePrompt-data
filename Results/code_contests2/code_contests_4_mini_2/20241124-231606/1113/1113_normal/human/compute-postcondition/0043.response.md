The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` to it. Since `nRow` is a string that results from concatenating `res` with either '1' or the character `i` from `row`, the previous value of `nRow` remains unchanged except for the addition of `i`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is a string that results from concatenating `res` and either '1' or the character `i`, and `nRow` is updated by adding the character `i`.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string that results from concatenating `res` and either '1' or the character `i`, and `nRow` is updated by adding the character `i`**
