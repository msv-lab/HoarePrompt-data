The loop processes each character in the string `row`, replacing '9' with '1' and leaving other characters unchanged, appending the results to `nRow`. The loop will execute once for each character in `row`. 

If `row` is empty, the loop will not execute at all, and `nRow` will remain an empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is the string formed by converting every '9' in `row` to '1' and leaving other characters unchanged; if `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string.**
