The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating it with the value of `i`. Since `nRow` is a string that initially contains the character `i`, after the operation, `nRow` will contain two occurrences of `i`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains two occurrences of `i`, `res` contains 9 strings with '9' replaced by '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after the current `i`, and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` contains two occurrences of `i`, `res` contains 9 strings with '9' replaced by '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after the current `i`, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
