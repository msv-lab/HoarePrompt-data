The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value. The initial state indicates that `nRow` is updated to `nRow + '1'`, but the specific previous value of `nRow` is not provided. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` contains 18 strings with every '9' replaced by '1', `i` is the third element of `row`, `nRow` is updated to `nRow + '1'`, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, and `row` contains at least 3 elements**
