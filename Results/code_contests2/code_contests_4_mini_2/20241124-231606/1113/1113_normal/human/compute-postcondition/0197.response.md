Output State: **`res` contains `T * 9` strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', and all other characters remain unchanged. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute and `res` remains an empty list. If fewer than `T * 9` lines of input are provided, an error will occur when attempting to read inputs beyond the available lines. If any input `row` is empty during the loop execution, `nRow` will be an empty string, which is appended to `res`.**
