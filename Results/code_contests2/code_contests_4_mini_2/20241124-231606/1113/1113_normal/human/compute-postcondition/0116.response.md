The value of `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, and the first character of `row` is '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, and the first character of `row` is '9'**
