The variable `nRow` is assigned the value `nRow + i`. However, the previous value of `nRow` is unknown, and the value of `i` is the third character of `row`, which has at least 3 characters. Therefore, the updated value of `nRow` is dependent on the unknown value of `nRow` and the specific character `i`. 

The output state is: `t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to its previous value.
