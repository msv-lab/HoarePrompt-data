According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character processed from `row`. Given that `row` is a non-empty string containing at least one more character, it means there are still characters left in `row` to iterate over. 

Since `i` has already taken on the last character of `row`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to take on the next character in `row`, which would be the next character after the last one processed. Hence, the length of `row` must be at least one more than the previous length during the last iteration. 

The adjustment needed is:
- The variable `i` should be set to the next character in `row`, which means the total characters in `row` must increase by one, leading to the conclusion that `row` now contains one more character.

State: **`nRow` is a string that results from concatenating `res` with either '1' if `i` is '9', or with the character `i` from `row`, `row` is a string containing at least one more character.**
