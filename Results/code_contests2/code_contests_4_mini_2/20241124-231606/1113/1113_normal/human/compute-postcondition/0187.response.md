According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. If `row` has at least one more character after the current character `i`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and `i` is the next character in `row`. Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be the next character in `row`, and since `row` has at least one more character, `row` must have at least one additional character beyond the current `i`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now the next character in `row`, and we must ensure `row` still has at least one more character after `i`.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated to include '1' if `i` is '9', or concatenated with `i` otherwise, and `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`.**
