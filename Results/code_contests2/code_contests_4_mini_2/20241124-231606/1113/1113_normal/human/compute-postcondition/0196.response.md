According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is greater than 18, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains 18 strings, indicating that the loop has executed 18 times. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be at least 19.

State: **`res` contains 18 strings where each string has '9' replaced by '1' and other characters unchanged, T is at least 19**
