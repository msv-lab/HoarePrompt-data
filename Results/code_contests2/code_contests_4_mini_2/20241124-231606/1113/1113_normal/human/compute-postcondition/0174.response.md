According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `i` has not been provided, but it is implied that it will increment with each iteration. Since `res` includes `nRow`, it seems that the loop has successfully executed at least once already.

To determine the necessary adjustments, we note that for the next iteration, `i` must be incremented. Therefore, `i` will be increased by 1. If `i` was 8 at the end of the last iteration, it would allow for one more execution of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to 8, since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to 8 in the range.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the modified string with '9' replaced by '1', `res` now includes `nRow`, `i` is 8**
