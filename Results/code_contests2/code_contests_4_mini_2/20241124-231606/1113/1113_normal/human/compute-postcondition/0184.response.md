`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. The value of `nRow` remains unchanged prior to this operation, and since it is being concatenated with '1', the new value of `nRow` will be the previous value of `nRow` plus '1'. The other variables (`row`, `i`, and `res`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1', `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1', `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`**.
