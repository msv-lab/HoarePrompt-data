According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must be a non-empty string because the for loop iterates over each character in the string. The variable `i`, which is initially set to 9, will be overwritten by the for loop to represent each character of `row` during its iterations.

Since `nRow` is an empty string, it does not affect the execution of the loop directly, but `res` is dependent on `nRow`. However, for the loop to execute, the crucial condition is that `row` must not be an empty string. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `row` contains at least one character. The variable `i` will be set to the first character in `row` during the first iteration. 

State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the previous value of `nRow` appended to it, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string**
