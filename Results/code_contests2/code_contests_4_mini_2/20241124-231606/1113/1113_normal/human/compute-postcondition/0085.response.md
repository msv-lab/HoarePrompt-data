The value of `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it is affected by this operation. The other variables (`res`, `T`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` has been updated, but the exact previous value is unknown.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated with '1' appended**.
