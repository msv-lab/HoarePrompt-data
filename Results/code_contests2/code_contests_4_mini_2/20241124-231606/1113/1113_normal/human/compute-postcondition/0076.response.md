The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the current value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will contain the string '1'. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1'**
