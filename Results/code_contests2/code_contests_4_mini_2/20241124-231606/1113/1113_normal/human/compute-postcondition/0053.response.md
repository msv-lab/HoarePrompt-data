`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, the new value of `nRow` will be '1'. The value of `res` is updated to include this new value of `nRow`, but since we don't have the prior value of `res`, we cannot determine its exact new value. The other variables `i` and `row` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '1', `res` includes the updated `nRow`, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` includes the updated `nRow`, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string**
