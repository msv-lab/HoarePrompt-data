`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, where `nRow` is a string and '1' is appended to it. The previous value of `nRow` is `res`. The state of `res`, `row`, and `i` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `nRow` as a string with '1' appended.

Output State: **`nRow` is `res + '1'`, `res` is the previous value of `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`**
