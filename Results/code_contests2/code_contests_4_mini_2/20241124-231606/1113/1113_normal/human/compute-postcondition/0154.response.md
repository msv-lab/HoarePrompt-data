According to the code, the loop executes a fixed number of times, specifically 9 times, as indicated by `range(9)`. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 8, after which the loop terminates.

At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is 8 (the last value in the range), the loop will not execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be less than 9. Since `i` is currently at its maximum value of 8, it must be adjusted to 9 to indicate that the loop has completed its iterations.

No other state variables need adjustment since `nRow` and `res` are not relevant to the loop iteration count itself.

State: **`nRow` is the string formed by converting every '9' in `row` to '1' and leaving other characters unchanged; if `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string, and `res` is appended to `res`; `i` is 9**
