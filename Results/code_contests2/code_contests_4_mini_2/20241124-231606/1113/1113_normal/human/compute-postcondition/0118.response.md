The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself plus `i`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, the result will depend on the value of `i`. However, the value of `i` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` is concatenated with `i`, but we cannot specify the resulting value of `nRow` without knowing `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, the first character of `row` is not '9', and `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i`**
