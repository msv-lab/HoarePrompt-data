According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the string `row`. If `row` has at least one more character after the current `i`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a string resulting from concatenating `res` with '1' if `i` is '9', or with the character `i` from `row` otherwise. Since `row` is stated to contain at least one more character, we can conclude that there is a next character for `i` to take.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next character in `row`. If `i` is currently the last character in `row`, the loop will not execute again. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted to the next character in the string `row`. If the current `i` is not the last character, we can simply state that `i` will take the next character in the sequence.

State: **`nRow` is a string that results from concatenating `res` with the next character in `row`, where `row` is a string containing at least one more character, and `i` is the next character in `row`**.
