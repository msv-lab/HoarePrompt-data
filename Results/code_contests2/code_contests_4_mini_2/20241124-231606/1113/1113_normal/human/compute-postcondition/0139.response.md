The code appends '1' to `nRow`, which initially is the string formed by replacing '9' with '1' in the first element of `row`. Therefore, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` starts as '1'. After executing the line, `nRow` will become '11'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`res` contains 18 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` contains at least 1 element, `i` is '9', `nRow` is '11'**
