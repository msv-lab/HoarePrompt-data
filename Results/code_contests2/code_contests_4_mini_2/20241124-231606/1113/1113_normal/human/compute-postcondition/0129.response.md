Output State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the same characters as `row` but with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1'. If `row` is empty, then the loop does not execute and `nRow` remains an empty string. `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `row` has no '9's, `nRow` will be identical to `row`. If all characters in `row` are '9's, `nRow` will consist solely of '1's, with its length equal to the length of `row`.**
