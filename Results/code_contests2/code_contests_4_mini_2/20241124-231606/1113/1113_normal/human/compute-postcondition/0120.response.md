According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. The variable `i` will take on the value of each character in `row` during the iterations. To determine if the loop will execute one more time, we need to consider the length of `row`. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `row` is a non-empty string, we can conclude that it has at least one character. The loop is executed for each character in `row`, and since `i` will take on the value of each character in `row`, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the next value of `i` will correspond to the next character in `row`.

If `row` has `m` characters, and the last character was processed in the previous iteration, then the next character to be processed must be the `m`-th character in `row`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `row` must be greater than the number of iterations already executed, which is 1 less than the total number of characters in `row`.

Since we are not given the specific length of `row`, we can only confirm that it needs to be adjusted so that the loop can continue iterating. Thus, we need to ensure that the state reflects that `i` will be set to the next character in `row`.

State: **`nRow` is a string, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`**.
