Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string. If `i` is '9', `nRow` becomes '1', while `res` remains unchanged. If `i` is any character other than '9', `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it, and `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`. In either case, `row` remains a non-empty string.***
