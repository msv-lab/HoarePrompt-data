The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the character '1' to its current value, which is a string containing the character `i`. Since `nRow` is currently a string, after the operation, it will contain the original string followed by '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` now contains the original string with '1' appended, `res` contains 9 strings with '9' replaced by '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after the current `i`, and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` now contains the original string followed by '1'; `res` contains 9 strings with '9' replaced by '1'; `T` is greater than 9; `t` is 9; `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after the current `i`; `i` is the next character in `row`**.
