The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the value of `i`, which is the second character of `row`. The initial state indicates that `row` is a non-empty string, so `i` has a specific character value. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to its previous value.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to its previous value**
