The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables (`res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`), which retain their previous states. Therefore, the output state is that `nRow` is now an empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '', `res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is 9, `row` is an input string without leading or trailing whitespace**.
