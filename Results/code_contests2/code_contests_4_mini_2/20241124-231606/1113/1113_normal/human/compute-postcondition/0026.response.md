Output State: **`nRow` is formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', and all other characters in `row` are added to `nRow` unchanged. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop executes for each character in `row`, resulting in `nRow` containing the modified string. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string.**
