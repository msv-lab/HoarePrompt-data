The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the current value of `i` to it. Since `i` is 0, `nRow` becomes the string representation of 0. The initial state indicates that `nRow` is an empty string, so after the operation, `nRow` will be '0'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '0', `res` includes the updated `nRow`, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is '0', `res` includes the updated `nRow`, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9'**.
