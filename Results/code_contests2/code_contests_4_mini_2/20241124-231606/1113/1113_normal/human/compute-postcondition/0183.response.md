According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the `row` string. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in `row` after the last character that was processed in the previous iteration.

Since `row` is a non-empty string and is being iterated through with `i` representing the current character, we need to determine what the state of `i` would be at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` would have held the last character of `row`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be updated to the next character in the string. This means that if the length of `row` is `len(row)`, then `i` should be `row[len(row)]`, which is out of bounds, indicating no more characters are left.

Furthermore, since the loop processes characters, `row` must have at least one more character beyond the current `i`. Thus, we need to ensure that the state reflects that `row` has additional characters available.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` remains unchanged, `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`**
