The `res.append(nRow)` statement adds the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The initial state indicates that `nRow` is derived from a string `row` by replacing every '9' with '1', while retaining all other characters. If `row` is empty, `nRow` would also be empty, and thus, nothing would be appended to `res`. If `row` contains '9', those will be converted to '1' in `nRow`, and `res` will append this modified string. If `row` does not contain '9', `nRow` will simply be a copy of `row`.

Assuming `res` retains its previous value and `nRow` is either empty or modified as described, the output state will reflect the updated state of `res` after appending `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, which is a string with '9' replaced by '1' or empty if `row` is empty**.
