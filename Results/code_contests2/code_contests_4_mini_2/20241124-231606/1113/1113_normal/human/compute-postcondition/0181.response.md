`nRow` is updated by concatenating the current value of `i` to it. Since the initial state mentions that `nRow` is '', it will now have the value of `i` appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now equal to the value of `i`, `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now equal to the value of `i`, `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
