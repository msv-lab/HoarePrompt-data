According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string based on user input, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` is already set to 8, but within the loop, it will be reassigned to the characters in `row` sequentially.

For the loop to execute properly, we need to ensure that `i` is set to the first character of `row` at the start of the loop. Since `row` is non-empty, we can specify that `i` will be the first character in `row`.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '', `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is the first character of `row`**
