Output State: **`res` contains 18 strings where each string has '9' replaced by '1' and other characters unchanged. If any input `row` is empty during the loop execution, then `nRow` is an empty string, which is appended to `res`. If the loop does not execute (for example, if the range is modified or set to 0), `res` remains unchanged and contains the initial 18 strings.**
