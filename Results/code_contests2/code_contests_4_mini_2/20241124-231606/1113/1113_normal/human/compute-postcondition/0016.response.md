Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to the value of `i`, which is not '9'.***
