The provided code snippet registers a lambda function with the `atexit` module, which ensures that the lambda function will be called when the program is about to terminate. This function writes the contents of `sys.stdout`, which has been redirected to an `io.BytesIO` object, to the standard output stream (file descriptor 1).

The registration of this function does not alter the values of the existing variables in the program, such as `t`, nor does it change the state of the 9x9 grid. The output state remains the same, but it indicates that there is now a cleanup function registered to run at the end of the program execution. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and the cleanup function to write stdout is registered.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and the cleanup function to write stdout is registered.**
