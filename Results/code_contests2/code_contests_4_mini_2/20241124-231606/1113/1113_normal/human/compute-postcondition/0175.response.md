The value of `row` is assigned the result of `input().strip()`, which means it will now hold a new value based on user input after removing any leading and trailing whitespace. The other variables (`nRow`, `res`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `row` based on the user input.

Output State: **`row` is a new non-empty string based on user input, `nRow` is the modified string with '9' replaced by '1', `res` now includes `nRow`, `i` is 8**
