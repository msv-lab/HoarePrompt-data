The string `nRow` is being updated by appending the character '1' to its previous value. The previous value of `nRow` is not explicitly provided, but it is affected by the value of `i`, which is the third character of `row`. The other variables are not impacted by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` has been updated.

Output State: **`row` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, `nRow` is updated by appending '1'**
