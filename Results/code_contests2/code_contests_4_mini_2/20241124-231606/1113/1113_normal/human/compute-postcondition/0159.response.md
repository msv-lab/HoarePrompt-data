The code appends '1' to `nRow`, which is currently an empty string. Therefore, after the execution, `nRow` will contain the string '1'. The variable `row` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation, and the first character of `row` (i) is still '9'. 

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', and the first character of `row` (i) is '9'**.
