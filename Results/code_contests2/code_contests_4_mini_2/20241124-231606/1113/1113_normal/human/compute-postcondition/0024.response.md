Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, and `i` is the third character of `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to include '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to its previous value, ensuring that `nRow` reflects either the inclusion of '1' or the character `i` based on the value of `i`.***
