Output State: **`nRow` is a string that results from replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', while retaining all other characters. `res` holds the previous value of `nRow` after each iteration. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, `nRow` remains an empty string, `res` remains unchanged, and `i` is not defined within the loop's context. If `row` contains only '9's, `nRow` will be a string of '1's of the same length as `row` after the loop completes.**
