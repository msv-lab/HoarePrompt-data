According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. The loop will execute for each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third character of `row`, and the loop is iterating over the characters in `row`.

Since `row` has at least 3 characters and `i` is the third character, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the fourth character of `row`. Therefore, the string `row` must have at least 4 characters.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, but it does not affect the continuation of the loop.

State: **`row` is a string with at least 4 characters, `i` is the fourth character of `row`, `nRow` is updated accordingly**
