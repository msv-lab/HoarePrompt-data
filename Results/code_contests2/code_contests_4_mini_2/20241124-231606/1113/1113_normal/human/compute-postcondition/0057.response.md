To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop and the provided state.

1. The for loop iterates over `row`, which is a non-empty string. This means `row` contains at least one character.
2. The variable `i` takes on the value of each character in `row` during each iteration.
3. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to include '1'; if `i` is any other value, `nRow` is updated to include the value of `i`.
4. Since `row` is non-empty, there are still characters left in `row` for the loop to execute again unless we are at the last character.

To adjust the states:
- To allow the loop to execute one more time, `row` must still contain at least one more character after the last iteration.
- If `i` corresponds to the last character of `row`, the next iteration would have to correspond to the next character, which will depend on the length of `row`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure:
- The next value of `i` should correspond to a character in `row`, meaning `row` must still have characters left.

Assuming `i` was the last character during the previous iteration, we need to adjust `row` to have at least one more character.

State: **`nRow` includes the updated value based on the evaluation of `i`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character available.**
