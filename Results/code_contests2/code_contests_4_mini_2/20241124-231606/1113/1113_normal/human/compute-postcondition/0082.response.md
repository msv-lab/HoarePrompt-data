The code `nRow += i` updates the value of `nRow` by adding the current value of `i` to it. The initial state indicates that `i` is the next character in `row`, which suggests that `i` is a string character. Additionally, `nRow` is updated accordingly, but the exact previous value of `nRow` is not specified.

Since `i` is being added to `nRow`, the output state reflects the change in `nRow` with the unknown previous value. Therefore, the output state will mention the change without needing the exact previous value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is a string with at least one character remaining, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to it.**
