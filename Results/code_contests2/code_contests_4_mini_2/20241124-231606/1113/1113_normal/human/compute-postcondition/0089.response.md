Output State: **`nRow` contains the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop executes for each character in `row`. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute and `nRow` remains an empty string. `res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, and `t` is 9.**
