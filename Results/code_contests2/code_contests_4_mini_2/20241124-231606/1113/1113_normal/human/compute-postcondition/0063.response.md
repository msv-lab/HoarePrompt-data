The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i` to its current value. Since `row` is a non-empty string and `i` is the next character in `row`, `i` has a specific value. The previous value of `nRow` is maintained, and only its content changes with the addition of `i`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` includes the updated value with `i` appended, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character available, and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` includes the updated value with `i` appended, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character available, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
