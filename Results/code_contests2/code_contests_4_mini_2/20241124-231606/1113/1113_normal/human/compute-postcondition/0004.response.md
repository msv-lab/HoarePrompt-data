The code assigns `maxint` the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. This does not affect the values of `t` or `write`, as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the values of `t`, `write`, and the new assignment of `maxint`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is float('inf')**
