Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string that contains the character `i`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to include '1' at the end (resulting in `nRow` being `i1`). If `i` is any other character, `nRow` is updated to include `i` at the end (resulting in `nRow` containing two `i` characters). In both cases, `res` contains 9 strings with '9' replaced by '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after the current `i`.***
