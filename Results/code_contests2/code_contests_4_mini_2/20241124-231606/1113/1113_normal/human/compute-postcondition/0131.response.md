According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, we do not have the value of `i`, but we know that it must be less than 9 for the loop to continue. Since `res` contains 11 strings, it does not affect the loop's execution condition.

To determine the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increase the value of `i` by 1. Therefore, if `i` was previously 8, it will now be 9, which would stop the loop from executing again. So we need to state that `i` is 8 to allow for one more iteration.

State: **`nRow` is a string derived from `row`, `res` contains 11 strings, `i` is 8**
