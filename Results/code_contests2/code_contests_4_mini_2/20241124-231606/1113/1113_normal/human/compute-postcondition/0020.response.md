Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, and `i` is the second character of `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to `nRow` + '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to `nRow` + `i`, where `i` can be any character from `row` except '9', ensuring that `nRow` reflects the addition of the appropriate character based on the value of `i`.
