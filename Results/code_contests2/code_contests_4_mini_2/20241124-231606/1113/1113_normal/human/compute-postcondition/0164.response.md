The variable `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its current value. The initial state indicates that `nRow` has a value based on the second character of `row`, but the specific value of `nRow` is not provided. Therefore, after the execution, `nRow` will be whatever its previous value was, with '1' added to it. The other variables `row` and `i` are not affected. 

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value**.
