According to the code, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the number 9. The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 8 (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 9.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration does not mention the value of `i`, we can infer that `i` should have reached its maximum value of 8 at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be reset to 9, which is the end of the range and will not allow for another iteration.

Thus, there are no other states that need to be adjusted since `nRow` and `res` do not influence the loop's execution, and it's only dependent on the loop counter `i`.

State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is 9**
