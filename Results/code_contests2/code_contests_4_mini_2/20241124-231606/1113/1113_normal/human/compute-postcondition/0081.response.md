The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to its current value. The other variables (`res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is a string with at least one character remaining, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1'.**
