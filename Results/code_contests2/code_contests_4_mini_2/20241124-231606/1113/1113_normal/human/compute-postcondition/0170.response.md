Postcondition: ***`row` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' if `i` is '9'; otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i`. Thus, if `i` is '9', `nRow` will contain '1' at the end, while for any other character in `i`, that character will be appended to `nRow`.***
