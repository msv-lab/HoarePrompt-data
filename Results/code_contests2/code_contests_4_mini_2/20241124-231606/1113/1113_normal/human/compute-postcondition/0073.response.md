The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The initial values of other variables are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', all other characters remain unchanged; `T` is greater than 9; `t` is 9; `i` is 0; `row` is an input string; `nRow` is an empty string.
