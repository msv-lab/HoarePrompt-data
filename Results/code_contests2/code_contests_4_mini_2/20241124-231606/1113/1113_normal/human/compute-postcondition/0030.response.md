The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous values of `nRow`, `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged, but `nRow` now holds the value of an empty string. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the previous value of `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string.

Output State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the previous value of `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string**.
