The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The exact previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it is updated based on the evaluation of `i`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, it remains unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` has increased by `i`.

Output State: **`nRow` has increased by `i`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character available**
