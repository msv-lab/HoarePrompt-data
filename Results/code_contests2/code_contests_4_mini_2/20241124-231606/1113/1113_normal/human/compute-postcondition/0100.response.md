According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more characters in the `row` string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` represents the current character in the `row` string. 

Given that `nRow` is a string either containing '1' if `i` is '9' or the character `i` if `i` is not '9', and since `t` is currently 9, it indicates that the loop has been iterating over the characters in `row`. 

The state of `row` at the end of the previous iteration is significant; if `row` is not empty and the loop is still executing, it must have had at least one character left for `i` to take on a value in the last iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that the index for the next iteration (`i`) moves to the next character in `row`.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` should take on the next character in `row`. Thus, the state should reflect that `i` is now the next character in `row`, and `row` should still be non-empty.

Assuming `row` has additional characters after the current `i`, we need to ensure that `row` contains at least one more character after the last character that was processed. 

State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the character `i`, `res` contains 9 strings with '9' replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after current `i`**
