Output State: **`nRow` is a string where all occurrences of '9' in `row` are replaced with '1', while other characters remain unchanged. `res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1'. `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string.**
