The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. Initially, `nRow` is an empty string, so after the execution, `nRow` will contain the value of `i`. The previous value of `res` is not affected, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is the value of `i`, `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is not equal to '9', and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is the value of `i`, `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is not equal to '9', and `row` is a non-empty string**
