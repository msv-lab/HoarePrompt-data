The code appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The value of `nRow` depends on the string `row`. Since `row` is non-empty, `nRow` will either be identical to `row` (if there are no '9's) or will have all '9's replaced by '1's. As a result, `res` will be modified by adding `nRow` to it. The previous state of `res` is that it contains 10 strings. Therefore, after execution, `res` will contain 11 strings, with `nRow` added.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string derived from `row`, `res` contains 11 strings now**
