Functionality: ** The function reads an integer T from input, indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes 9 lines of input. It replaces every occurrence of '9' in the input lines with '1', while all other characters remain unchanged. The resulting modified lines are collected and printed. If T is 0, no lines are processed, and an empty output is produced. If there are fewer than T * 9 lines of input, an error will occur when the function attempts to read beyond the available lines. Additionally, if any input line is empty during processing, an empty string will be appended to the results. The function does not return any value explicitly.**
