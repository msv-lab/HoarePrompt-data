According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. If `row` has at least one more character after the current `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after the current `i`. Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, `i` needs to be updated to the next character in `row`.

Since `row` contains at least one more character after the current `i`, `i` will take the next character in the sequence. The specific value of `i` after the next iteration will depend on the actual content of `row` and what comes after the current `i`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `row` remains unchanged, and `i` needs to be the next character in `row`, which we cannot determine without more specific context.

Given that, the adjusted state should reflect that `i` has moved to the next character in `row`, keeping `nRow`, `res`, and `T` unchanged.

State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the character `i`, `res` contains 9 strings with '9' replaced by '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after the current `i`, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
