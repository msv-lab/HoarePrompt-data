The code appends the character '1' to the existing string `nRow`. The previous state indicates that `nRow` is a string resulting from concatenation, but the exact value of `nRow` is not specified. The variable `nRow` will now include '1' at the end of its current value. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string concatenated with '1', `row` is a string containing at least one more character**
