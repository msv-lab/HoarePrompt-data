The value of `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous value of `nRow` was a string formed by converting every '9' in `row` to '1', but that is now overwritten. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string, and `i` is 9.

Output State: **`row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is '', `i` is 9**
