The code `nRow += '1'` appends the character '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will contain the string '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is now '1'.
