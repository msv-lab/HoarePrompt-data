Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 strings where every '9' in the input lines is replaced with '1', `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, and `i` is the next character in `row`. After executing the if-else block, `nRow` is updated by appending '1' if `i` is '9', or by appending the character `i` if it is not '9', ensuring `nRow` reflects the appropriate transformation of the character based on its value.***
