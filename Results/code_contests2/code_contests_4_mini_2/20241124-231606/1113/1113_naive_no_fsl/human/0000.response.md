Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to transform a valid Sudoku solution into an anti-sudoku. 

The key requirements for an anti-sudoku are:
1. Each row must contain at least two equal elements.
2. Each column must contain at least two equal elements.
3. Each 3x3 block must contain at least two equal elements.

The provided program only checks for the character '9' and changes it to '1', while leaving all other digits unchanged. This approach fails to ensure that the resulting grid meets the criteria of having at least two equal elements in each row, column, and 3x3 block.

For example, consider the following Sudoku input:

```
123456789
987654321
123456789
987654321
123456789
987654321
123456789
987654321
123456789
```

This input is a valid Sudoku solution. The program will convert all '9's to '1's:

```
123456781
987654321
123456781
987654321
123456781
987654321
123456781
987654321
123456781
```

In this output:
- Row 1 has no duplicates.
- Row 2 has no duplicates.
- All rows, columns, and blocks fail to meet the anti-sudoku requirements.

Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description.
