According to the code, the loop will execute a total of 9 times, with `i` taking values from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` would be equal to 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9. Since the loop condition is based on `i` being less than 9, we need to adjust `i` to be 9. Other states such as `nRow` and `res` do not need any adjustments as they are not dependent on the loop execution condition.

State: **`nRow` is a string with '9's replaced by '1's, `res` has `nRow` appended, `i` is 9**
