Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is any character, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one additional character. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to the original value concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to the original value concatenated with the character `i`.***
