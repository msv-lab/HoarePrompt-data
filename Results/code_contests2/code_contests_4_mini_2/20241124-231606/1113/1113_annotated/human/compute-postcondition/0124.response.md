To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. The variable `i` takes each character in `row` during successive iterations.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a string derived from its original value. The updated value of `nRow` depends on the character `i` from the last iteration:
   - If `i` was '9', then `nRow` is the original string concatenated with '1'.
   - If `i` was any character other than '9', then `nRow` is the original string concatenated with the next character in the string `row`.

3. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute again, `row` must have more characters left for `i` to take on a value. If the last character processed was the last character of `row`, the loop cannot execute again.

4. **Adjusting States**: 
   - We need to know the current character `i` processed from `row` and the length of `row`. If we assume that `i` was the last character in `row`, then there are no characters left for the next iteration. 
   - If `i` was not the last character, then we need to adjust `nRow` accordingly.

Since we have not been given the specific values of `row` or the last character processed, we cannot definitively state what the new value of `nRow` should be without knowing the context of `row`. However, we can state that for the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that `row` has more characters.

Assuming that `i` was the last character of `row`, we need to adjust `row` to have more characters. This means we cannot proceed to the next iteration.

Given this analysis, I will maintain the information about `nRow` but we need to ensure that `row` has more characters.

State: **`nRow` is the original string derived from its last value, `row` has at least one more character remaining**
