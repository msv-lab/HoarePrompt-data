The code updates the variable `nRow` by adding the value of `i` to it. The initial state indicates that `row` is a non-empty iterable and `i` is the next element in `row`, which means `i` has a specific value from that iterable. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`, while the specific values of `nRow` and `i` are noted generically.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i`.**
