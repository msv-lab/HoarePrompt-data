Output State: **`nRow` is the string formed by replacing each occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', while all other characters remain unchanged. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string. If `row` contains characters other than '9', these characters are preserved in their original order in `nRow`.**
