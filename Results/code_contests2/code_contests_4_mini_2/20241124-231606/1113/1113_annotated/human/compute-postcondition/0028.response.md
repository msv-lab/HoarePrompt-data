According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has reached its maximum value of 8, which means it is less than 9. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 9.

Since `nRow` is a derived string from `row` and does not affect the loop execution directly, it remains unchanged.

State: **`nRow` is the string formed by replacing each occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', while all other characters remain unchanged; i is 9**
