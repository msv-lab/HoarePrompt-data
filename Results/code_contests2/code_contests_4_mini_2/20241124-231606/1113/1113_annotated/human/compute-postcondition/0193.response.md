The code appends `nRow` to the list `res`. The value of `nRow` is already defined as a string where every occurrence of '9' in `row` is replaced with '1', and other characters in `row` are preserved in their original order. The variable `res` remains unchanged prior to this operation. If `row` is an empty string, `nRow` will also be an empty string, and thus `res` will have an empty string appended to it. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the contents of `res` after appending `nRow`.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string with '9's replaced by '1's; `res` has `nRow` appended**.
