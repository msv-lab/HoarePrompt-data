According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has not been provided, but since the loop runs for `i` in the range of 9, we can infer that `i` must be 8 for this to be the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9, which would reach the termination condition of the loop.

Since `nRow` is a string that contains the modified version of `row`, and `res` contains 11 modified strings, those states do not need adjustment based on the loop execution. The only adjustment needed is for `i` to reflect the next iteration.

State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the modified version of `row`, `res` contains 11 modified strings, `i` is 9**
