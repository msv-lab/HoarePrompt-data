The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will contain the value '1'. The values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` has its previous value, `i` is '9', and `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`res` has its previous value, `i` is '9', and `nRow` is '1'**
