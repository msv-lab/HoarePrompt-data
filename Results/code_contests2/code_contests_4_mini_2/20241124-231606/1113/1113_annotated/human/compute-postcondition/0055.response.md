The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, the new value of `nRow` will be equal to the current value of `i`. The value of `i` is not specified, but we know it is not equal to '9', and `res` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` has its previous value, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`res` has its previous value, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now equal to `i`**
