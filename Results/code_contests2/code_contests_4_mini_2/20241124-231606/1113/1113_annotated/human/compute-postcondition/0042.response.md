`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. The previous value of `nRow` includes the original characters plus the next character in `row`, and `i` is the next character in `row`, which does not affect the operation. Therefore, the output state is that `nRow` now includes the original characters plus the next character in `row` plus '1', and `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` includes the original characters plus the next character in `row` plus '1', `i` is the next character in `row`**
