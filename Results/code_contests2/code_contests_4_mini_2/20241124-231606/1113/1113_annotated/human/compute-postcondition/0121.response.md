`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, which means that the string '1' is concatenated to the end of the current value of `nRow`. The values of `i` and `row` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is the original string plus '1', `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is the original string plus '1', `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string**
