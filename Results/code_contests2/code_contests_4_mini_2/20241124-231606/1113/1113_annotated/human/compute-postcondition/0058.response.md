The code appends the character '1' to the string `nRow`. The previous values of `nRow` are not given, but we know that `nRow` is modified by this operation. Other variables (`res`, `row`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nRow` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is modified to include '1'**
