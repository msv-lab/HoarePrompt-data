The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. Given that `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will contain the string '1'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '1'.
