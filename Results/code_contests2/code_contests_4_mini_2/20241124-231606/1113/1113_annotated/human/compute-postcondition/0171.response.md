According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop will execute again as long as there are more elements in `row` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next element in `row`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next element in `row`, and `row` must still contain more elements.

Since `i` is currently the next element in `row`, we can conclude that `row` still has elements left to iterate. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be the next element in `row`.

State: **`row` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` remains unchanged**
