The code `nRow += '1'` appends the character '1' to the end of the string `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but since it is a string that gets updated by adding '1', it will now contain its previous value followed by the character '1'. The states of the other variables (`res`, `row`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to its previous value plus '1'.

Output State: **`res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to its previous value plus '1'**
