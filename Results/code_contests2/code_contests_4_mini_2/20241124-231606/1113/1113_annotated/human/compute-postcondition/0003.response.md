The code assigns the function `sys.stdout.write` to the variable `write`. This means that `write` can now be used to output data to standard output. The variable `t` is not affected by this assignment, and its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`**
