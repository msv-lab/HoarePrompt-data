The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to its current value. Since `nRow` is derived from its last value, it will now contain that value followed by '1'. The variable `row` remains unaffected in this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `nRow` without altering `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is the original string derived from its last value followed by '1', `row` has at least one more character remaining**
