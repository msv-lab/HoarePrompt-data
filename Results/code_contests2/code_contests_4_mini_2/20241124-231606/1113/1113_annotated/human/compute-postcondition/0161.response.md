The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the value of `i` (which is the first element in `row` and not equal to '9') to it. The previous value of `nRow` is an empty string, so after this operation, `nRow` will be equal to the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty iterable, `nRow` is equal to the first element of `row`, `res` remains unchanged, and `i` is the first element in `row` and not equal to '9'**
