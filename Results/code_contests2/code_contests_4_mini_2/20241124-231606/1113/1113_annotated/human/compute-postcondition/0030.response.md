The code `nRow = ''` assigns an empty string to `nRow`. This means that the previous value of `nRow` (which was a string formed by replacing '9' with '1' in `row`) is overwritten and lost. The values of `i` and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string with whitespace removed.

Output State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string with whitespace removed**.
