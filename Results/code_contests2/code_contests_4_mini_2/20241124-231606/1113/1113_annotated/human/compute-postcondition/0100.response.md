To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided information about variable states and the loop structure:

1. The loop iterates over `row`. Therefore, for the loop to continue executing, `row` must still contain characters or digits for `i` to take on a value.

2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to '9', which means `nRow` has been updated to '1' (as per the given condition). 

3. Now, since `row` is a non-empty string throughout the execution and we know `i` was '9', we need to consider the next character in `row` that the loop will process during the next iteration.

4. Since `i` is currently '9', we need to assume that the next character in `row` will be the next element after '9'. If `row` has more characters after '9', `i` will take on the next character.

5. If `row` contains only '9', then the loop will not execute again. Therefore, we conclude that `row` must contain additional characters after '9' for the loop to execute one more time.

Based on these observations, we need to adjust the state as follows:

State: **`nRow` is '1', `i` is the next character in `row` after '9', `row` contains more characters after '9'**
