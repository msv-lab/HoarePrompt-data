`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. The variable `res` remains unchanged, and the variable `i` retains the value of the next character in `row`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow` while other variables remain as they were. 

Output State: **`nRow` is the original string plus '1', `res` remains unchanged, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string**
