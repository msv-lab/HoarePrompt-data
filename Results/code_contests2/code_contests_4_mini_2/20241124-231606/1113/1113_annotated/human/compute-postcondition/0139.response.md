The `nRow` variable is modified by appending the string '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will hold the value '1'. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 18 modified strings, `T` is at least 10, `t` is 9, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`res` contains 18 modified strings, `T` is at least 10, `t` is 9, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1'**
