According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` iterable. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty iterable, and `i` is the current element of `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element in `row` that hasn't been iterated over yet. This means that the next value of `i` must be the next element in `row`.

Since `row` is non-empty, we do not need to change its state itself, but we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the next element in `row`. However, since we do not have information about the specific elements in `row`, we cannot make assumptions about the next element.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to indicate that `i` will take on the next value in `row`.

State: **`row` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the next element in `row`**
