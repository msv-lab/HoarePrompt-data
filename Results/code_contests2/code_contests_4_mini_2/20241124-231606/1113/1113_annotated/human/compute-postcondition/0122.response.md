The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the next character `i` from `row` to it. Since `nRow` is originally a string and `i` is a character, the new value of `nRow` will be the original string plus the character. The variables `i` and `row` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`nRow` is the original string plus the character `i`, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string**
