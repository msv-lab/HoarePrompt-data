To determine the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the current state and the loop structure.

1. **Current State Analysis**: 
   - `nRow` is a string that starts with '1'. 
   - If `i` is '9', then `nRow` becomes '11'.
   - If `i` is any other character, `nRow` becomes '1' followed by that character.

2. **Loop Structure**: 
   - The loop iterates over each character in `row`. 
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in `row`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**: 
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` has a value that was the last character processed in the previous iteration.
   - To determine if the loop can run again, we need to consider the next character in `row` after the current `i`.
   - If `i` is '9', the next character must be the one following '9' in `row`. 
   - If `i` is any other character, the loop will execute one more time with the next character in `row`.

Assuming that `row` has at least one more character after the current `i`, we need to set `i` to the next character in `row`.

State: **`nRow` starts with '1', `i` is the next character in `row`, where `row` has at least one more character after the current `i`**
