The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input string from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `res`, `T`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables while noting the new variable `row` as an input string.

Output State: **`res` contains 18 modified strings, `T` is at least 10, `t` is 9, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string**.
