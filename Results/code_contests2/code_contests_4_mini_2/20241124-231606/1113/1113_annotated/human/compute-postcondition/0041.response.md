According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. The loop will continue executing as long as there are more characters left to iterate over in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` represents the current character of `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have additional characters, and `i` should be updated to the next character in `row`. Since `nRow` is constructed based on the value of `i`, we must also account for what the next character will be in the context of how `nRow` is defined.

Assuming that `nRow` has been updated based on the last character of `row`, if `i` is currently the last character, the next character to be processed (in the next iteration) will not exist, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, to allow for another iteration, `row` must have at least one more character beyond the current index of `i`.

If `i` is currently '9', then `nRow` has '1' appended; otherwise, `nRow` simply includes the next character in `row`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `row` must have more characters, meaning that the character `i` must be updated to the next character in `row`. 

So the adjusted state should reflect that `i` is now the next character in `row` and that `nRow` is updated accordingly.

State: **`nRow` includes the original characters plus the next character in `row`, `i` is the next character in `row`**
