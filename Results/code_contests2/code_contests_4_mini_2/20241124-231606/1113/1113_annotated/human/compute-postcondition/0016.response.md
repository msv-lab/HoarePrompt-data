Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, if `i` is any other character, `nRow` is updated to the string representation of `i`. In the case that `i` is not '9', `nRow` will not be equal to '1'.***
