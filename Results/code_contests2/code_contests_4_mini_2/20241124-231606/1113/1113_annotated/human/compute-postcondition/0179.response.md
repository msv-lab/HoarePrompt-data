The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after this operation, `nRow` will become `'1'`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '1', `res` is unchanged, `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` is unchanged, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string**
