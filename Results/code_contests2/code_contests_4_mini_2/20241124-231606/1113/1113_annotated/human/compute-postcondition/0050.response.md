The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The variable `res` retains its previous value, which has `nRow` appended to it, but since `nRow` is now an empty string, the effect on `res` is that it remains the same as before. The other variables, `i` and `row`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is that `res` still has its previous value, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string after stripping.

Output State: **`res` has its previous value, `i` is 9, `row` is an input string after stripping, and `nRow` is an empty string**.
