The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string, and `nRow` is an empty string**
