The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1', so after execution, `nRow` will be '11'. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` starts with '1', `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` starts with '1', `nRow` is '11', `i` is the next character in `row`**
