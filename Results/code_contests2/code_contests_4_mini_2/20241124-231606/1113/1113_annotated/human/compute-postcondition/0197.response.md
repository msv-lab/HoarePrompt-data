Output State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings where each occurrence of '9' in the corresponding input `row` is replaced with '1'; if a `row` input is empty, `nRow` is an empty string and is appended to `res`. The loop executes exactly 9 times regardless of input; if fewer than 9 inputs are provided during execution, it will lead to potential errors or exceptions due to missing input. If `T` is 0 or the input prompt is not provided, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty list.**
