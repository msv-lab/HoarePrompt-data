Output State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the modified version of `row` where every occurrence of '9' is replaced by '1', and all other characters remain unchanged. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute and `nRow` remains an empty string. `res` contains 10 modified strings, and `row` is a non-empty string throughout the execution, ensuring that the loop processes each character of `row`.**
