The code `nRow += '1'` appends the character '1' to the current value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is modified to include '1' if `i` is '9', or to append `i` otherwise, we need to consider the previous value of `nRow` before executing this line. The value of `nRow` is not explicitly stated in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a string. Therefore, the new value of `nRow` will be its previous value concatenated with '1'.

The output state reflects that `nRow` has been modified, but we do not know its exact previous state. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `nRow` has been updated.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` has been updated to include '1'.**
