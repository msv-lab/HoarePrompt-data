The line of code `nRow = ''` assigns an empty string to `nRow`. The previous conditions mention that if `row` is non-empty, `nRow` would be formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1'. However, since `nRow` is now set to an empty string, it indicates that the operation to replace '9's did not take place.

Given the previous state, if `row` was non-empty, `nRow` would have been formed but is now overridden to be empty. If `row` were empty, `nRow` would naturally be empty, and `res` would remain unchanged.

Thus, the state of `row` and `res` is still undetermined but dependent on the initial conditions provided. The variable `i` remains 9, unaffected by the assignment to `nRow`.

Output State: **`row` is non-empty or empty; `nRow` is an empty string; `res` remains unchanged; `i` is 9**
