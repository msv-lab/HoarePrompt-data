The code `nRow += i` concatenates the value of `i` to the existing value of `nRow`. The previous state of `nRow` is updated by appending the character represented by `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, including `res` which retains its previous value, `row` which is a non-empty string, and `i` which is the next character in `row`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending `i`.

Output State: **`res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending `i`**
