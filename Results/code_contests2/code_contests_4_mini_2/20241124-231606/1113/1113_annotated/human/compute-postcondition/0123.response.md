Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string derived from its original value. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is the original string concatenated with '1'. If `i` is any character other than '9', `nRow` is the original string concatenated with the character `i`, where `i` is the next character in the non-empty string `row`.***
