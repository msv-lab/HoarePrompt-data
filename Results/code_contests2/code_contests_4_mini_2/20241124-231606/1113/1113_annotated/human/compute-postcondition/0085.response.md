The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string '1'. Since the initial state does not provide the previous value of `nRow`, we can only state that it is being modified. The other variables `res`, `T`, `i`, and `row` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is the second character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 additional characters, and `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value.**
