According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. The variable `i` will take on each character of `row` one by one. 

At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` represents the last character processed in the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to the next character in the string. 

If `row` has a length of `m`, then `i` would be the `(m-1)`-th character. For the loop to potentially execute again, `i` must be adjusted to the `m`-th character, which is out of bounds for the loop. Therefore, `row` needs to be checked for its length, and since the loop is going to execute until all characters in `row` are processed, `nRow` would need to be updated depending on whether `i` is '9' or not during the current iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `i` so that it can access the next character in `row`, and `nRow` should reflect the result of appending '1' if `i` was '9' or the current value of `i` if not.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now the next character in `row`, and `nRow` would be updated accordingly.

State: **`nRow` is a string, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string**
