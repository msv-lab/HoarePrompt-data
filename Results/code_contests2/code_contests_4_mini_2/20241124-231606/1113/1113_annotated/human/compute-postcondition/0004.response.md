The code assigns `maxint` the value of positive infinity using `float('inf')`. The variables `t` and `write` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity**
