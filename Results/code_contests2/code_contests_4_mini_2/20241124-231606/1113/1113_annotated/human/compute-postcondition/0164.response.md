The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the string '1' to its previous value. The value of `nRow` would change accordingly, while `row` and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty iterable, `nRow` is updated to the value of the first element of `row` plus '1', `res` remains unchanged**
