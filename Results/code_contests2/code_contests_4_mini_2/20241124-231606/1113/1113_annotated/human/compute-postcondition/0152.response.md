The loop processes each character in the string `row`, replacing occurrences of '9' with '1' and appending other characters unchanged to the string `nRow`. 

If `row` is non-empty, the loop will execute for each character in `row`. If `row` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string.

Output State: **If `row` is non-empty, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters unchanged. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string.**
