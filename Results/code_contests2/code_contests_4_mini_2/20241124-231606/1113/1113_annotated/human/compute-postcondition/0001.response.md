The code registers a lambda function to be executed upon program termination, which writes the value of `sys.stdout` (redirected to an instance of `io.BytesIO()`) to the standard output (file descriptor 1). The previous states of the variables are not affected by this registration, and since it does not change any variable values or states directly, only modifies behavior on exit, the output state remains focused on the registration effect.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `sys.stdout` is redirected to an instance of `io.BytesIO()` and a function is registered to write to standard output on exit.**
