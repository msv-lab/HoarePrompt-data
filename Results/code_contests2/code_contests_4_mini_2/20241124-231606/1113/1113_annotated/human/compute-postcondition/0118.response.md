The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, the new value of `nRow` will simply be the value of `i`. The other variables (`res` and `row`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is equal to `i`, `res` contains 11 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is equal to `i`, `res` contains 11 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
