According to the code, the loop is set to iterate a fixed number of times, specifically 9 times. The loop variable `i` will take values from 0 to 8. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than 9. 

Since the state provided does not specify the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can infer that `i` must currently be 8 (the last value before it reaches 9). 

Given that `row` can be non-empty or empty, but that does not affect the loop's ability to iterate since the loop is based solely on `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 9.

No other states need to be adjusted regarding the variables `row`, `nRow`, or `res`, as they are not dependent on the loop's current iteration state.

State: **If `row` is non-empty, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1'; `res` now includes `nRow`. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string, and `res` remains unchanged; `i` is 9.**
