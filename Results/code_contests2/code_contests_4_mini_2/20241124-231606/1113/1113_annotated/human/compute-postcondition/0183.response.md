According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. The loop will execute again as long as there are more characters in the string `row`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a character that is not equal to '9', which indicates that `row` has been iterated partially. The variable `nRow` contains the value of `i` which is not '9', and since `row` is non-empty, it means there are still characters left to be processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next character in `row` after the current value of `i`. If `row` had at least one more character after the current `i`, `nRow` should reflect that next character or its corresponding value as per the condition. 

Since we don't know the length of `row`, we can't specify a particular value, but we can say that `nRow` should be updated to reflect the next character in `row` after `i`.

State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the next character in `row`, `res` remains unchanged, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string.**
