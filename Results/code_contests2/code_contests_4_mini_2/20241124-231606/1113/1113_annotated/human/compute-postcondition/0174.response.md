According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to 8 (a total of 9 iterations). At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be less than 9 for the loop to execute one more time. Since `i` is currently at 8, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is incremented to 9. 

However, the loop will not execute again because `i` cannot be less than 9. Therefore, the condition should be adjusted to indicate that `i` is now 9, and the loop will not execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted because `nRow` and `res` have already been updated appropriately in the last iteration.

State: **`nRow` is the concatenation of elements from `row` with '9' replaced by '1'; `res` is unchanged, and `i` is 9**
