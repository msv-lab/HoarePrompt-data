Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is a string that can either be '9' or any other single character. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. If `i` is any other character, `nRow` is updated to the value of `i`, while `row` remains a non-empty string throughout the execution.***
