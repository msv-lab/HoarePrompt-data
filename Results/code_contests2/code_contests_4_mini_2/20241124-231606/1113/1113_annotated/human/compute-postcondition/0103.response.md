Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string that starts with '1'. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` becomes '11'. Otherwise, `nRow` is '1' followed by the character `i`, where `i` is the next character in `row` after '9'. The postcondition accounts for the case where `i` can be any character following '9' in the row, ensuring that `nRow` is updated appropriately based on the value of `i`.***
