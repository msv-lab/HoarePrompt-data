The code `nRow += i` appends the character `i` to the string `nRow`. The variable `i` holds the next character from the string `row`, which is guaranteed to be at least one character long since `row` has at least two characters. The previous value of `nRow` is retained and is now extended by the addition of `i`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is now `nRow` with the character `i` appended to it.

Output State: **`res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is now `nRow` with character `i` appended.**
