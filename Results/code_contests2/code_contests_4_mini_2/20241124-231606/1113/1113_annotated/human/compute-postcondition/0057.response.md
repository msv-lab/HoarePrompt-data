According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must still contain characters, meaning it needs to be a non-empty string. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a character from `row`, and since `row` is non-empty, it has at least one character left to iterate over. After executing the loop body for the last character, `i` will take the character at the current position in the string for the next iteration.

Since `i` will take the next character in `row`, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` will be the next character in `row` and `row` will still be a non-empty string. 

If `row` had more than one character, the next character for `i` would be the one after the last one processed. If `row` only had one character, then `row` would be empty after the last iteration.

Assuming `row` has at least two characters at the start of the loop and `i` is the first character during the last iteration, after the last iteration, `i` would be updated to the next character in the string.

State: **`res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`**
