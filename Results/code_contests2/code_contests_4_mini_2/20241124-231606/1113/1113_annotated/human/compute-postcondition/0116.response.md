`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1', so after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `res` contains 11 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` contains 11 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is '9'**
