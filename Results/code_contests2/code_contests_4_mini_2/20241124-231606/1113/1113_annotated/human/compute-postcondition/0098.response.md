The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after executing the code, `nRow` will now contain the value of `i`. The other variables, `res` and `row`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is `i`, `res` contains 10 modified strings, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is `i`, `res` contains 10 modified strings, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string**
