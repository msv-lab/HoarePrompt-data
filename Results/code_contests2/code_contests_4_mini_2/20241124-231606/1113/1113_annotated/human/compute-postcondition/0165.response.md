The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`. The previous value of `nRow` is the value of the first element of `row`, which is not specified but is known to be a valid value. The variable `res` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a non-empty iterable, `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to its previous value, and `res` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty iterable, `nRow` is updated by adding `i`, and `res` remains unchanged**
