The code `nRow += i` means that `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`, and we only know that `i` is the first character of `row`. The impact is that `nRow` will have an updated value, but without the original value of `nRow`, we cannot specify its final value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `nRow` is incremented by `i`.**
