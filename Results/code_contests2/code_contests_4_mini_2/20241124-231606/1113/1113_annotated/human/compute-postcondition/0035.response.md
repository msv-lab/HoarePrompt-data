The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the current value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is the first character of `row` (which is non-empty and not equal to '9'), `nRow` will now hold the value of that first character. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string**
