According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row`. If `row` has more characters remaining, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `i` is the next character in `row`. 

To determine what needs to be adjusted:
1. Since `row` is non-empty and has at least 2 characters, for the loop to execute again, `row` must have at least 3 characters remaining.
2. The variable `i` needs to be updated to the next character in `row`.

Thus, if `i` is currently pointing to the second character of `row`, the new value of `i` should be the third character in `row`. 

State: **`res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in `row`**
