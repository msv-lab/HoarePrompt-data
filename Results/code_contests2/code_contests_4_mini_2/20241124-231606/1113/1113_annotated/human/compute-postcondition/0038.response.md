The `nRow` variable is a string that initially includes the current character `i`. The code appends the character '1' to the end of the string `nRow`. The value of `i` does not change, and the state of other variables remains unaffected. 

After execution, `nRow` will contain the original characters followed by '1'.

Output State: **`nRow` is the original string plus '1', `i` is the next character in `row`**
