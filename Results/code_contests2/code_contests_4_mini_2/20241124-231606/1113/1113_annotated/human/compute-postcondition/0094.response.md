According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `row`, which is an input string. In order for the loop to execute, the string `row` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `row` contains at least one character. The variable `i` is currently set to 9, which does not impact the loop execution since `i` will be reassigned to each character in `row` during the loop iterations. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments must be made: `row` must be a non-empty string, and the current value of `i` is irrelevant because it will be overwritten.

State: **`nRow` is '', `res` contains 10 modified strings, `i` is irrelevant, `row` is a non-empty string**
