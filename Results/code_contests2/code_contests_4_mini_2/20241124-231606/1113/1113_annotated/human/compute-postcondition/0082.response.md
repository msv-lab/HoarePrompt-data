The code `nRow += i` increments `nRow` by the value of `i`. However, the previous value of `nRow` is not specified in the initial state, and since `i` is any character, it indicates that `i` could represent a string or a character that needs to be concatenated. The impact on the program only affects `nRow`, and the previous values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is any character, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one additional character, and `nRow` is incremented by `i`.**
