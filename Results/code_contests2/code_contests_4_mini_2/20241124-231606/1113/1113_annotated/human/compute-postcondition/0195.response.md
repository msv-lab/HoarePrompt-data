Output State: **`res` contains 18 modified strings, with each string formed by replacing all '9's in the corresponding input `row` with '1'. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains empty, and `res` remains unchanged. The loop will execute exactly 9 times, as dictated by the range, regardless of the content of the input since the loop is not dependent on `T`, `t`, or the initial state of `res`. If the input prompt is not provided, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain as it was initially (containing 18 strings).**
