The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its existing value. Initially, `nRow` is an empty string, so after execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `res` contains 10 modified strings, `i` is irrelevant, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` contains 10 modified strings, `i` is irrelevant, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is equal to '9'**
