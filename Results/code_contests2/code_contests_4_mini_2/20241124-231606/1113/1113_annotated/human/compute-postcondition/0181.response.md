The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` to it. Since `i` is currently 0, the empty string `nRow` becomes '0'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '0', `res` is unchanged, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is '0', `res` is unchanged, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
