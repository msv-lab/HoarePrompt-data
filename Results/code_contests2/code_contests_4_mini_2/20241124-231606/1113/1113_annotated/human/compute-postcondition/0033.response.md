`nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the operation, `nRow` will become '1'. The values of the other variables, `i` and `row`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string**
