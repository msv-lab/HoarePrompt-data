According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has reached 8, which is less than 9, meaning the loop can execute one more time. 

To prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 9 for the next iteration. The other variables, `nRow` and `res`, do not require adjustments since they are not directly dependent on the loop index.

State: **`nRow` is a string that consists of the characters from `row`, replacing each occurrence of '9' with '1'; `res` contains 9 modified strings, and `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is 9**
