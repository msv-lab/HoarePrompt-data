The operation `nRow += '1'` concatenates the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will contain the string '1'. The other variables (`res`, `T`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1'**.
