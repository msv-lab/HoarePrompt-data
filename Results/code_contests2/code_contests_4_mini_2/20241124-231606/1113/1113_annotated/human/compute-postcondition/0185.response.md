The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` is a string and `i` is the next character in `row`, after execution, `nRow` will now include that character. The states of the other variables, `res` and `row`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`nRow` is updated to include the next character in `row`, `res` remains unchanged, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string**
