According to the code, the loop can execute a total of 9 times, as defined by `range(9)`. The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 8. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be 8 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9.

No other states need to be adjusted as `nRow` and `res` are not directly affecting the loop's execution constraints based on the provided context.

State: **`nRow` is a modified string derived from `row`, `res` contains 12 modified strings (11 original + 1 added), `i` is 9**
