Postcondition: ***`row` is a non-empty iterable and `i` is the next element in `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to be `nRow + '1'`. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to be `nRow + i`, which means that in the case where `i` is not '9', `nRow` will incorporate the value of `i` as its new last element.***
