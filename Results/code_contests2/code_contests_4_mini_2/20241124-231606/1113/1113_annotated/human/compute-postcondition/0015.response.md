The code `nRow += i` attempts to concatenate the value of `i` to the string `nRow`. Given the initial state, `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is 0. The concatenation of an empty string and the string representation of `i` (which is '0') will result in `nRow` being updated to '0'. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '0', and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
