The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous state indicated that `nRow` was the concatenation of elements from `row` with '9' replaced by '1', but now it is reset to an empty string. The other variables `res` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `nRow` while the other variables stay the same.

Output State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` is unchanged, `i` is 9, `row` is the input string**
