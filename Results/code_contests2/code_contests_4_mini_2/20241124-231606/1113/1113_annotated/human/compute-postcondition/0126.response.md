The value of `nRow` is concatenated with `i`, where `i` is an additional character from `row`. Since `nRow` is derived from its last value, it will now include the character `i`. The other variable `row` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is the original string with an additional character `i` appended, and `row` has at least one more character remaining.

Output State: **`nRow` is the original string with an additional character `i` appended, and `row` has at least one more character remaining**
