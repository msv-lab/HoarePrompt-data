The operation `nRow += i` concatenates the current value of `nRow` with the value of `i`. Since `nRow` is an empty string initially, the new value of `nRow` will simply be the value of `i`. The other variables (`res`, `T`, and `row`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is now equal to `i`.**
