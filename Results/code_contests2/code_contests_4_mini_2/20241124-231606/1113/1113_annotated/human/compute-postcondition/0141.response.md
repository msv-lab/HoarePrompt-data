The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Given that `nRow` is currently an empty string and `i` is not equal to '9', the value of `i` is concatenated to `nRow`. Since `nRow` starts as an empty string, the result will simply be the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` contains 18 modified strings, `T` is at least 10, `t` is 9, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is `i`**
