According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. Since `row` remains a non-empty string throughout the execution, it needs to contain at least one more character for the loop to execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either '9' or any other single character. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1', but this does not affect the loop's ability to execute again. If `i` is any other character, `nRow` is updated to that character's value, but this also does not affect the subsequent execution of the loop.

Since `row` remains a non-empty string, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `row` must have at least one additional character after the last character processed in the previous iteration. 

Thus, if `i` was the last character of `row`, we need to ensure that `row` contains at least one more character in the next iteration.

State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is any character, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one additional character**
