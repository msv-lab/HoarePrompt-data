According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. The loop will iterate over each character in the `row` string. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one additional character, which means it has at least 2 characters. 

Since `i` can be any character and `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must still contain more characters. If `row` had one character left, the loop would not be able to execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that `row` has at least 2 characters and `i` should be set to the next character in `row`.

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `row` should contain at least 2 characters more than it did at the end of the last iteration (if it had 2, it should now have at least 3).
- `i` should be set to the next character in the `row`, which will be the second character if the original `row` had at least 2 characters.

State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is the second character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 additional characters**
