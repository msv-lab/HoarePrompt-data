The variable `nRow` is being concatenated with the string `'1'`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`, which means its previous state is unknown. Since no other variables are affected, the output state reflects that `nRow` has been modified, but we cannot determine its exact new value.

Output State: **`nRow` is modified to include '1', other variables remain unchanged**
