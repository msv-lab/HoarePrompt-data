The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This assignment directly changes the value of `nRow` from its previous state, which was a string consisting of the characters from `row` (with '9' replaced by '1'). The other variables `res`, `i`, and `row` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `nRow` while the other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`nRow` is '', `res` contains 10 modified strings, `i` is 9, `row` is the input string**
