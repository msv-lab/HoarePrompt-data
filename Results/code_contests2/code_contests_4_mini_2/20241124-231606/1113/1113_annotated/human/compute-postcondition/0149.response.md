`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the next character in `row`. The value of `nRow` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it will increase by the value represented by `i`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 18 modified strings, `T` is at least 10, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, and `i` is the next character in `row`. 

Output State: **`res` contains 18 modified strings, `T` is at least 10, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, and `i` is the next character in `row; nRow` is increased by `i`.**
