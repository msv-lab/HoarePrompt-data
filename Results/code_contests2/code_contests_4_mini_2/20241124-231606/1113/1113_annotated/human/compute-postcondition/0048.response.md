According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which is the index in the range of 9. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. 

Given that `res` has `nRow` appended to it at the end of the last iteration, we need to consider the state of `i`. Since the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 8, `i` would have reached 8 at the end of the last iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9.

State: **`res` has nRow appended to it, i is 9**
