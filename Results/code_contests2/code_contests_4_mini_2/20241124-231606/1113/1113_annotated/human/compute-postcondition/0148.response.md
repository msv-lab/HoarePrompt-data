The code assigns the value of `nRow` to be the current value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. The initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`, but it is implied that it exists. Therefore, after executing the code, `nRow` will have its value changed to include '1' at the end.

Since other variables (`res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, `i`) are not affected by this operation, the output state reflects the change in `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` contains 18 modified strings, `T` is at least 10, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `i` is the next character in `row,` and `nRow` is updated with '1' appended.**
