According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row`. If `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `i` is the next character in `row`. 

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- If `row` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again as long as there is still a next character for `i`.
- Since `i` is currently the next character in `row`, we can expect `i` to be updated to the next character in the string for the next iteration.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` will now be the next character in `row` and that `row` must still have at least one character remaining after the current `i`.

If `row` is a string with at least 2 characters, then for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least 2 characters remaining, and `i` should be updated to the next character in `row`.

State: **`res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated accordingly.**
