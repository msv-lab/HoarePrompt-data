The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables (`row`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a non-empty iterable, `nRow` is '1', `res` remains unchanged, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty iterable, `nRow` is '1', `res` remains unchanged, and `i` is equal to '9'**
