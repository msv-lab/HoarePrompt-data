The code appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. Since `nRow` is derived from `row`, which is a non-empty string, it has a value that is the result of replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1'. The previous value of `res` is not specified, but it already contains 11 modified strings. Therefore, after execution, `res` will contain 12 modified strings, with the last one being `nRow`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nRow` is a modified string derived from `row`, `res` contains 12 modified strings (11 original + 1 added)**
