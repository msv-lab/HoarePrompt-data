The variable `nRow` is modified by appending the value of `i` to it. Since `i` is the second character of `row`, its specific value is determined by the content of `row`. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, `i` itself is appended. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `nRow`, which now includes the appended character.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` has been modified to include `i`.**
