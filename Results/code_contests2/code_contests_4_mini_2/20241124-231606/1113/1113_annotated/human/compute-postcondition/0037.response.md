According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` string and the variable `i`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. If `row` contains at least one more character after the current character `i`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a string that starts as an empty string or has been updated based on the character `i`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` becomes '1'. For any other character in `row`, `nRow` includes the value of `i`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next character in `row`. Therefore, if `i` was the last character in `row`, the loop cannot execute again. However, since `i` is guaranteed to be a valid character from a non-empty `row`, it implies there are still characters left to iterate through.

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, we need to adjust `i` to the next character in `row`, and `nRow` will be updated accordingly based on this next character.

State: **`nRow` is a string that includes the current character `i`, `i` is the next character in `row`.**
