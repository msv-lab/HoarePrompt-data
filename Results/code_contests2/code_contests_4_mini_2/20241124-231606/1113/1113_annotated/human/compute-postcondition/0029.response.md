The variable `row` is assigned the value from `input().strip()`, which means it will contain a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed. The variable `nRow` remains unchanged as it was defined previously, and `i` retains its value of 9. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is the string formed by replacing each occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string with whitespace removed.

Output State: **`nRow` is the string formed by replacing each occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string with whitespace removed.**
