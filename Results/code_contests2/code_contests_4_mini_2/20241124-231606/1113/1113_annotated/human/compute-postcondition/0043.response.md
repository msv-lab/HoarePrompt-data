The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` includes the original characters plus the next character in `row`, the new value of `nRow` will be the original `nRow` concatenated with `i`. The state of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `nRow` includes the original characters plus the next character in `row`, and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` includes the original characters plus the next character in `row`, `i` is the next character in `row`**
