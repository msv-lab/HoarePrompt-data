The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but it is affected by this operation. The variables `row` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `nRow` is now `nRow + '1'` where `nRow` is the previous value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `nRow` is now `nRow + '1'`**
