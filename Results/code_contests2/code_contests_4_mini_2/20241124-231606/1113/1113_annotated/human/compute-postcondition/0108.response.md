To determine the modified state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the provided state and the loop.

1. We know that the loop iterates over each character in `row`.
2. The variable `i` is currently '9' at the end of the last iteration, which means `nRow` has become '11'.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character after '9' to continue the iteration.

Given the conditions:
- If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '11'.
- If `i` were any other character, `nRow` would become '1' followed by the next character in `row`.

Since `i` is '9' and `nRow` is '11', we need to check if there is another character in `row` after '9'. If `row` has at least one more character, then `i` will take the next character in `row`, which we can denote as `nextChar`.

So, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- `nRow` changes from '11' to '1' followed by `nextChar`, where `nextChar` is the character in `row` that follows '9'.
- `i` changes to `nextChar`.
- We need to ensure that `row` has at least one more character after '9'.

Thus, the modified state should reflect these changes:

State: **`nRow` is '1' followed by the next character in `row`, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` has at least one more character after '9'**
