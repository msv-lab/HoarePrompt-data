The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string `'1'`. Since the current state does not specify the initial value of `nRow`, we can only infer that it is a string to which `'1'` will be added. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is any character, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one additional character, and `nRow` is now the original value concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is any character, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one additional character, and `nRow` is now the original value concatenated with '1'**
