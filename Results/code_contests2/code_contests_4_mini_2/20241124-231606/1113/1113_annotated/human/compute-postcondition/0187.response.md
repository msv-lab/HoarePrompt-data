According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `row`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must take on the next character in `row`. Since `i` represents the current character, we need to set `i` to the next character in the string `row`. 

If `row` is a non-empty string, and given that `i` is currently the last character of `row`, the loop would not execute again. Therefore, we should ensure that `i` is updated to represent the next character in `row`, and we need to know the current state of `nRow` as it changes with the characters of `i`.

State: **`nRow` is updated according to the character `i`, `res` remains unchanged, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string**
