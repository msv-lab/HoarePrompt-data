The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take user input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `res`, `T`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the exact value of `row` will depend on the user input. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed**.
