Postcondition: ***`res` contains 18 modified strings, `T` is at least 10, `t` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, and `i` is the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to include '1' at the end. If `i` is any other character, `nRow` is updated by appending `i` to its end.***
