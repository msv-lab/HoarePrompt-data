The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string, but it does not affect any of the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 18 modified strings, `T` is at least 10, `t` is 9, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`res` contains 18 modified strings, `T` is at least 10, `t` is 9, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is an empty string**
