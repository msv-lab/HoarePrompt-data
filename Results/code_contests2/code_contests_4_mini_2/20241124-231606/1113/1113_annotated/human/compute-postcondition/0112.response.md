The value of `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes user input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of `nRow`, `res`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is a string that contains the modified version of `row`, `res` contains 11 modified strings, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the modified version of `row`, `res` contains 11 modified strings, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace**
