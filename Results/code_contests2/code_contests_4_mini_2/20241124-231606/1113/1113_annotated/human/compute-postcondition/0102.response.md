`nRow` is a string that initially contains '1'. The variable `i` is the next character in `row` after '9', which means it is a single character. The operation `nRow += i` concatenates `i` to the end of the string `nRow`. 

Since `nRow` is initially '1', and `i` is a character, the resulting value of `nRow` will be '1' followed by the character `i`. The state of `i` and any other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1' followed by the character `i`, `i` is the next character in `row` after '9'**
