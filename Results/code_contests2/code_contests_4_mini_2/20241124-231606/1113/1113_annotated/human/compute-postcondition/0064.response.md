Postcondition: ***`res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `i` is the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to be the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending `i` to its previous value.***
