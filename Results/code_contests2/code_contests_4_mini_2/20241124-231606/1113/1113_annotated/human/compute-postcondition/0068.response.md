According to the code, the loop iterates over a range of 9. The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 8. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `i` must be adjusted to allow the loop to execute one more time. 

Since `i` is currently 8, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 9, which means that the loop will no longer be able to execute because the range is from 0 to 8 (inclusive).

No other states need to be adjusted as `nRow` and `res` are not involved in the loop's ability to run again.

State: **`nRow` is a string where every occurrence of '9' in `row` has been replaced with '1', and all other characters from `row` are retained in their original order; `res` now includes `nRow` appended to its previous value, `i` is 9**
