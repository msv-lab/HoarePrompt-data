The code appends the modified string `nRow` to the list `res`. Since `res` already contains 10 modified strings, the length of `res` will now be 11 after this operation. The values of `nRow` and `res` are affected, but the content of `nRow` remains unchanged, while `res` is incremented by one element.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the modified version of `row`, `res` contains 11 modified strings**
