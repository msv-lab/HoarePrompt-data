The variable `row` is assigned the value from `input().strip()`, which means it will hold the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The value of `res` and the variable `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string after stripping.

Output State: **`res` has nRow appended to it, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string after stripping**
