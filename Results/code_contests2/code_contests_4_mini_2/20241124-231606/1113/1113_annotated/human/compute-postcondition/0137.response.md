According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least 1 character. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 0, which is appropriate for the loop's first iteration. 

Given the provided states, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that `row` is a non-empty string. 

State: **`res` contains 18 modified strings, `T` is at least 10, `t` is 9, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string**
