The operation `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. The initial value of `nRow` is '1', so after the operation, `nRow` will be '11'. The variable `i` and the contents of `row` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '11', `i` is the next character in `row` after '9', `row` contains more characters after '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is '11', `i` is the next character in `row` after '9', `row` contains more characters after '9'**
