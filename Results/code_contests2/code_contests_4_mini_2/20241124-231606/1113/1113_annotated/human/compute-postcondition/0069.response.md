Output State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings where each occurrence of '9' in the corresponding `row` input is replaced with '1', while all other characters remain unchanged; if a `row` input is empty, `nRow` is an empty string and is appended to `res`. The loop executes exactly 9 times regardless of input, so `res` will always contain 9 elements, even if they are empty strings.**
