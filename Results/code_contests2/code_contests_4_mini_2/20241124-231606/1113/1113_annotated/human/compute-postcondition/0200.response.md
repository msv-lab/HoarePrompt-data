Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and processes a specified number of test cases (up to 10,000) where each test case consists of 9 rows of input strings containing digits. It replaces every occurrence of '9' in each row with '1' and stores the modified rows in a list. The function outputs the modified rows as a single string, joining them with newline characters. If fewer than 9 rows are provided during execution, the function may raise errors due to insufficient input, and if the number of test cases is 0, the output will be empty. **
