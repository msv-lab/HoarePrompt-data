The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string `'1'` to its current value. The initial state mentions that `nRow` is updated according to the character `i`, but the exact previous value is not specified. The variable `res` remains unchanged, and `i` is the next character in `row`, which is also unspecified. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` has been updated by appending `'1'` while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated by appending '1'; `res` remains unchanged; `i` is the next character in `row`**
