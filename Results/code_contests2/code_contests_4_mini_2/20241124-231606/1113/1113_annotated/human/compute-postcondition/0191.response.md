According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. The variable `i` represents the next character in the non-empty string `row`. Since `i` has been updated to the next character, we need to ensure that the loop can continue executing.

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` represents the next character in the string `row`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain more characters beyond the current character represented by `i`. 

To determine the next state:
- If `i` is currently the last character of `row`, there are no more characters to iterate over, and the loop cannot execute again.
- However, if there are more characters in `row`, we need to update `i` to the next character in `row`.

Assuming `row` has at least one more character after the current `i`, we need to adjust `i` to represent the next character in `row`.

State: **`nRow` is updated by appending '1' if `i` is '9'; otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i` to its current value, `res` remains unchanged, `i` is the next character in `row`**
