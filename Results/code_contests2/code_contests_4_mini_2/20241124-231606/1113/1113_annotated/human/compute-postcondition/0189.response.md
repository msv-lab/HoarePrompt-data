The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i` to it. The variable `res` remains unchanged, `i` is the next character in `row`, and the string `row` is non-empty. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is updated according to the character `i`, `res` remains unchanged, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated according to the character `i`, `res` remains unchanged, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string**
