Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is the second character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' if `i` is '9'; otherwise, `nRow` is increased by concatenating the value of `i`. This ensures that if `i` is '9', `nRow` will have '1' appended, while for any other character, the character `i` will be appended to `nRow`.***
