The variable `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. Thus, `T` will also be an integer within the same range. Other variables (`write`, `maxint`, and `res`) remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` is an empty list; `T` is an input integer within the same range.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` is an empty list; `T` is an input integer within the same range.**
