The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the current character `i` to it. Given that `nRow` starts with '1' and `i` is the next character in `row`, after execution, `nRow` will now be '1' followed by the character represented by `i`. The state of `i` is unknown, but `nRow` changes accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1' followed by `i`, `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1' followed by `i`, `i` is the next character in `row`**
