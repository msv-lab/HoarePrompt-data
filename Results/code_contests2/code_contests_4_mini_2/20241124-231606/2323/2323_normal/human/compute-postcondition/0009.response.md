According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue executing as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is equal to `a // 100`. 

Given that `a` is at least 10, the minimum value of `copya` would be `10 // 100`, which is 0. However, since `copya` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `a` is adjusted such that `copya` remains positive. 

For `copya` to be greater than 0, `a` must be at least 100. Therefore, we need to adjust `a` to be at least 100.

State: **`Stepan's integer` is a positive integer represented as a string of digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is at least 100, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and `copya` is equal to `a // 100`**
