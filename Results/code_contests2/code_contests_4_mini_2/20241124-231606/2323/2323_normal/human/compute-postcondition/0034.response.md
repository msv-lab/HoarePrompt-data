Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `c` is greater than 0, and `copya` is 0, `i` is 1. If `a` is not divisible by 10, then `h` is equal to `a % 10`, `a` is updated by removing its last digit and prepending `h` multiplied by `10 ** c`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `a % b`. If `a` is divisible by 10, then `h` is equal to `a % 10`, and `a` is similarly updated by removing its last digit and prepending `h` multiplied by `10 ** c`. In both cases, the final value of `a` is modified, but `ans` is only updated in the case where `a` is not divisible by 10.***
