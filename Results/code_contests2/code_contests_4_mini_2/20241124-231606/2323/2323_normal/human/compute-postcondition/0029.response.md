The variable `a` is updated with the expression `10 ** c * h + a`. Here, `10 ** c` calculates 10 raised to the power of `c`, and `h` is the last digit of `a` (since `h` is `a % 10`). The previous value of `a` is greater than 0, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `i` is 1, and `h` is the last digit of `a`.

After executing the code:
1. The value of `h` remains unchanged, as it is derived from `a % 10`.
2. The result of `10 ** c * h` is calculated and added to the current value of `a`.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `a` and retains the previous values of the other variables as they are unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is updated, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `i` is 1, `h` is `a % 10**
