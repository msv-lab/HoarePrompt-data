The value of `a` is updated to `10`, but the value of `b` is unknown, and `ans` is also unknown. The expression `a % b` calculates the remainder of `10` divided by `b`. The function `min(ans, a % b)` will then return the smaller of `ans` and `10 % b`. However, since `ans` and `b` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` after this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is 10, `b` is unknown, `ans` is updated to `min(ans, 10 % b)`.

Output State: **`a` is 10, `b` is unknown, `ans` is updated to `min(ans, 10 % b)`**
