The value of `h` is assigned the result of `a % 10`. Since `a` is stated to be a multiple of 10, `a % 10` will equal 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is greater than 0, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is `a % b`, `i` is 0, `h` is 0, and `a` is a multiple of 10.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is `a % b`, `i` is 0, `h` is 0, and `a` is a multiple of 10**
