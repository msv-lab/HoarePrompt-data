The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates on a positive integer represented as a string of digits, referred to as Stepan's integer, which has a length between 2 and 200,000. Additionally, it utilizes an integer `m` that falls within the range of 2 to 10^8.

Since there is no clear output specified in the provided output format, we cannot determine specific return cases. Therefore, we will focus on the constraints given.

Functionality: **The function operates on a positive integer represented as a string of digits (Stepan's integer) with a length between 2 and 200,000, and utilizes an integer m that is between 2 and 10^8.**
