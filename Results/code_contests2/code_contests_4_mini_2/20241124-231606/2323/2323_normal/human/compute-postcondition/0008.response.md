`c` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 1. Therefore, after execution, `c` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `Stepan's integer` is a positive integer represented as a string of digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is at least 10, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and `copya` is equal to `a // 100.
