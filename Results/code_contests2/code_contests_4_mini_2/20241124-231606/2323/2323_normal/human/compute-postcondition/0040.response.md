The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which calculates the remainder when `a` is divided by 10. Since `a` is greater than 0, `h` will be a positive integer between 0 and 9, depending on the specific value of `a`. The values of `c`, `copya`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is greater than 0, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `i` is 2, and `h` is `a % 10` (a positive integer between 0 and 9).

Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `i` is 2, and `h` is `a % 10` (a positive integer between 0 and 9)**
