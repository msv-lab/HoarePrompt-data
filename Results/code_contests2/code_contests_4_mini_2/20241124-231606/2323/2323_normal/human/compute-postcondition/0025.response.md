Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `c` is greater than 0, and `copya` is 0. If `a` is not a multiple of 10, then `h` is the last digit of `a`, `a` is updated to a new value by moving `h` to the higher place values, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the new `a` modulo `b`. If `a` is a multiple of 10, `h` is 0, `a` is updated similarly, but `ans` remains unchanged as `a % b` since it was not recalculated. In both cases, `i` remains 0.***
