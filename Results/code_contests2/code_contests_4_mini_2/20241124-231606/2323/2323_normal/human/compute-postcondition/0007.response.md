The variable `copya` is assigned the value of `a // 10`. Given that `copya` is initialized as `a // 10`, the operation `copya //= 10` will perform an integer division of `copya` by 10. Since `copya` is `a // 10`, the new value of `copya` will be `(a // 10) // 10`, which simplifies to `a // 100`. 

The states of the other variables (`Stepan's integer`, `m`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `Stepan's integer` is a positive integer represented as a string of digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is at least 10, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, and `copya` is now equal to `a // 100`.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a positive integer represented as a string of digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is at least 10, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, and `copya` is equal to `a // 100**
