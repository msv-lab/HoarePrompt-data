The value of `c` is incremented by 1, and since `c` is initially 2, after execution, `c` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `Stepan's integer` is a positive integer represented as a string of digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is at least 100, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, and `copya` is equal to `a // 100 // 10`.
