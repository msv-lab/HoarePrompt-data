Output State: **If `a` is greater than 0 and `c` is greater than 0, then after the loop executes `c` times, `a` will have had its digits rearranged based on the last digit moved to the front for each iteration, and `ans` will be the minimum of its initial value and the new `a` modulo `b` for each time `a` was not a multiple of 10. If `a` is initially 0, `c` remains 0, `copya` is equal to 0, and the loop does not execute, leaving `ans` unchanged. If `c` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains as it was initialized.**
