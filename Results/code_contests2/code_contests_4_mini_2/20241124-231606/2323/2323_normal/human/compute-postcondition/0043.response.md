Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0; if `a` is not a multiple of 10, then `h` is the last digit of `a`, `a` is reduced by one digit, and `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`, while `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `a % b`. If `a` is a multiple of 10, then `h` is the last digit of `a`, `a` is reduced by one digit, and `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`, with no change to `ans`. In both cases, `c` is greater than 0, and `copya` remains 0, with `i` equal to 2.***
