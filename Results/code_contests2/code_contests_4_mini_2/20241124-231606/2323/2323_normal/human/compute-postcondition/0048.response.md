Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer inputs, `a` and `b`, where `a` is expected to have a non-zero length and `b` is a positive integer. It calculates the minimum value of `a % b` after attempting to rearrange the digits of `a` by moving the last non-zero digit to the front. If `a` is zero, the function simply returns `0` as the result of `0 % b`. The function prints this minimum value. However, it does not handle the case where `b` could be zero, which would result in a division error if encountered. **
