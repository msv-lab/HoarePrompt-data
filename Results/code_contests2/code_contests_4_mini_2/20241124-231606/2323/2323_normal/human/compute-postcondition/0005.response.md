The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 0, so after execution, `c` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `Stepan's integer` is a positive integer represented as a string of digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, and `copya` is equal to `a // 10`.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a positive integer represented as a string of digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, and `copya` is equal to `a // 10**
