The value of `h` is equal to `a % 10`. Since `a` is greater than or equal to 0, this means `h` is a non-negative integer less than 10 (0 to 9). After substituting `h`, the expression `10 ** c * h` is calculated, where `c` is greater than 0, leading to `10 ** c` being a positive power of 10. Therefore, `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`, which means `a` will increase significantly based on the value of `c` and `h`. The values of `copya`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`, `copya` is 0, `i` is 2, `h` is `a % 10`**
