The variable `copya` is assigned the value of `a`, and then `copya` is integer-divided by 10. The result of this operation will depend on the initial value of `a`. Since `copya` is equal to `a` before the operation, the new value of `copya` will be `a // 10`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `Stepan's integer` is a positive integer represented as a string of digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, and `copya` is equal to `a // 10`.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a positive integer represented as a string of digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, and `copya` is equal to `a // 10**
