The variable `copya` is assigned the value of `a`. The variable `a` is an input integer, so `copya` now holds the same value as `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `Stepan's integer` is a positive integer represented as a string of digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, and `copya` is equal to `a`.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a positive integer represented as a string of digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, and `copya` is equal to `a**
