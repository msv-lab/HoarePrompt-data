According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `c`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `c`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `c` is greater than 0. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2.

Since `c` is greater than 0, we do not need to modify `c`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect the incremented value of `i`.

State: **`a` is greater than 0, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `i` is 2**
