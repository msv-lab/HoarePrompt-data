The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Since `a` is greater than 0, `a % 10` will yield a positive integer between 0 and 9. The other variables (`c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `h` based on the value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is `a % b`, `i` is 0, `a % 10` is not equal to 0, and `h` is `a % 10`**
