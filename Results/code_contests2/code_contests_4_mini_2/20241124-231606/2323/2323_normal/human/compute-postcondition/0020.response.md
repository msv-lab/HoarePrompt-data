The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the result of `a % b`. The value of `a` is 10, but the value of `b` is not provided, so we cannot calculate `a % b` without knowing `b`. Therefore, we cannot determine the new value of `ans`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is updated to 10; `ans` is updated to min(ans, a % b), where a is 10 and b is unknown**
