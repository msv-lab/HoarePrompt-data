According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is non-zero (truthy), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is equal to `a // 100 // 10`. Since `a` is at least 100, we can determine that `copya` is at least 1 (as 100 // 100 // 10 equals 0, but any `a` greater than 100 will yield a positive integer for `copya`).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must remain non-zero. There are no other states that need to be adjusted.

State: **`Stepan's integer` is a positive integer represented as a string of digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is at least 100, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, and `copya` is greater than 0**
