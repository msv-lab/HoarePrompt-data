The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Since `a` is greater than 0, the value of `h` will be the remainder when `a` is divided by 10, which will be a value between 0 and 9. The values of `c`, `copya`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is greater than 0, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `i` is 1, and `h` is `a % 10`.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `i` is 1, and `h` is `a % 10`**
