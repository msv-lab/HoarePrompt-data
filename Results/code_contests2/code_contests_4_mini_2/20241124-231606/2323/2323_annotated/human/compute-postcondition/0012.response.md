According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is greater than zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is greater than or equal to 1, which ensures that the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the states.

State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `b` is an input integer within the range of 2 to 10^8; `c` is 3; `copya` is greater than or equal to 1**
