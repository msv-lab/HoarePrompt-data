The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 2, so after execution, `c` becomes 3. The values of `a`, `b`, and `copya` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `b` is an input integer within the range of 2 to 10^8; `c` is 3; `copya` is greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `b` is an input integer within the range of 2 to 10^8; `c` is 3; `copya` is greater than or equal to 1**
