The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The initial states of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `b` is an input integer within the range of 2 to 10^8; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `b` is an input integer within the range of 2 to 10^8; `c` is 0**
