According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue executing as long as `copya` is not zero. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `copya` is defined as `copya // 10`, this means that for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must be greater than 0 after this operation.

Since `copya` is currently `copya // 10`, we need to ensure that `copya` is at least 10 (which would make `copya // 10` equal to 1). Therefore, we need to make sure that the initial value of `copya` was at least 10 before the operation was performed.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `b` is an input integer within the range of 2 to 10^8; `c` is 2; `copya` is greater than or equal to 10**
