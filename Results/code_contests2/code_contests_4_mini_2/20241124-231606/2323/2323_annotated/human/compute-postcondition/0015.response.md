According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`, which represents the number of digits in `a`. Since `a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `c` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `i` will have taken on values from 0 to `c-1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `c` must be at least 2, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, `c` is at least 2, `i` is 0**
