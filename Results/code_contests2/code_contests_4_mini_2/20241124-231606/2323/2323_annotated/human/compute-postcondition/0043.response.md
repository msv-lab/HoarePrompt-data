Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits, `h` is the last digit of the original `a`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `a % b` if the last digit of `a` is not zero; if the last digit of `a` is zero, `ans` remains unchanged. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1 and `c` remains unchanged. The variable `a` is modified by removing its last digit and then updating it to `10 ** c * h + a`, where `h` is the last digit of the original `a`.***
