According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c`. The loop will execute `c` times, and `i` is used as the index, starting from 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` remains 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented.

Since `c` is at least 2, and `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one additional time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1. The value of `c` does not need to be changed as it is already at least 2.

State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits, `ans` is unchanged, `h` is the last digit of `a` before modification, `i` is 1, `c` is at least 2**
