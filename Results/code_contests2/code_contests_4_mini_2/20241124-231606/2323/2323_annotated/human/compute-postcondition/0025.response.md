Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits. If `a % 10 != 0`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `a % b`, where `b` is at least 2, and `c` is at least 2. If `a % 10 == 0`, then `ans` remains unchanged, and `h` is 0. In both cases, `a` is modified to be a positive integer with one less digit after removing the last digit, and `h` takes the value of the last digit of `a` before modification. `i` remains 0.***
