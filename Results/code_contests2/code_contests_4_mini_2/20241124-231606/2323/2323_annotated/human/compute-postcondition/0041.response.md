The operation `a //= 10` performs an integer division of `a` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `a`. The variable `h`, which is the last digit of `a`, will change if `a` has more than one digit, but since `h` is not explicitly updated in this code snippet, it will still hold the value of the last digit before the operation. Other variables (`ans`, `i`, and `c`) remain unchanged in this operation.

Given that `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits, `a //= 10` will reduce `a` by one digit.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits reduced by one digit; `h` remains the last digit of the original `a`; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `a % b`; `i` is incremented by 1; `c` remains unchanged.**
