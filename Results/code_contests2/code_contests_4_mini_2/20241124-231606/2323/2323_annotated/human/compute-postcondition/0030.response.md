The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the result of `a % b`. Since `a` is `10`, the expression `a % b` will yield the remainder of `10` divided by `b`. However, the value of `b` is not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact result of `a % b`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the fact that `ans` is being updated based on the minimum value involving `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is 10; `ans` is updated to min(ans, 10 % b)**
