Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, where `a` can be a very large positive integer (up to 200,000 digits) and `b` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^8. It calculates `a % b` and then modifies `a` by moving its last non-zero digit to the front, repeating this process to find the minimum value of `a % b` for all such configurations of `a`. The final result, which is the minimum modulo value, is printed. However, the function does not explicitly return any value, and if `a` has no non-zero digits, the initial modulo value remains unchanged.**
