The value of `copya` is divided by 10 using the floor division operator `//`. Since `copya` is non-zero, this operation will reduce its value but will keep it an integer. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `copya`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `b` is an input integer within the range of 2 to 10^8; `c` is 1; `copya` is copya // 10 (which is copya divided by 10)**
