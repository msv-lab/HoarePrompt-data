The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates with two variables: `a`, which is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, and `b`, which is an integer such that 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^8. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot describe the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with the integer `a` and the integer `b` under the given constraints. 

Functionality: **The function operates with a positive integer `a` (2 to 200,000 digits) and an integer `b` (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^8), but the return value is not specified.**
