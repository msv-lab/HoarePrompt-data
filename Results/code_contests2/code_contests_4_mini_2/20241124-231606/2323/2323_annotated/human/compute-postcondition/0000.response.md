The variable `a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts that input to an integer. The value of `a` will be a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, while `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^8.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^8**
