The variable `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `b` is not known, but it is constrained between 2 and \(10^8\). The variable `a` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `b` is an input integer within the range of 2 to \(10^8\).

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `b` is an input integer within the range of 2 to 10^8**
