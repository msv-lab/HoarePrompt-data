`copya` is assigned the value of `a`, which is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits. The values of the other variables `b` and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `b` is an input integer within the range of 2 to 10^8; `c` is 0; `copya` is the same as `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `b` is an input integer within the range of 2 to 10^8; `c` is 0; `copya` is the same as `a`**
