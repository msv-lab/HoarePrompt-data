Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits. If `a` is not a multiple of 10, the last digit `h` is stored, `a` is divided by 10, and the new value of `a` is formed by placing `h` at the 10^c position, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `a % b`. If `a` is a multiple of 10, the last digit `h` is stored, and `a` is adjusted similarly without changing `ans`. In both cases, `h` is the last digit of the original `a` before modification, and the length of `a` remains valid throughout.***
