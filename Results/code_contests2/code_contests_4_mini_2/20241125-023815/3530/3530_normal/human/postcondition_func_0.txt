The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` from input, followed by `n` rows of integers to create a 2D list `a`. It initializes a dynamic programming table `dp` to compute and store combinations based on the input data. The function ultimately prints the value of `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]`, which represents the number of valid combinations of the inputs modulo `1000000007`. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is 0, resulting in an empty 2D list, or where all elements in `a` are 0, potentially affecting the output. The function does not return a value; it prints the final result instead.
