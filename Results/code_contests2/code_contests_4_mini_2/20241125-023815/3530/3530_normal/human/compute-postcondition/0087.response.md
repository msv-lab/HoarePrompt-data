Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute exactly `n` times with `j` taking values from 0 to `n-1`. For each iteration, if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. If either condition is not satisfied for a value of `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged with all elements in `dp[0]` set to 1.**
