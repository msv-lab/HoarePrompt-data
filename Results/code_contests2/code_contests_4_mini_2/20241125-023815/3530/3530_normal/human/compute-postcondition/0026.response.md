Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where all elements in the first row (`dp[0]`) are set to 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set (i.e., the condition `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the sum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, with the result taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
