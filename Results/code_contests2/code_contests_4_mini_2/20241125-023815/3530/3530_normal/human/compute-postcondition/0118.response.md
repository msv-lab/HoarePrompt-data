According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3. 

Since `n` is greater than 1, it indicates that there is at least one more iteration possible because `j` can be 3 and still satisfy the loop condition (as long as `n` is at least 4). 

Therefore, the states to be adjusted are:
- `j` needs to be updated to 3.

No changes need to be made to `dp`, `mask`, and `n` as they are not affected by the loop iteration.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `n` is greater than 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 3**
