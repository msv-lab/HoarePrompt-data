The code updates the value at `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `mask` is 1.
- `j` is 2.

The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` computes the new index for the second dimension of the `dp` list. Since `mask` is currently 1 (binary `01`) and `1 << j` (where `j` is 2) results in `4` (binary `100`), the XOR operation `mask ^ 4` results in `5` (binary `101`).

Thus, the update will be:

`dp[2][1] += dp[1][5]`

The output state will reflect that `dp[2][1]` has been updated based on the previous state of `dp[1][5]`. Other variables remain unchanged in this case.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `mask` is 1; `j` is 2; and `dp[2][1]` is updated by adding `dp[1][5]`.**
