According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Since `j` is currently 2, the next value for `j` would be 3, and for this to be valid, `n` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `n` must be at least 3 for `j` to be 3.
- `j` should be updated to 3.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, and `j` is 3**
