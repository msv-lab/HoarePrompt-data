The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of itself with respect to `MOD`. This operation ensures that the value of `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. Other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value `dp[i][mask] % MOD**
