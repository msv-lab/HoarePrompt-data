The statement `dp[0][i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the first row (index 0) of the `dp` list at the column indexed by `i`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `dp` is a list of lists initialized with zeros, and `i` is 0. Therefore, after the execution, the value at `dp[0][0]` will be changed to 1, while the other values in `dp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, each having `1 << n` columns initialized to 0, `i` is 0, and `dp[0][0]` is 1**
