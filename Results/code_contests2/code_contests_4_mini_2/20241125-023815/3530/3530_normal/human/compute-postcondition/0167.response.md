The line of code updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and then applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not known, but it is affected by the earlier update which added `dp[i - 1][7]` to it. After executing the code, `dp[i][mask]` will be the result of `(previous value of dp[i][mask] + dp[i - 1][7]) % MOD`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulus operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulus operation.**
