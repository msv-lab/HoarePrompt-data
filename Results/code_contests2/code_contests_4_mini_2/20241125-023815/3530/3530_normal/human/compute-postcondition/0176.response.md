The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the provided constraints that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, and `a` is a 2D list of integers where `a[i][j]` is either 0 or 1, representing the compatibility between Man `i` and Woman `j`. The function likely returns a result based on the compatibility data in the 2D list. However, the specifics of the output are not described. 

Functionality: **The function does not take any parameters and likely returns a result based on the compatibility data represented in a 2D list of integers.**
