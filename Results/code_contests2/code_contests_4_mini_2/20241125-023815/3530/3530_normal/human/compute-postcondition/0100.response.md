The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is based on the update from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, and since `mask` is at its maximum and `j` is equal to `n`, we can infer that `dp[i][mask]` will be reduced to a value that is less than `MOD`. Other variables remain unaffected in this context.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` and reduced by modulo `MOD`.**
