According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, which is already satisfied since we have `n` is greater than 0. The loop variable `j` will start from 0 and will iterate until `n - 1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `j` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` has reached the maximum value of `1 << n - 1`, `j` is 0**
