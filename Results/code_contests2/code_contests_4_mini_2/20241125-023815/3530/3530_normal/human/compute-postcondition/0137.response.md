According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1` and `j` is `n`. Since `j` is equal to `n`, the loop cannot execute again unless `j` is adjusted to `n + 1`, which is outside the range of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted to be `n` (the loop's starting point) and `i` remains unchanged, but `j` must be incremented to `n + 1`, which makes `j` out of the loop's range.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and `j` is `n`**
