Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where all elements in the first row (`dp[0]`) are set to 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitmask `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The result is taken modulo `MOD`. If for all `j` (from 0 to n-1) the condition `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `dp` remains unchanged, with `dp[0]` still filled with 1s.**
