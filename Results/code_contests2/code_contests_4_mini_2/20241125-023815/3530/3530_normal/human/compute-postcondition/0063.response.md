According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. The state indicates that at the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `n` remains unchanged, we do not need to adjust it. 

Given that the loop's condition depends on `j` being less than `n`, and since `j` is currently 1, the loop can execute again if `j` is updated to 2.

State: **`dp` remains a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `j` is 2, and `n` is unchanged.**
