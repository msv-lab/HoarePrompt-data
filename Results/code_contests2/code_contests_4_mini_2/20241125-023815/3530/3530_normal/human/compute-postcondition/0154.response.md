Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes up to `n` times with `j` taking values from 0 to `n-1`. For each `j`, if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or the condition `mask & 1 << j` is false for all `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
