According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to 1. Since there is no indication that `n` has changed, it remains as is.

State: **`dp` remains a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `j` is 1, and `n` is unchanged**
