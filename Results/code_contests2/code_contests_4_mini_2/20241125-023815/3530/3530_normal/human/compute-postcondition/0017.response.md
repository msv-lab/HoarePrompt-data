The value of `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value `1`. Since `i` is `2`, `dp[0][2]` will be set to `1`. The other values in the list `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, each having `1 << n` columns initialized to 0, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1, and `dp[0][2]` is 1.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, each having `1 << n` columns initialized to 0, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1, `dp[0][2]` is 1**
