Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met (i.e., either `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or the bit at position `j` in `mask` is not set), then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
