According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the condition that the loop continues while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j`, and the value of `j` should be updated to 2. No other states need to be adjusted because `dp` and `mask` are not directly affected by the loop's iteration and `n` is already greater than 1.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `n` is greater than 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 2**
