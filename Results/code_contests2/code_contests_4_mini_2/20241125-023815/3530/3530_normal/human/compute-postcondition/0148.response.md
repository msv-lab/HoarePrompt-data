Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
