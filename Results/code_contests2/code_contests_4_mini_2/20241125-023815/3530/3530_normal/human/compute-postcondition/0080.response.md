The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates `dp[i][mask]` with the remainder of its current value when divided by `MOD`. The value of `dp[2][1]` would be affected by this operation.

Since `dp[2][1]` was previously updated with `dp[1][3]`, we need to consider the value of `dp[1][3]`. However, the specific value of `dp[1][3]` and `MOD` is not provided in the initial state.

Thus, the output state reflects that `dp[2][1]` is updated to its current value modulo `MOD`, but without specific values, we cannot determine the exact result.

Output State: **`dp[2][1]` is updated to `dp[2][1] % MOD`**
