According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing still holds since `1 << n` is greater than 2 for any `n` greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, each having `1 << n` columns initialized to 0, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1**
