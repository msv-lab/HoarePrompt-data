According to the code, the loop iterates over `mask` in the range from 1 to `1 << n`, which means it will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `dp` remains a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, and `mask` must be less than `1 << n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` must take on the next value. Currently, `mask` is at its maximum value of `1 << n - 1`. To adjust for the next iteration, `mask` needs to be `1 << n`, which is the limit of the loop and indicates that the loop will no longer execute since `mask` will not be in the valid range for iteration.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `mask`, which should be `1 << n`. Since `n` is still valid and has not changed, we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`dp` remains a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `mask` is equal to 1 << n**
