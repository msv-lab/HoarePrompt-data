According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `mask` can take on values from `1` to `1 << n - 1`, which corresponds to all the possible non-zero masks for `n` bits. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is currently at its maximum value which is `1 << n - 1`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the `mask` needs to be incremented to `1 << n`, which is outside the current range of the loop. Since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `1 << n`, if `n` is greater than 0, the loop cannot execute again because `mask` has already reached its upper limit.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, we need to ensure that `n` is increased to allow `mask` to have additional values. Thus, we need to set the condition that `n` must be at least 1.

State: **`dp` remains a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.**
