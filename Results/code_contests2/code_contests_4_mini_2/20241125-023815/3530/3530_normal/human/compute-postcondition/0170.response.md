Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 3, `n` is at least 2, and `j` will take values from 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo `MOD`. If either `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or `mask & 1 << j` is zero, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged.**
