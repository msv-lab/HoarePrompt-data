Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the condition `mask & 1 << j` holds true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If either of these conditions is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
