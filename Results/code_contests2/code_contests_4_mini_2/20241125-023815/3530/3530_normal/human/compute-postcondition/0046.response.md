Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and subsequently, `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
