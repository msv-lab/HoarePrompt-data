Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, and `j` is equal to 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the condition `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the value of `dp[i][mask] + dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the execution.***
