Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and `j` is `n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to its current value and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, the values of `dp[i]`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
