The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` with `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` will be reduced by modulo `MOD`, but the specific values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not provided. Therefore, the output state retains the previous information about `dp`, and now `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the modulo operation.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where all elements in the first row (`dp[0]`) are set to 1, `j` is `n`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo with `MOD`.**
