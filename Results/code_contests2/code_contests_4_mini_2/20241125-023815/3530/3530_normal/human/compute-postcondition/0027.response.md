According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be equal to `n - 1` for the loop to have executed its last time, meaning that `j` is incremented to `n` in the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted to `n`, indicating that the loop has finished.

Additionally, since there are no other variables from the previous state that need to be adjusted, only the value of `j` needs to be updated.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where all elements in the first row (`dp[0]`) are set to 1, j is n**
