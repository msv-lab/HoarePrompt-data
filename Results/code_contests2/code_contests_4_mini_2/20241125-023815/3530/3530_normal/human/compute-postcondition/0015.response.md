The value of `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value of 1. Since `i` is 1, this means that `dp[0][1]` is set to 1. The value of `dp[0][0]` remains unchanged at 1. The other values in the `dp` list of lists are also unchanged and remain at 0. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, each having `1 << n` columns initialized to 0, `i` is 1, and `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, each having `1 << n` columns initialized to 0, `i` is 1, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1**
