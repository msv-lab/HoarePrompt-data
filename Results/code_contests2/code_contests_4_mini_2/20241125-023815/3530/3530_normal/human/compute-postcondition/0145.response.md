According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1. Additionally, since `j` changes within the loop, it must reflect the current value at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1**
