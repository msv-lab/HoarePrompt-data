According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute for `j` values from 0 to `n - 1`, meaning `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once. Additionally, before the loop starts, `j` should be initialized to 0 to reflect the starting point of the loop. 

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where all elements in the first row (`dp[0]`) are set to 1, mask is `mask + 1`, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
