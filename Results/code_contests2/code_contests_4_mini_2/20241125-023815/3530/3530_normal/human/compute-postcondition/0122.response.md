According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1. The value of `i` must be incremented for the next iteration. If `i` is `n`, then for the loop to execute again, `i` would need to be adjusted to `n + 1`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

No other states need to be adjusted as `dp` and `n` remain unchanged.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is unchanged**.
