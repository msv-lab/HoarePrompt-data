The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is modified by this operation. The other variables, including `dp`, `i`, `n`, and `mask`, remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1; `i` is `n + 1`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulus `MOD`.**
