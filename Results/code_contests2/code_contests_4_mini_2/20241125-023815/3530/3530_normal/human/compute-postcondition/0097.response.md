Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `mask` has reached the maximum value of `1 << n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to its current value, followed by taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
