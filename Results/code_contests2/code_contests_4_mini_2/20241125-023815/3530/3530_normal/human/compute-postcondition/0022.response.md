According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1, which has already been established in the initial state. The loop variable `j` will start at 0 and iterate until it is less than `n`. Since `i` is initialized to 1 and `mask` is set to 1, these values do not affect the loop execution directly.

To summarize, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 1, and at the start of the first iteration, `j` should be 0.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where all elements in the first row (`dp[0]`) are set to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0**
