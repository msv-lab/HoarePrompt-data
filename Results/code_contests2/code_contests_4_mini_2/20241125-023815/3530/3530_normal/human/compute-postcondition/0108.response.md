The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. This operation does not change the state of any other variables. Therefore, we describe the output state based on the previous values.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
