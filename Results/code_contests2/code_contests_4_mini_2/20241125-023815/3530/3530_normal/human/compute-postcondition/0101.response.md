Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, where all elements in `dp[0]` are set to 1, `n` is greater than 1, `mask` has reached the maximum value of `1 << n`, and `j` is equal to `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, and this value is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
