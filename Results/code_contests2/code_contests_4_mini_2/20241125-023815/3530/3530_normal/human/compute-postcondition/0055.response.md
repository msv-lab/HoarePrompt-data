Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0. The element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true, indicating that the j-th bit of `mask` is set.***
