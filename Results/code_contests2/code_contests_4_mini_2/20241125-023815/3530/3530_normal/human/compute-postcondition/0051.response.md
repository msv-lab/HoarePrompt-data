According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from `0` to `n - 1`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `j` would be `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased to `n`, which will cause the loop condition to fail.

In this case, no other states need to be adjusted since the list `dp` is already defined to have `n + 1` rows, and the previous iteration has already processed the conditions for updating `dp[i][mask]`. 

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `j` is `n`**
