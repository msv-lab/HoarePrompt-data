According to the code, the loop executes for `i` ranging from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. Since the loop condition is `i < n + 1`, the loop cannot execute again with `i` being `n + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be 1, the starting value of the loop. The variable `mask` remains unchanged as it can take any value from `1` to `2^n - 1`, depending on the previous iterations. The list `dp` is not modified in this context since it retains its structure and values from the previous iteration where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is 1, `mask` ranges from 1 to `2^n - 1`**
