According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `n`, which means it will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which means the loop has already completed its iterations for `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` would need to be equal to `n`, which is not in the current state since `j` must be less than `n`. Additionally, `i` remains at `n + 1`, and there are no other states that need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1; `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1.**
