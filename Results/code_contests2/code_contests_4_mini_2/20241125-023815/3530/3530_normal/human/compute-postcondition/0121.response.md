Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `2^n - 1` times, with `mask` ranging from 1 to `1 << n - 1` (non-inclusive). For each value of `mask`, the inner loop will execute `n` times for `j` from 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged with all elements in `dp[0]` set to 1. Additionally, if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 0 for all `j` or if `mask` does not match any valid combination of `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` will remain unchanged for that `mask`.**
