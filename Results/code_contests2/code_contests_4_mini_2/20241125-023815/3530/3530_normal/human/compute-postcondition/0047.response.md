According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` in the range from `0` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `j` would have reached its maximum value of `n - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`. Thus, the current value of `j` should be updated to `n`, and there are no other states that need to be adjusted since the loop condition only depends on `j`.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `j` is `n`**
