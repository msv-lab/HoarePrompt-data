According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented, which means it must be adjusted to `n + 1`. Since the loop is dependent on `j` being less than `n`, it cannot execute again under the current state. Therefore, `j` must be adjusted to `n + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where all elements in the first row (`dp[0]`) are set to 1, `j` is `n + 1`**
