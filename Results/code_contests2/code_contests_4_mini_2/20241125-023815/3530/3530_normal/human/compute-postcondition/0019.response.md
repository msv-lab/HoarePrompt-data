Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, each having `1 << n` columns, where all elements in the first row (`dp[0]`) are set to 1, and `i` varies from 0 to `2^n - 1`. If `n` is less than 0, the loop does not execute and `dp` remains a list of lists with all elements initialized to 0.**
