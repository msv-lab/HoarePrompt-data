Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `n` is greater than 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
