The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is affected by this operation, but the exact value is not specified in the initial state. The other variables `i`, `mask`, `n`, and `j` are not directly changed by this operation.

Since `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1, the output state will indicate that `dp[i][mask]` has been modified, but the exact new value cannot be determined without knowing the initial value of `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo `MOD`, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
