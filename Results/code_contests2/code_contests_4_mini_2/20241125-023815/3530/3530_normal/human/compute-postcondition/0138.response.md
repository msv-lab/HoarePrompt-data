Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and `mask` is 1. The loop will execute `n` times, iterating over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo `MOD`. If either condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, leaving `dp` unchanged and retaining the initial state where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1.**
