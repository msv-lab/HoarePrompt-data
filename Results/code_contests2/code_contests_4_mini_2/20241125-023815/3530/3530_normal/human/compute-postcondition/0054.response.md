According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute for `j` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. The state of `dp` suggests it is properly initialized with `n + 1` rows and `dp[0]` set to all elements being 1, which is appropriate for the loop's functionality. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 1, and the variable `j` should start at 0. 

State: **`dp` remains a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0**
