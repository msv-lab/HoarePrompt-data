Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
