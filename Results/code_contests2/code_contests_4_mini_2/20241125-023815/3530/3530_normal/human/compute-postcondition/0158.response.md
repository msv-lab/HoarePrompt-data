The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Here, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 0, which means `1 << j` is 1. Therefore, `mask ^ 1 << j` results in `3 ^ 1`, which equals 2. The element `dp[i - 1][2]` is added to `dp[i][3]`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dp` is updated, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 0, and `dp[i][3]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][2]`.**
