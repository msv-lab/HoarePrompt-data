The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it. The `mask` has the j-th bit set to 1, meaning the operation `mask ^ (1 << j)` will toggle the j-th bit of `mask`. Since `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the operation affects the `dp` array, updating the current state based on previous states.

Given that `dp` is a list of lists initialized with `n + 1` rows and `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, this indicates that the values of `dp` are being utilized in a way that builds upon previous calculations.

Therefore, we can conclude that `dp[i][mask]` is incremented based on the previous state `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. Since the specific values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided, but we know `mask` has reached its maximum value and `j` is 0, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it, where `mask` has j-th bit set to 1, and `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1.**
