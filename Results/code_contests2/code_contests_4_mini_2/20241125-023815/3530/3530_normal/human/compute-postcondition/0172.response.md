Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and `mask` ranges from 1 to `2^n - 1`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes `2^n - 1` times, iterating over `j` from 0 to `n - 1` for each `mask`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` modulo `MOD`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, leaving `dp` unchanged with `dp[0]` still containing all elements set to 1. If for a specific `mask`, `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or `mask & (1 << j)` is false for all `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
