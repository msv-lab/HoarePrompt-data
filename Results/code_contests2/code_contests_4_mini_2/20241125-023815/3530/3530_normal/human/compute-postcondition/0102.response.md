According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `n`. Since `j` is currently equal to `n`, the loop will not execute again because the range goes from `0` to `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted to be less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`, so to allow the loop to run again, we need to set `j` to `0`. The other states do not need to be adjusted as they are not directly affected by the loop's execution.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, where all elements in `dp[0]` are set to 1, `n` is greater than 1, `mask` has reached the maximum value of `1 << n`, and `j` is 0**
