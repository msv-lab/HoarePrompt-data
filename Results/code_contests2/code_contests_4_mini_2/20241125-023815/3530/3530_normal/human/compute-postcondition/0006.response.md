The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` appends a new row to the 2D list `a`. The new row consists of integers that are obtained by splitting the input string. Since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, and `a` is a 2D list, the previous state of `a` will remain unchanged except for the addition of this new row. The exact values of the new row depend on the user input, which is currently unknown. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `N` and `MOD`, the greater than 1 condition for `n`, and the new row being added to `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a 2D list with an appended row of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 1**
