According to the code, the for loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the current value of `i` in the loop, and since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

1. Since the loop is structured to run from `1` to `n + 1`, the next iteration will occur when `i` is incremented by 1.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented, which means the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`.
3. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, we need to set `i` to the next value for the next iteration of the loop. 

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is 2, `n` is unchanged**
