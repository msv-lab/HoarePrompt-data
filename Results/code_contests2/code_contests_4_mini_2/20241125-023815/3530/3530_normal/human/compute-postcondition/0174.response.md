Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows. If `n` is greater than 0, `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `dp[i][mask]` may be updated based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and the j-th bit of `mask`. Specifically, if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated as `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` modulo `MOD`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged with all elements in `dp[0]` still set to 1. Additionally, if `a[i - 1][j]` is 0 for all `j` or if `mask` does not match any valid combination of `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` will also remain unchanged for that `mask`.**
