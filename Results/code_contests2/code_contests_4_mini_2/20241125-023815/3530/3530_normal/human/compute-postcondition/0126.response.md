The code updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. Given the state where `dp` is a list of lists, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, and `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, we evaluate as follows:

1. `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0, so `1 << j` equals `1`. 
2. Therefore, `mask ^ 1 << j` computes to `1 ^ 1`, which results in `0`.
3. As a result, the expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][0]` will add the value of `dp[i - 1][0]` to `dp[i][1]`.

The specific previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][0]` are unknown, but we note that `dp[i][mask]` is modified.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` to it, where `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, and the prior value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][0]`.**
