Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation of `mask` with `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and this updated value is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
