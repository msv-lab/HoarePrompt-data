According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, and `j` is `n`. Since `j` is equal to `n`, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted to `n` and we need to ensure `n` remains at least 1.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.
