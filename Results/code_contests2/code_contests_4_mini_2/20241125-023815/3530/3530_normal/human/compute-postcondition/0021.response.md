According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mask` and the condition defined in the `range`. The loop will execute if `mask` iterates from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (i.e., it will run as long as \(n\) is at least 1). Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute, starting from `mask = 1`.

At the beginning of the for loop, `i` is set to 1, and the first iteration will set `mask` to 1 as well. The loop will execute for values of `mask` up to \(2^n - 1\), so with `n` being at least 1, the preconditions are satisfied.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where all elements in the first row (`dp[0]`) are set to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1**
