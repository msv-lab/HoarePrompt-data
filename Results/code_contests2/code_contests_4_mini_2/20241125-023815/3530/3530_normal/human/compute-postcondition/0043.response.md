According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have `j` at its current value, which is less than `n` (since the loop has been executing). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Thus, if `j` was `n - 1` at the end of the last iteration, it should be adjusted to `n`, which would mean that the loop will not execute again. Therefore, `j` must be adjusted to `n - 1` to ensure that `j` is less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `j` is `n - 1`**
