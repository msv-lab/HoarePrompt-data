The value of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`, which will update `dp[i][mask]` to be within the range defined by `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are affected by this operation, but the specific previous value is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` is now constrained by the modulo operation. 

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
