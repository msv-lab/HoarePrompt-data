Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where all elements in the first row (`dp[0]`) are set to 1 and `j` is `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and this value is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition does not hold, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
