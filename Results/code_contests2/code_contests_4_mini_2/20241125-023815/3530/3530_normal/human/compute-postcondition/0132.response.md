Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1; `i` is `n + 1`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and subsequently taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
