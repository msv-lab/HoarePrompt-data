The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of the division of `dp[i][mask]` by `MOD`. This means that the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is reduced to its remainder when divided by `MOD`. Other variables (`dp`, `j`, and `mask`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state remains reflective of the current values of the variables, including the update made to `dp[i][mask]`. 

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and `dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.**
