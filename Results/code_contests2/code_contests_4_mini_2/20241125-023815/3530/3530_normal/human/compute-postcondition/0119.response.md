Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `mask` is 1. The loop will execute `n` times for `j` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it and taking modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the condition for the bitwise AND is not satisfied, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop will not execute, and `dp` will remain unchanged from its initial state.**
