According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1. The condition on `n` does not need to be changed because it still satisfies `j < n` after the modification.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `n` is greater than 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1**
