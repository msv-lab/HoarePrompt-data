Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1. After the loop executes, for each valid `mask` from 1 to `2^n - 1`, `dp[i][mask]` may be updated based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and the j-th bit of `mask`. If for any `j`, `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated as `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. If these conditions are not met for all `j` values in a given iteration, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged with `dp[0]` still filled with 1s. Additionally, if there are no valid `j` indices such that `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 for a given `mask`, then `dp[i][mask]` will also remain unchanged.**
