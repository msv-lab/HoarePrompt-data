Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `mask` has reached the maximum value of `1 << n - 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. The loop executes `n` times if `n` is greater than 0; if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `dp` remains unchanged.**
