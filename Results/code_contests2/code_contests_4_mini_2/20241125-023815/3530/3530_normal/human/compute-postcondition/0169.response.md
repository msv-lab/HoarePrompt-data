According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased to 3. Additionally, since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it should be adjusted to `n` being greater than or equal to 3 to ensure the loop can execute again, as `j` will become 3.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 3.**
