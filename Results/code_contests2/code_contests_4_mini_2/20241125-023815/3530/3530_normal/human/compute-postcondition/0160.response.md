Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
