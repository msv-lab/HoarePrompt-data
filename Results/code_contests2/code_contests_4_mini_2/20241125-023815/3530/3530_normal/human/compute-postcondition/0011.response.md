The code initializes `dp` as a list of lists (2D list) where each sublist has a length of `1 << n`. The outer list has `n + 1` sublists. The value `1 << n` is equivalent to \(2^n\), which indicates that the width of each sublist is determined by the number of rows `n`. If `n` is 0, this results in `dp` being a list with one sublist containing one element, which is 0. If `n` is positive, each sublist has \(2^n\) elements, all initialized to 0. 

Thus, the output state reflects the dimensions and initial values of `dp` based on the current value of `n`.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, each having `1 << n` (or \(2^n\)) columns, all initialized to 0.**
