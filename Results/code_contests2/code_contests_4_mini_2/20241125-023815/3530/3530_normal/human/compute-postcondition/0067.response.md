According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3. Thus, we need to adjust `j` to reflect this increment.

Since `n` remains unchanged, it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` remains a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `j` is 3**
