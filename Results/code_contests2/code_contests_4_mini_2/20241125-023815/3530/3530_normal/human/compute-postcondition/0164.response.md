Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` includes the j-th bit (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
