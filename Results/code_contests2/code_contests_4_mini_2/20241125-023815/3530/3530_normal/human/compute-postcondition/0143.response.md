The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This operation ensures that `dp[i][mask]` retains a value within the bounds defined by `MOD`. Other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by the modulo operation with `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by the modulo operation with `MOD**`
