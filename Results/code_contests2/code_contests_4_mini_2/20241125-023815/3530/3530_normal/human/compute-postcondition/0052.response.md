Output State: **`dp` remains a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 0 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. The loop does not execute if `n` is 0 or if there are no valid `j` indices such that `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, resulting in no updates to `dp[i][mask]` in such cases.**
