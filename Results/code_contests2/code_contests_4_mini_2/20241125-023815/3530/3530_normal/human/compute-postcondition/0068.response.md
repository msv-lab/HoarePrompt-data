Output State: **`dp` remains a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1. After the loop executes, if `n` is at least 1, `j` will take values from 0 to `n-1`. If for any `j`, `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set (`mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] + dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. If these conditions are not satisfied for all iterations of `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged, with all elements of `dp[0]` still set to 1.**
