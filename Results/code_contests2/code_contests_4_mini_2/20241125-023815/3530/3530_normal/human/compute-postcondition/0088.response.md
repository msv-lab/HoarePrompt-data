According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over `mask` from 1 to `2^n - 1` (which corresponds to the range `1 << n`), meaning that for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` must be adjusted to the next value in the sequence.

At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is at its maximum value of `1 << n - 1` (which is equal to `2^n - 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, it cannot, because it has already reached the upper limit of the range defined by `1 << n`.

Therefore, the state needs to reflect that the loop cannot continue executing because the maximum value of `mask` has been reached.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` has reached the maximum value of `1 << n - 1`**
