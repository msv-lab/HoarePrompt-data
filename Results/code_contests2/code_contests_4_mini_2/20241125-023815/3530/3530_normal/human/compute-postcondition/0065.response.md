The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. This operation modifies `dp[i][mask]`, but does not affect the values of `j` or `n`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are unknown, but they will now be constrained within the range of `0` to `MOD - 1` after this operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `j` is 2, `n` is unchanged**
