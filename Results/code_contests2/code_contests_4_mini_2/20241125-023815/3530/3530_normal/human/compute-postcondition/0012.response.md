According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `1 << n`, which equals \(2^n\). For the loop to execute, `n` must be non-negative, since a negative value would not allow the computation of \(2^n\) and thus would result in an empty range. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take values starting from 0 up to \(2^n - 1\). Therefore, before the loop begins, `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting point of the range.

To summarize, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is non-negative and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, each having `1 << n` columns initialized to 0, `i` is 0, `n` is non-negative**
