Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists with `n + 1` rows where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and `dp[i][mask]` is then assigned the value `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. This ensures that valid transitions are accounted for based on the specified conditions while maintaining the modulus constraint.***
