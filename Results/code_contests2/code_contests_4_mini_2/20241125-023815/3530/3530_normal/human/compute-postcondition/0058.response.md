Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a list of lists with `n + 1` rows, where `dp[0]` contains all elements set to 1, `j` is 0, and if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] + dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. If these conditions are not satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
