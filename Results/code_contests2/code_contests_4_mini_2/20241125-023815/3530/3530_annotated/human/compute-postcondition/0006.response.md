The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and appends the resulting map (which is an iterator) to the list `a`. The variable `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, which indicates that `a` should eventually have a number of integers that is consistent with this range. The variable `n` is greater than 1 and is not directly affected by this operation. 

However, since we are appending the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to the list `a`, which is initially unspecified but is assumed to be empty, `a` will now contain a new list of integers based on the user input.

Since the exact content of the input is unknown, we cannot determine the final contents of `a`, but we can conclude that `a` is modified to include new integers from the input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` includes new integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 1**
