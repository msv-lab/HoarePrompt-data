The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` would be updated based on its relation to `dp[i - 1][3]`, but the specific values are not provided. Therefore, the effect is that `dp[i][mask]` is reduced to its remainder when divided by `MOD`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][3]` and now is `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
