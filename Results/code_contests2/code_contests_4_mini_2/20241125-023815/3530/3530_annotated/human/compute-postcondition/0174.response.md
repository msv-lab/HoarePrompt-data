Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]` being equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` being set, with contributions taken from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, modulo `MOD`. The loop will execute for all `i` from 1 to `n`, and for each `mask` from 1 to `2^n - 1`, provided that there are sufficient entries in `a`. If `n` is 0 or not greater than 0, or if `a` has fewer than `i` entries, or if all entries in `a[i - 1]` are 0, then the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged from its initialized state. In cases where `mask` has no bits set or if `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute and `dp[i][mask]` remains as initialized.**
