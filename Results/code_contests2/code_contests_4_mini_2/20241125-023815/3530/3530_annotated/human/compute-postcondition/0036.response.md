Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions set by `a[i - 1][j]` and the j-th bit of `mask`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is the sum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, taken modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. The loop will execute `n` times if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains as initialized.**
