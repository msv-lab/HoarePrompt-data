The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It utilizes a positive integer `N` within the constraints of 1 <= N <= 21, which determines the size of the 2D list `a`. The list `a` consists of integers where each element `a[i][j]` is either 0 or 1, representing the compatibility between man `i` and woman `j`. The function processes this information and produces a result based on the compatibility data.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It processes a 2D list of integers representing compatibility and returns a result based on the compatibility between men and women.**
