The statement modifies the `dp` array, specifically the element at index `[i][mask]`, by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The specific values of `dp` are not provided, but we know that `mask` is `1`, and `j` is `2`. The operation `1 << j` results in `4` (since `1 << 2` shifts the binary representation of `1` two places to the left). Thus, the expression `mask ^ 1 << j` will yield `1 ^ 4`, which is `5`.

Since `n` is at least `3`, `i` can take values starting from `0` to at least `n`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by adding `dp[i - 1][5]`, but the actual previous values of `dp` are unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the general effect of the operation rather than specific values.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `mask` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][5]`**
