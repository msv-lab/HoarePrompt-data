The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variables `i`, `mask`, `n`, and `j` are provided with specific relationships, but the state of `dp` is not given. 

1. `i` is `n + 1`, which is at least `3` since `n` is greater than `1`.
2. `mask` is `2` (which in binary is `10`).
3. `j` is `2`, so `1 << j` is `4` (which in binary is `100`).
4. The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` computes the XOR between `mask` and `4`, resulting in `2 ^ 4 = 6` (which in binary is `110`).

Thus, the line of code effectively modifies `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][6]`.

The output state would summarize the known values and the operation performed:

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, `n` is greater than `1`, `j` is `2`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][6]`.**
