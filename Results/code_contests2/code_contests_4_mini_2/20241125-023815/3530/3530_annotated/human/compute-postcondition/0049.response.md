The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This operation affects the value of `dp[i][mask]`, ensuring that it remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The previous values of other variables remain unaffected by this specific operation. Therefore, the output state is that `dp[i][mask]` is updated with a modulo operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`**
