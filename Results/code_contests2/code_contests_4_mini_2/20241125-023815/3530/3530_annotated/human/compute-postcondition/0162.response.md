The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `mask` is currently 1, and `j` is 1, so we calculate `mask ^ 1 << j`.

Calculating `1 << j` where `j` is 1 gives us `2` (since `1 << 1` shifts the binary representation of 1 one place to the left, resulting in `10` in binary, which is `2` in decimal). Then, we calculate `mask ^ 2`, which is `1 ^ 2`. The binary representation of `1` is `01` and `2` is `10`, so performing the XOR operation yields `3` (which is `11` in binary).

Now, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated with the value of `dp[i - 1][3]`, but we don't have information about the values in the `dp` array. The values of `n`, `j`, and `mask` are unaffected by this operation, therefore we note that the impact is on the `dp` array.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `mask` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][3]`**.
