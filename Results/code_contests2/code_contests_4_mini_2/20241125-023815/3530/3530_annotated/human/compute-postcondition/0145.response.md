According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, `n` is greater than `0`, and `j` is `0`. Since `j` is currently `0`, it can execute again for `j = 1` in the next iteration, provided that `n` is at least `2`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be adjusted to `1`. The value of `n` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute with `j = 1`. 

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is `1`**
