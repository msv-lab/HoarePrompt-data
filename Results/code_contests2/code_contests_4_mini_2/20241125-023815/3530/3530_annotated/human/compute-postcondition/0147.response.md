The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The previous values are not specified for `dp[i][mask]`, but the operation ensures that `dp[i][mask]` will be within the range of `0` to `MOD-1` after execution. Other variables (`i`, `mask`, `n`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the condition that `n` is greater than 1, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `1`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
