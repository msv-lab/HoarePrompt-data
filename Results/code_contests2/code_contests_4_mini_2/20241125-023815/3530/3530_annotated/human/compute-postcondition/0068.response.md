Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]` and the j-th bit of `mask`. After the loop, if `n` is greater than 0 and there are at least `n` entries in `a`, `j` will take values from 0 to `n-1`, and `mask` will be incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` will include contributions from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. If `n` is 0 or `a` has fewer than `n` entries, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
