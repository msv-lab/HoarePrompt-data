According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its last value, which is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`, at which point the loop will terminate as the condition `j < n` will no longer hold. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `j` has reached `n`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the other variables involved in the loop body (`dp`, `mask`, and `a`) do not change due to the loop's iteration.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value of `a[i - 1][j]`, `j` is `n`**
