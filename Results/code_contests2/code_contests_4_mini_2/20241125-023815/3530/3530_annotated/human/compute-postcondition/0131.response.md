The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The values of `i`, `mask`, `j`, and `dp[i - 1][3]` are not directly affected by this operation, but the operation modifies the state of `dp[i][mask]`. Therefore, we retain the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `1`, `j` is `1`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its value modulo `MOD`**
