Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]`. If `n` is greater than 0 and the loop executes, `dp[i][mask]` will accumulate values from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for each `j` where `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the corresponding bit in `mask` is set. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. Additionally, if no `j` meets the criteria (i.e., if `a[i - 1][j]` is never 1 or the corresponding bits of `mask` are never set), `dp[i][mask]` will also remain unchanged.**
