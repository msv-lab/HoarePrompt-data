According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is at least 3, which allows for one more iteration of the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `j` to 3, as the next value of `j` is what will be used in the following iteration. The value of `mask` does not need to be adjusted since it will remain the same through this iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `mask` is 1**
