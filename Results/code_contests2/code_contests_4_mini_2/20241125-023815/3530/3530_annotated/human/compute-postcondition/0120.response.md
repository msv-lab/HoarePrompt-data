According to the code, the loop iterates over `mask` from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `mask` at the start of the next iteration needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than \(2^n\). 

At the end of the last iteration, the current state of `mask` is not specified, but we know that for the loop to have executed at least once, it must have started from a value of 1 or greater. Therefore, to ensure the loop can run one more time, we need to adjust `mask` to be the next integer value, which would be `mask + 1`.

Given that `n` is greater than 0, if the loop has executed, `mask` must be less than \(2^n\). Thus, we can say that `mask` can be adjusted accordingly to be the next value in the range.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]`, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is adjusted to the next value in the range (i.e., `mask` is one more than the last used value)**
