Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `mask` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
