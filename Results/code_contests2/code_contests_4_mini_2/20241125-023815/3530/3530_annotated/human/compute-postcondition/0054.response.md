According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Additionally, before the loop starts, the variable `j` needs to be initialized to 0, as it will be used as the loop index. The state of `dp[i][mask]` is already updated based on the previous conditions, and `mask` is incremented by 1 as stated. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and that `j` starts at 0.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions of `a[i - 1][j]` and the j-th bit of `mask`, `mask` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
