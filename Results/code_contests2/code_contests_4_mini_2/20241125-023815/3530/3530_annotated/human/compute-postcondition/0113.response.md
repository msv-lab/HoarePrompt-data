Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]`, where if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` contains the bit corresponding to `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`, ensuring that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the range of 0 to `MOD - 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or the bit corresponding to `j` is not set in `mask`, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
