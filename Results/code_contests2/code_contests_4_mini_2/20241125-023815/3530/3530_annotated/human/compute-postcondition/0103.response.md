Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true), then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and subsequently taken modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. The loop will execute `n` times if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged from its initial state.**
