According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `n`. The loop variable `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have been equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be incremented to `n`.

Since the loop variable `j` is incremented within the loop, to allow the loop to run one more time, `j` should be set to `n`, which means in the next iteration the loop will not execute because `j` will equal `n`, exceeding the range defined by `range(n)`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `j` needs to be adjusted to `n`.

No other states need to be adjusted since the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

State: **`dp[0]` is a list of length `(1 << n)` with all elements initialized to 1, j is n**
