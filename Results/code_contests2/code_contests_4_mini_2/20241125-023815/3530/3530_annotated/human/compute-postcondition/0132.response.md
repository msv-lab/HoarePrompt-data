Postcondition: ***Given that `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is `1`, if the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` holds true and `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and this result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition does not hold, the value of `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
