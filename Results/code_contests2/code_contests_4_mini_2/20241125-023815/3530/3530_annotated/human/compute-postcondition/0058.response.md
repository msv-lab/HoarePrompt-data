Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `mask` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
