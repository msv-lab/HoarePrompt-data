The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is unknown, but we can infer that the operation will ensure that `dp[i][mask]` is within the range of 0 to `MOD - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect this update.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be within the range of 0 to `MOD - 1`**
