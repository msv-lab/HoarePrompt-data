The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, and `j` is `0`, we need to evaluate the expression step by step.

1. `mask` is `2`, which in binary is `10`.
2. `1 << j` where `j` is `0` results in `1`, which in binary is `01`.
3. The bitwise XOR operation `mask ^ (1 << j)` becomes `2 ^ 1`, which results in `1` (`10 ^ 01 = 01`).
4. Therefore, the code accesses `dp[i - 1][1]` and adds this value to `dp[i][2]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. As such, the output state captures the relevant information.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `0`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][1]`.**
