Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `1`, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is `2`, and if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be equal to `(dp[i][mask] + dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]) % MOD`. If the condition is not satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
