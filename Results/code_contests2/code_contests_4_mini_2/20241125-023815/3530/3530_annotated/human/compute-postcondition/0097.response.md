Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition that if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, followed by taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
