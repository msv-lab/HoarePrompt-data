The code modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The variables affected are `i`, `mask`, and the 2D list `dp`. 

Given that `i` is `n + 1` and `mask` is `2`, and knowing that `j` is `1`, we can calculate `mask ^ 1 << j`. 

The calculation for `1 << j` when `j` is `1` gives `2`, so `mask ^ 1 << j` is `2 ^ 2`, which equals `0`. 

Thus, the operation becomes:
```
dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][0]
```

The output state will reflect the unchanged nature of `n`, `mask`, `j`, and will indicate that the value of `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the value from `dp[i - 1][0]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `1`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]`**.
