The code updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The values of `dp[i][mask]` are affected, while `a[i - 1][j]`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, nor is the result of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, so we can only indicate that an update occurs.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, `a[i - 1][j]` is unchanged, `j` is now `j + 1`, and `n` is unchanged**.
