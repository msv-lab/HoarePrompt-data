Output State: **`dp[0]` is a list of length `(1 << n)` where each index from 0 to `(1 << n) - 1` is set to 1. If `n` is 0 or not greater than 0, the loop does not execute and `dp` remains unchanged (the initial state of `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where each element is a list of `(1 << n)` zeros).**
