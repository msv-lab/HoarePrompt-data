Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions set by `a[i - 1][j]` and the j-th bit of `mask`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set (mask & 1 << j), then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. This ensures that the updates to `dp[i][mask]` correctly reflect the state of the previous computations based on the provided conditions.***
