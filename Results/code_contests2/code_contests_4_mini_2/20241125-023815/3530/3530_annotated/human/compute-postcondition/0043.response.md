According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `j` is currently at its last value before the next iteration, which is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`, and thus the loop cannot execute again as `j` would not satisfy the condition of being less than `n`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions set by `a[i - 1][j]` and the j-th bit of `mask`, j is `n`**
