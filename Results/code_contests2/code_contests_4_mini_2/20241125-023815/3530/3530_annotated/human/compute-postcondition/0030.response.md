Postcondition: ***`dp[0]` is a list of length `(1 << n)` with all elements initialized to 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and applying modulo `MOD`. Consequently, `dp[i][mask]` retains its previous value unless the conditions are met, in which case it reflects the updated sum based on the previous row and modified mask.***
