Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]` and the bitwise operation with `mask`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
