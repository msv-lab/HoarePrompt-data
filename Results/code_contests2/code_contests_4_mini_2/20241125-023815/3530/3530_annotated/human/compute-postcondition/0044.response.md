The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The specific values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` depend on their previous states. The variable `mask` is altered by the bitwise operation `mask ^ 1 << j`, which flips the j-th bit of `mask`. The states of other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous state and the operation with `mask`, resulting in `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**.
