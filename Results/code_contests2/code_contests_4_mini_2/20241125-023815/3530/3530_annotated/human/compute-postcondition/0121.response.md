Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` accumulates sums based on the condition that `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop executes for all values of `mask` from 1 to `2^n - 1`, updating `dp[i][mask]` accordingly. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged from its initial state. Additionally, if there are no valid `j` indices where `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 or if none of the bits in `mask` are set, `dp[i][mask]` will remain unchanged after the loop executes.**
