According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which ranges from 0 to `n - 1`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state includes the information about `j`. However, since we don't have the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only infer that `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to be the next value in the range.

If `j` is currently at `n - 1`, the loop will not execute again, as `j` cannot be equal to `n`. We need to set `j` to `n` to indicate the completion of the loop.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we should set `j` to `0` (next value after the last valid iteration).

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition that `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, j is 0, n is greater than 0**
