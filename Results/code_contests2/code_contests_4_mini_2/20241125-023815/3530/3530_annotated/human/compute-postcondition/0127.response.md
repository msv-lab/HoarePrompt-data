The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` to be the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`. The value of `mask` is `1`, so this affects `dp[i][1]`. The previous value of `dp[i][1]` is `dp[i - 1][0]`, which was previously set. The state of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and `MOD`) does not change because this operation only modifies the `dp` array.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `0`, and `dp[i][1]` is updated to `dp[i][1] % MOD`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `0`, and `dp[i][1]` is updated to `dp[i][1] % MOD**
