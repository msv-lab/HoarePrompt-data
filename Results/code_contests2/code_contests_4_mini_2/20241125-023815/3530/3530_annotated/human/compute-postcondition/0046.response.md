Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition that `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set. If this condition holds true, `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition does not hold, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
