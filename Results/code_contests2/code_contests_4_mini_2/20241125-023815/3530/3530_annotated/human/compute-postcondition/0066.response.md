Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `mask` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the sum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and finally, `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, the values of `dp[i][mask]` remain unchanged.***
