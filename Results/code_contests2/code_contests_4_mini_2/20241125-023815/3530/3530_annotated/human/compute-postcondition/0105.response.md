According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]`, we also need to ensure that the variable `j` is initialized correctly for the first iteration. In this case, `j` should start at 0.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]`, `mask` is k + 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
