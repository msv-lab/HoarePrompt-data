Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i][j]`, where `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` with `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and this result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
