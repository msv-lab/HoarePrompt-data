The code snippet `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits the input string into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and appends the resulting list of integers to `a`. The other variables (`N`, `MOD`, and `n`) remain unchanged, and since `a` is being modified by appending new integers, we do not know the previous state or contents of `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 2, and new integers have been appended to `a` from input.**
