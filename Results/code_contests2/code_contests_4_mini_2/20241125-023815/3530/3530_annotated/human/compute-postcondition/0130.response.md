The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variables `i`, `mask`, and `j` are known, where `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `1`, and `j` is `1`. The value of `mask ^ 1 << j` calculates to `1 ^ 2`, which results in `3`. Therefore, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous state from `dp[i - 1][3]`. 

The other variables do not change, and since the specific values of `dp` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numeric outputs of `dp[i][mask]` or `dp[i - 1][3]`. Thus, the output state reflects the relationships and calculations made.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `1`, `j` is `1`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][3]`**
