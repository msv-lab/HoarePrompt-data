According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range of `n`, meaning it can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `j` will become 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, it allows for at least one more iteration. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are to set `j` to 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `mask` is 1**
