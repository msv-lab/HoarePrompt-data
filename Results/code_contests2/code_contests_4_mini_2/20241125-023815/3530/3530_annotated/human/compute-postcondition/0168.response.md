Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `mask` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`. If the condition is not satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
