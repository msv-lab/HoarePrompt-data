Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` accumulates sums based on valid conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and the j-th bit of `mask`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute for `mask` values from `1` to `2^n - 1`. After execution, `dp[i][mask]` may be updated based on the conditions met during iterations; specifically, it adds values from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for valid `j`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If all conditions are not satisfied for any `j`, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
