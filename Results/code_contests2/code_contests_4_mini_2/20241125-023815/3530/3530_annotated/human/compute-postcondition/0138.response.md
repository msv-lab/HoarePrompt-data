Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is in the range of `0` to `n-1`. After the loop executes, `dp[i][mask]` may be updated based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask`. If `n` is 0 or less than 0, the loop will not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` will remain unchanged. If `n` is greater than 0, `dp[i][mask]` will contain the accumulated values based on the valid conditions met during each iteration.**
