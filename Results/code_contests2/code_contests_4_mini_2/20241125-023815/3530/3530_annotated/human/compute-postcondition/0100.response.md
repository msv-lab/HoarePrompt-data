The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This ensures that the value of `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are not specified, but they will be altered by this operation. Other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
