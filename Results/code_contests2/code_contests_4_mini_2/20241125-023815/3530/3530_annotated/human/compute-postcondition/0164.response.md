Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `mask` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND (1 left shifted by `j`) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask XOR (1 left shifted by j)]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
