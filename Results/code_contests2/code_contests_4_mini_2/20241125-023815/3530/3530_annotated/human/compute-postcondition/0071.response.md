According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute for `i` from 1 to `n`, so the next value for `i` should be `i + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value between 1 and `n`, and since the loop can execute if `i` is less than or equal to `n`, we need to adjust `i` to `i + 1`. 

To ensure the loop executes again, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`. The updated state should reflect this, while all other states remain unchanged.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i][j]`, `i` is now less than or equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`**
