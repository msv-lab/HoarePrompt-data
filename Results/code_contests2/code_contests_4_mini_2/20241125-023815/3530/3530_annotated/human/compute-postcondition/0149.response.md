According to the code, the loop iterates based on the value of `j`, which ranges from `0` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `1`, and `n` is greater than `1`, which means the loop can execute one more time if `j` is incremented to `2`. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` would need to be adjusted to `2`. There are no other states that need to be adjusted, as `n` being greater than `1` is sufficient for another iteration and the other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, `n` is greater than `1`, and `j` is `2`**
