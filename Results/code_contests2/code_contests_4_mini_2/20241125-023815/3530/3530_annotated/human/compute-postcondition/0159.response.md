The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and computing the remainder when divided by `MOD`. The initial state mentions that `dp[i][mask]` has been updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` to it, but the specific value of `dp[i][mask]` is not provided. The other variables `n`, `j`, and `mask` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is based on the information given.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `mask` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`.**
