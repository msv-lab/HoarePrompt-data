According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Since it is stated that `n` is greater than 0, the loop can indeed execute. At the start of the loop, the variable `j` needs to be initialized to 0, which is the first index for the range defined by `n`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `mask` is k + 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
