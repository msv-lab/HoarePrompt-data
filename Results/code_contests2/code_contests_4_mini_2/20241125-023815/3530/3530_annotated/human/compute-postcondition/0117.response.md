Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value of `a[i - 1][j]`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met (i.e., if `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the corresponding bit in `mask` is not set), `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. This ensures that the update only occurs when both conditions are satisfied, maintaining the integrity of the DP table.***
