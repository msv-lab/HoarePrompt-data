The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` with the remainder when divided by `MOD`. This means that `dp[i][mask]` retains the same value if it is less than `MOD` and becomes the value of `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD` if it is greater than or equal to `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` affects the output, but other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`**
