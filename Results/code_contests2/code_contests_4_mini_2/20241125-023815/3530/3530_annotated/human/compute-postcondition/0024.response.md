The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modifies the value at `dp[i][mask]`. The current values are as follows: `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0. The bitwise operation `1 << j` results in 1, thus `mask ^ 1 << j` equals `1 ^ 1`, which is 0. 

Since `dp[0]` is initialized such that each index is set to 1, it follows that `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` translates to `dp[0][0]`, which is 1. Therefore, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by 1, changing its value from its previous state.

The output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` and confirms the unchanged state of the other variables. 

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, and `a[i - 1][j]` is 1**
