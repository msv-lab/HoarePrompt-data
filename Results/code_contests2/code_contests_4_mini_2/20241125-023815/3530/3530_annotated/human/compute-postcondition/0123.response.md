According to the code, the for loop iterates over `mask` from 1 to `1 << n` (which is 2 raised to the power of n). This means that for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1; otherwise, the range will be empty (since 1 to 1 is not a valid range). 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, and `mask` should start at 1. The condition for `dp[i][mask]` to accumulate sums relies on the previous states of `i` and `mask`, specifically that the appropriate `a[i - 1][j]` values are set based on the condition with respect to `mask`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `n` needs to be greater than 0, `mask` will start at 1, and `i` is already `n + 1`.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
