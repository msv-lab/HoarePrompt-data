According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 0 to `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its maximum value of `n-1`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`, which means it can no longer satisfy the loop condition. 

As such, the state that needs to be adjusted is related to `j`. There are no other states mentioned that require modification since the existing condition will not allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition that if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, followed by taking the result modulo `MOD`, and `j` is n**
