According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` becoming 2, and `n` must be at least 3 (since `j` now needs to be less than `n`).

State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 2, and `mask` is 1**
