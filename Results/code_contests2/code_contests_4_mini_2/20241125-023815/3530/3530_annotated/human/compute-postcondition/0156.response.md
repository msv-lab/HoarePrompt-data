According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The condition `n` is greater than 0 ensures that the loop will indeed execute at least once. The loop variable `j` will start from 0 and increment with each iteration. Since `mask` is already set to 1 (the starting value for the next iteration), it indicates that the first iteration has not yet occurred. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `j` is initialized to 0, and `mask` is appropriately set for the next iteration after the first iteration completes. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `mask` is 1**
