Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask` is `k + 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bit corresponding to `j` in `mask` is set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and subsequently taken modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the bit corresponding to `j` in `mask` is not set, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. Additionally, edge cases where `i` or `mask` may be at their boundary values have been considered in this logic.***
