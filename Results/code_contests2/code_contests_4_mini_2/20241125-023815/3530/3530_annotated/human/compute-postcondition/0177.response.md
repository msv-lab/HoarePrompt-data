Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` from input, followed by `n` lines of input containing integers. It constructs a 2D list `a` based on this input, where each sublist corresponds to the integers from each line. The function then initializes a dynamic programming table `dp` to compute a result based on the compatibility information in `a`, specifically, it calculates the number of ways to select a subset of items defined by `mask`, considering the conditions in `a`. Finally, it prints the result stored in `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]`, which represents a specific computed value based on the compatibility between the items. If `n` is 0 or negative, the function will not process any input and will output `1`, as `dp[0][0]` is initialized to `1`.**
