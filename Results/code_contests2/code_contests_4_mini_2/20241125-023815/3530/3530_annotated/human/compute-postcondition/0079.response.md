The expression updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. We know that `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1. The operation involves the bitwise XOR of `mask` (which is 1) and `1 << j` (which is 2, since `j` is 1).

Calculating `mask ^ 1 << j` gives us `1 ^ 2`, resulting in `3`. Therefore, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][3]` to its current value.

However, without knowing the specific values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][3]`, we can only describe the change in terms of variables and not specific values.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i - 1][3]`**
