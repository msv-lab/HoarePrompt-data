The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. This means the current value of `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value found at `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is modified. The state of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is dependent on previous computations and is not explicitly provided either.

Therefore, the output state reflects the update to `dp[i][mask]` without specifying its previous value. The output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
