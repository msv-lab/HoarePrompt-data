According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and its relationship with `n`. The loop iterates over `j` in the range of `n`, meaning it will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2. However, we also need to ensure that `j` remains less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `mask` has been incremented by 1.**
