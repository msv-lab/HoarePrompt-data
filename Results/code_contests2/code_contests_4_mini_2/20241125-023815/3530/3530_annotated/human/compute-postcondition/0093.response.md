Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bit corresponding to `j` is set in `mask`, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and subsequently taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
