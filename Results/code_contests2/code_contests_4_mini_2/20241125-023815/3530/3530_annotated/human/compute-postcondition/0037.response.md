According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (i.e., `1 << n`), meaning it will execute as long as `mask` is in that range. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is currently at some value less than \(2^n\). 

To execute one more time, `mask` needs to be incremented by 1, which will require it to be less than \(2^n - 1\) in the preceding state. If `mask` is currently at its maximum value of \(2^n - 1\) (which is when the loop would stop executing), it cannot increment further. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` must be adjusted to be less than \(2^n\).

Since the loop iterates from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), we need to ensure that `mask` is less than \(2^n\) and we need to increment `mask` to the next value.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions set by `a[i - 1][j]` and the j-th bit of `mask`, `mask` is less than (1 << n)**
