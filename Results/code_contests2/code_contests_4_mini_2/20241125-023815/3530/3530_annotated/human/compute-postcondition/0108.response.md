The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is retained but modified to ensure it falls within the range defined by `MOD`. The other variables such as `mask`, `n`, `j`, and `a[i - 1][j]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulus operation, `mask` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `a[i - 1][j]` is 1.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulus operation, `mask` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `a[i - 1][j]` is 1**.
