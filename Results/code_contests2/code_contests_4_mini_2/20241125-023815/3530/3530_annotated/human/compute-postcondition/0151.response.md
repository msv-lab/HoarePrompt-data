The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` to be the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`. The previous state indicates that `dp[i][mask]` has already been updated by adding `dp[i - 1][6]`, but the exact value of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` is not specified. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific value of `dp[i][mask]` after the modulo operation, but we know that it is now the result of that operation. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, `n` is greater than `1`, `j` is `2`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
