Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, `n` is greater than `1`, and `j` is `2`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` added to its current value, and this result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
