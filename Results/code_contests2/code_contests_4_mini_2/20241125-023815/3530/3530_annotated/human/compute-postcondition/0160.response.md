Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `mask` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, followed by taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
