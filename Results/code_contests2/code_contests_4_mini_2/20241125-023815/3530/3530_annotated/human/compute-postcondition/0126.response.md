The code `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

In the initial state:
- `i` is `n + 1`, 
- `mask` is `1`, 
- `n` is greater than `0`, 
- `j` is `0`, 
- the value at `a[i - 1][j]` is `1`, 
- and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero.

Since `mask` is `1` and `j` is `0`, we have `1 << j` equal to `1`. Therefore, `mask ^ 1 << j` results in `1 ^ 1`, which equals `0`. 

The operation `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][0]` indicates that we are adding the value of `dp[i - 1][0]` to `dp[i][1]`. 

This changes the state of `dp[i][1]`, but does not affect other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `1`, `n` is greater than `0`, `j` is `0`, and `dp[i][1]` is updated with the value of `dp[i - 1][0]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `0`, and `dp[i][1]` is updated with the value of `dp[i - 1][0]**
