According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented to 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `mask` has been incremented by 1.**
