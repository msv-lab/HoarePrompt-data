The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. Given that `mask` is 1 and `j` is 0, the bitwise operation `mask ^ 1 << j` results in `1 ^ 1`, which equals 0. Therefore, the value added to `dp[i][mask]` is `dp[i - 1][0]`. The previous values of `a[i][j]` do not affect the current update of `dp[i][mask]`, and we note that the conditions regarding `i`, `n`, `mask`, and `a[i - 1][j]` being equal to 1 are satisfied.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` to it, where `mask` is 1 and `j` is 0.**
