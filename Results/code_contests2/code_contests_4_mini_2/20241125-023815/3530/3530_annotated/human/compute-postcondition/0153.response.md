According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, `n` is greater than `1`, and `j` is `2`. Since `j` is equal to `2` and `n` is greater than `1`, it means that `n` must be at least `3` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `j` needs to be incremented to `3` to prepare for the next iteration.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, `n` is greater than `1`, `j` is `3`**
