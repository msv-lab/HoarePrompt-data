Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition where if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. The values of `a[i - 1][j]`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` retains its previous value.***
