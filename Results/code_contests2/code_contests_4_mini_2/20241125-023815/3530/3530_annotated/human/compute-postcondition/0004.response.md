The code appends the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to the list `a`. The `raw_input()` function accepts input, which will be split into separate values and converted to integers by `map(int, ...)`. Since `a` is initially an empty list, after this operation, `a` will contain the list of integers that were inputted. The values of `N`, `MOD`, and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated state of `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than 0**
