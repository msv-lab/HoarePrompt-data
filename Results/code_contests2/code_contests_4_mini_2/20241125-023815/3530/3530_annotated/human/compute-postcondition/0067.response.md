According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3. Given that `n` is greater than 2, this means that `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to be able to execute again. Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3, and `mask` has been incremented by 1.**
