The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Here, `mask` is initially 1 and `j` is 0, so `1 << j` equals 1. The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` results in `1 ^ 1`, which is 0. Therefore, the code effectively adds `dp[i - 1][0]` to `dp[i][1]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `mask` is 1, and `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1, confirming that the conditions are met for the operation to be valid.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `mask` is 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` to it.**
