According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would be equal to `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`, which is out of the current range. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to be `n` and ensure that the loop can no longer execute. 

No other states need to be adjusted since the `dp` array and `mask` are determined by the loop logic and the previous updates made based on the conditions met in the last iteration.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated, j is n**
