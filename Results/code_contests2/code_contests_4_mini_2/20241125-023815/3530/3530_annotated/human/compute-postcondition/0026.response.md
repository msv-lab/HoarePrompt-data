Postcondition: ***`dp[0]` is a list of length `(1 << n)` where each index is initially set to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
