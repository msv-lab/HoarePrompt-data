Postcondition: ***`dp[0]` is a list of length `(1 << n)` with all elements initialized to 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
