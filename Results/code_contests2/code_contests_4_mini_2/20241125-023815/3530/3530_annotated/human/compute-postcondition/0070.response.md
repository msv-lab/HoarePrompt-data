Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]` and the j-th bit of `mask`. If `n` is greater than 0 and there are sufficient entries in `a`, the loop will execute for all values of `mask` from 1 to (1 << n) - 1 and for each `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` will include contributions from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` taken modulo `MOD`. If `n` is 0 or if `a` has fewer than `i` entries, or if all `a[i - 1][j]` are 0, then the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged from its initialized state. In cases where `mask` has no bits set or `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute and `dp[i][mask]` will remain as initialized.**
