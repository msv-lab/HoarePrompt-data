The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of the current value of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The values of `i`, `mask`, `n`, and `j` do not change due to this operation. The specific value of `dp[i][mask]` before the operation is unknown, but it gets modified by the modulus operation.

Therefore, the output state describes that `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `0`, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated to be the remainder of itself divided by `MOD`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `0`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
