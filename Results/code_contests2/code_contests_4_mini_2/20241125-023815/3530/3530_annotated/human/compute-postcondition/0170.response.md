Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` where `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is true. If `a[i - 1][j]` does not equal 1 or the condition fails for all `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
