Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `2`, `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is `1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
