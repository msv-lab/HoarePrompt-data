You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N men and N women, both numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N.

For each i, j (1 \leq i, j \leq N), the compatibility of Man i and Woman j is given as an integer a_{i, j}. If a_{i, j} = 1, Man i and Woman j are compatible; if a_{i, j} = 0, they are not.

Taro is trying to make N pairs, each consisting of a man and a woman who are compatible. Here, each man and each woman must belong to exactly one pair.

Find the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 21
* a_{i, j} is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_{1, 1} \ldots a_{1, N}
:
a_{N, 1} \ldots a_{N, N}


Output

Print the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

def func():

    n = input()
    a = []

If n is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `a` remains an empty list.
    dp = [([0] * (1 << n)) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp[0]` is a list of length `(1 << n)` where each index from 0 to `(1 << n) - 1` is set to 1. If `n` is 0 or not greater than 0, the loop does not execute and `dp` remains unchanged (the initial state of `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where each element is a list of `(1 << n)` zeros).
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for mask in range(1, 1 << n):

                    dp[i][mask] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `n` is greater than 0, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]` being equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` being set, with contributions taken from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, modulo `MOD`. The loop will execute for all `i` from 1 to `n`, and for each `mask` from 1 to `2^n - 1`, provided that there are sufficient entries in `a`. If `n` is 0 or not greater than 0, or if `a` has fewer than `i` entries, or if all entries in `a[i - 1]` are 0, then the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged from its initialized state. In cases where `mask` has no bits set or if `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute and `dp[i][mask]` remains as initialized.
    print(dp[n][(1 << n) - 1])

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
