Correctness: **False**

The provided program only calculates the distance between the two cities using the function `func_1`, but it does not implement the logic necessary to find the minimum detection radius for the radar as described in the problem statement. 

Key issues include:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The program lacks functionality to determine the appropriate placement of the radar and to compute the minimum radius required to detect the enemy from both cities. It only calculates the distance between the two cities without considering their respective rings (the cities' coordinates and the distance from the cities to the enemy).

2. **Missing Logic**: The solution needs to account for the radii of the rings surrounding each city in addition to the distance between the cities. The minimum detection radius must be calculated based on the distance between the cities and the respective radii of the rings.

For example, consider the input:
```
0 0 1
6 0 3
```
- The distance between the two cities is 6.
- The distance from the first city to its ring is 1.
- The distance from the second city to its ring is 3.

The minimum detection radius must be at least the distance between the closest points on the rings, which is calculated as the distance between the centers minus the sum of the radii. The program does not perform this calculation and thus fails to solve the problem as required.

Since the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement, the correctness is deemed **False**.
