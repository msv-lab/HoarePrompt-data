The function `func_1` accepts parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. All these parameters are integers representing the coordinates of two cities. After executing the function body, it returns the distance between the two cities represented by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences in their coordinates. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the coordinates of two cities and return the distance between them. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2, which are integers representing coordinates of two cities, and returns the distance between the two cities.**
