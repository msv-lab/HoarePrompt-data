Functionality: ** The function accepts four parameters, x1, y1, x2, and y2, which are numerical values representing the coordinates of two points in a two-dimensional space. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points using the formula `sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)`. The function does not handle any potential errors or edge cases, such as non-numeric inputs or overflow errors in the computation. **
