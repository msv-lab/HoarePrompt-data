The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The parameters `x1` and `y1` are integers representing the coordinates of the first city, while `x2` and `y2` are integers representing the coordinates of the second city. After executing the function body, it returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities located at coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept the coordinates of two distinct cities and return the Euclidean distance between them.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of two distinct cities and returns the Euclidean distance between these cities.**
