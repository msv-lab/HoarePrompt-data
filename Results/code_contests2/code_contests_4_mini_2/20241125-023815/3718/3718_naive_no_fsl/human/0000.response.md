To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and how it handles different scenarios based on the problem description.

The problem requires us to find the minimum detection radius `r` for a radar that can simultaneously detect movements from two enemy circles defined by their centers and radii. 

Here's the breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Distance Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the Euclidean distance `d` between the two cities using their coordinates.

2. **Conditions for Radar Radius**:
   - The first condition checks if the sum of the two radii (`r1 + r2`) is less than the distance `d` between the two cities. If true, it calculates the required radar radius as `(d - r1 - r2) / 2.0`. This scenario implies that the circles do not overlap and the radar must be placed in between them.
   - The second condition checks if the absolute difference of the two radii (`abs(r1 - r2)`) is greater than the distance `d`. If true, it calculates the required radar radius as `(abs(r1 - r2) - d) / 2.0`. This case implies that one circle is completely inside the other without touching.

3. **Output**: The program prints the computed radar radius formatted to six decimal places.

Now, let's analyze edge cases:

- **Touching Circles**: If the two circles touch at one point (e.g., `d = r1 + r2`), the radar should have a radius of `0` because it can be placed at the touching point.
- **Overlapping Circles**: If the circles overlap, the radar radius should also be `0` because it can be placed anywhere within the overlap region.
- **Circle Inside Another**: If one circle is completely inside the other without touching, the second condition should correctly compute the radar radius.

The provided code does not handle the case where the circles are touching (`d == r1 + r2`) or overlapping (i.e., `d < r1 + r2` and `d > abs(r1 - r2)`), as it only covers non-touching and non-overlapping cases explicitly.

**Example of a failing case**:
Consider the case where:
```
0 0 1
1 0 1
```
Here, the distance `d` between the cities is `1`, and `r1 + r2 = 2`. According to the program, since `r1 + r2` is not less than `d`, it does not enter the first condition, and since `abs(r1 - r2) = 0` is not greater than `1`, it does not enter the second condition either. The output will be `0.0`, which is incorrect because the circles are touching and the radar should be able to detect movements with a radius of `0` at the touching point.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
