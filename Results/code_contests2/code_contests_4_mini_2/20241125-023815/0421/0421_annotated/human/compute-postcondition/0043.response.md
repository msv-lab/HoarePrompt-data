The value of `flag` is set to `False`, changing it from its previous value of `True`. The values of `nums` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
