Postcondition: ***`flag` is set to True initially. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `flag` remains True. Furthermore, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0.***
