Output State: **`flag` is set to `False` if there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in `nums` such that the absolute difference between them is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, `flag` remains `True`. If `nums` has only one element, the loop does not execute and `flag` remains `True`.**
