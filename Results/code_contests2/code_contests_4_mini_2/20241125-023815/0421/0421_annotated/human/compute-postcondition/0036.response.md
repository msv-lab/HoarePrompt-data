According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as both `flag` is `True` and `nums` is not empty. 

At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is set to `False` if there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in `nums` such that the absolute difference between them is greater than or equal to 2. Since `flag` is currently `False`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `flag` must be adjusted to `True`. 

Additionally, since the loop continues as long as `nums` is not empty, we need to ensure that `nums` still contains elements, assuming it was not emptied in the last iteration. However, since the statement only specifies that the maximum value in `nums` is removed without further context, we cannot definitively say if `nums` is still non-empty.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to allow the loop to execute one more time are to set `flag` to `True` and ensure that `nums` has at least one element remaining.

State: **`flag` is set to True and `nums` is not empty**
