According to the code, the loop can continue executing as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 to 1. The length of `nums` remains unchanged, still being at least 2, which allows the loop to check the next pair of elements.

State: **`flag` is set to True, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
