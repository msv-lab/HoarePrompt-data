The value of `flag` is set to `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`nums`, `i`, and the absolute difference condition) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the value of `flag`.

Output State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2**
