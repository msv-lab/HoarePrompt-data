According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last index of `nums`, which is `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `len(nums) - 1 + 1`, which will exceed the allowed range for `i`. 

Since `nums` has at least 2 elements, the loop has already checked the last valid index, and there are no additional elements to check. Thus, there are no adjustments needed for `nums`, but `i` must be adjusted to indicate that it has exceeded its valid range.

State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`**
