Postcondition: ***`n` is a string input, `nums` is a map object of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains unchanged, and the execution continues without breaking.***
