According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `nums` is a map object of integers with at least 2 elements, meaning it must have at least 3 elements to allow for another iteration. 

To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Additionally, since the loop condition is `i < len(nums) - 1`, for `i` to still satisfy this condition after the increment, `len(nums)` must be at least 4.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a string input, `nums` is a map object of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3**
