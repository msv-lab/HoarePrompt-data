According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. Given that `i` is currently 0 and `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 elements, the length of `nums` is at least 2, which means `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. So, to prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented to 1.

The other states (`n` and `nums`) do not need to be adjusted since they are not directly related to the loop's iteration condition.

State: **`n` is a string input, `nums` is a map object of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
