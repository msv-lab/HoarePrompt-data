The variable `flag` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the previous values of `n` or `nums`. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial values and includes the new assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is a string input, `nums` is a list of integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100, `flag` is True**
