According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty.

At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements (since it had at least 3 before removing the maximum element), which means `nums` still contains elements. The `flag` needs to remain True for the loop to continue. Since `flag` is unchanged, it will depend on the absolute differences of adjacent elements in the original `nums`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must be True and `nums` must still contain at least 1 element. As `nums` has had its maximum element removed but still has at least 2 elements, `nums` is still valid. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for `nums` or `flag`.

State: **`nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `flag` is unchanged**.
