Output State: **If `nums` is a map object containing fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and `flag` remains True. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` will be set to False if any adjacent elements in `nums` have an absolute difference of 2 or more; otherwise, `flag` remains True. After the loop, `i` will be one less than the length of `nums` minus one, indicating the last index checked.**
