Output State: **If `nums` is empty or `flag` is False initially, the loop does not execute, and `nums` remains unchanged while `flag` is True. If `nums` has at least 1 element, the maximum element is removed, and `flag` will remain True if there are fewer than 2 elements left in `nums`, or it may be set to False if any adjacent elements in the remaining `nums` have an absolute difference of 2 or more. The loop continues until `nums` is empty or `flag` becomes False. If `nums` becomes empty, `flag` remains unchanged.**
