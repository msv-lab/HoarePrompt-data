The value of `flag` is assigned to `False`. The previous value of `flag` was `True`, so after execution, `flag` is now `False`. The states of the other variables (`nums` and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `flag` is now `False`, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`flag` is now False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0**
