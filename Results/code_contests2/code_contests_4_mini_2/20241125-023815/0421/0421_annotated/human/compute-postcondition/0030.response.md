The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the other variables in the initial state, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and `flag` is `False`.

Output State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and `flag` is `False`**
