Postcondition: ***Given that `flag` is set to True, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1, if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is 2 or more, `flag` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains True, maintaining its initial state.***
