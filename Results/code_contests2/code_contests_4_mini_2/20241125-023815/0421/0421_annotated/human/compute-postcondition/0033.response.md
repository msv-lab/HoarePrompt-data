According to the code, the loop can execute again if the index `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, which means the loop cannot execute again because `i` is not less than `len(nums) - 1`. 

Since `nums` has at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to `len(nums) - 2`. No other states need to be adjusted, as the condition regarding the absolute difference and the state of `flag` does not affect the ability to enter the loop again.

State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`**
