Postcondition: ***`n` is a string input, `nums` is a map object of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains unchanged, and no action is taken regarding the loop or if statement.***
