The function `func` accepts user input for a list of integers and evaluates whether the absolute difference between any two adjacent integers in that list is less than 2. It continues this evaluation until the list is empty or a pair of adjacent integers with an absolute difference of 2 or more is found. The function removes the maximum integer from the list in each iteration of the loop. If the loop exits without finding such a pair, it indicates that all adjacent integers have an acceptable difference, and the function prints 'YES'. If the loop exits early due to finding a pair with an unacceptable difference, it prints 'NO'.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers entered by the user and checks if all adjacent integers have an absolute difference of less than 2 after repeatedly removing the maximum integer from the list. It prints 'YES' if the condition holds for all adjacent pairs or 'NO' otherwise. **
