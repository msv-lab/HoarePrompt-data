The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and `nums` is a list of integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100. Based on these inputs, the function performs operations and produces an output. 

Since the specific output behavior is not provided, we can only note that the function will utilize these constraints in its processing. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a list of integers nums (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element ai in nums), and produces a result based on these inputs.**
