According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. Since `nums` has at least 1 element, `len(nums) - 1` will be at least 0. However, for the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be greater than 1 so that `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1. Additionally, the loop variable `i` will start at 0 before the first iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the conditions must be that `nums` has at least 2 elements and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is True, `i` is 0**
