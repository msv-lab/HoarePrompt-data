According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.

The `nums` list has at least 2 elements, so it will remain valid for the next iteration. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` should be updated to 2.

Since the absolute difference condition does not affect the loop's ability to execute again (it only affects the `flag`), we don't need to make any adjustments to `flag` or the contents of `nums`.

State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
