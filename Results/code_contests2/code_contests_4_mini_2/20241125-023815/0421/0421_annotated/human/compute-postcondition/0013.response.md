The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged; `n` is a string input, `nums` is a map object of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 2. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string input, `nums` is a map object of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `flag` is False.

Output State: **`n` is a string input, `nums` is a map object of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `flag` is False**
