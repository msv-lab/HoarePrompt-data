The code assigns the value `False` to the variable `flag`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and since `flag` is initialized, the output state remains consistent with the initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums) - 1, and `flag` is False.

Output State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums) - 1, and `flag` is False**
