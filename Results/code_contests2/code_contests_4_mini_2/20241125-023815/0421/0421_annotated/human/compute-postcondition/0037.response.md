According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the expression `len(nums) - 1` is greater than 0. This means that `len(nums)` must be at least 2 for the loop to run. Since `nums` is stated to be not empty, it has at least one element, but we need at least two elements for the loop to execute at least once.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will have been incremented, starting from 0. Since `i` will take on values from 0 to `len(nums) - 2` during the execution of the loop, we can set `i` to 0 before the loop starts.

To summarize, for the loop to execute, the number of elements in `nums` must be at least 2, and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`flag` is set to True, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
