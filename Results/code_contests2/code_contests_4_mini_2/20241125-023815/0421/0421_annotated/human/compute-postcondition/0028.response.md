Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 2 elements and `i` is the last index of `nums`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the loop or if statement is exited. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains unchanged and the loop continues.***
