The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string input, `nums` is a map object of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `flag` is False.

Output State: **`n` is a string input, `nums` is a map object of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `flag` is False**
