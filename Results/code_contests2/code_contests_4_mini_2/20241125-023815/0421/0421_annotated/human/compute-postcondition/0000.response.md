The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input as a string. Since `n` is expected to be a positive integer between 1 and 10, the output state reflects that `n` is now a string input. The state of `nums` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string input, `nums` is a list of integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100.

Output State: **`n` is a string input, `nums` is a list of integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100**
