According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `flag` is True and `nums` has at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 1 element after removing the maximum element, meaning there is still at least one element left in `nums`. Since `flag` remains True only if `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, it indicates that `nums` must currently have exactly 1 element for the loop to execute one more time. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are that `nums` must be at least 1 element (which it is), and `flag` must be True, which it already is. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`nums` has at least 1 element, `flag` is True**
