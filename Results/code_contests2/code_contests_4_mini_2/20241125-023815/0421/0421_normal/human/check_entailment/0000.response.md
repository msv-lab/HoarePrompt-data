Let's analyze the given program against the provided problem description and output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to determine whether a sequence of stacks (represented by an array of integers) can be sorted using a specific procedure involving the sliding of ravioli. The main points of the procedure are:
1. Identify the tallest stack.
2. Remove it and append its height to the output array.
3. If the difference in height between any two adjacent stacks is 2 or more, the taller stack will slide down into the lower stack, potentially altering the state before the tallest stack is processed.

### Code Analysis:
The program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers. It uses a flag to track whether the condition is violated, iterating through adjacent elements and checking if their absolute difference is 2 or more. If such a pair is found, it sets the flag to False and breaks out of the loop. Then, it removes the maximum from the list until it is empty, printing "YES" or "NO" based on the flag.

### Issues with the Code:
1. **Stack Removal Logic**: The loop that checks for adjacent differences does not account for the situation where the tallest stack might slide down before it gets removed. This is crucial because if the tallest stack is adjacent to a smaller stack that it can slide onto, it will change the heights of both stacks, disrupting the order. 
2. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until `nums` is empty, but the check for `flag` only happens once at the end of the loop, which is not sufficient for determining the correct order of removals.
3. **Input Handling**: The code uses `raw_input()` which may be problematic, depending on the version of Python (it seems to mix Python 2 and 3).

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function checks consecutive numbers for an absolute difference of less than 2, which aligns with the logic in the code. However, this doesn't fully capture the behavior described in the problem where the taller stack can affect the state of adjacent stacks, leading to a potential miscalculation of whether the stacks can be sorted.

### Example Cases:
Considering the example provided in the problem:
- For the input `3\n3 1 2`, the program should output "NO" because the tallest stack (3) would slide down on the stack of height 1 before it could be removed, resulting in a different state than expected.

### Conclusion:
The code does not adequately handle the sliding behavior of stacks as described in the problem, which can lead to incorrect outputs for certain cases. Specifically, the program fails to account for the scenario where a taller stack can affect the adjacent shorter stack before being removed.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases, particularly in scenarios where stacks slide down before being processed.
