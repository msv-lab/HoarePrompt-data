The function accepts user input for a list of integers and checks whether all consecutive numbers have an absolute difference of less than 2. It prints 'YES' if this condition is met for the entire list, or 'NO' if any consecutive numbers violate this condition. If the list is initially empty, it prints 'YES' since no violations can occur.
