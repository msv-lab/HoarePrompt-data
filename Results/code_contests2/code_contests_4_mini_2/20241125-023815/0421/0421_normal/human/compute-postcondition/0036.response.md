To determine the conditions under which the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop conditions: `flag` and `nums`.

1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `flag` is true and `nums` is not empty.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, which means it is not empty.
3. The variable `flag` remains unchanged and its value is not specified, but for the loop to execute again, `flag` must be true.

Since `nums` has at least 2 elements, it will still have at least 1 element after removing the maximum element from it (the maximum element was removed in the previous iteration). Therefore, `nums` will not be empty, which means it satisfies one part of the loop condition.

The only condition we need to ensure for the loop to execute one more time is that `flag` must be true.

Thus, we do not need to change the state of `nums`, but we must state that `flag` is true.

State: **`nums` has at least 1 element and `flag` is true**
