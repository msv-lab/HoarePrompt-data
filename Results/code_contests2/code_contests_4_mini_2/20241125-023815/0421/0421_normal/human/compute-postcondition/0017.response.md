The loop checks the absolute difference between consecutive integers in the `nums` map object. If any difference is found to be greater than or equal to 2, the loop sets `flag` to False and breaks out of the loop. If all consecutive integers in `nums` have an absolute difference of less than 2, `flag` remains True.

The loop will not execute if `nums` contains fewer than 2 integers, in which case `flag` remains True.

Output State: **If `nums` contains at least 2 integers, `flag` will be False if any absolute difference between consecutive integers is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, `flag` remains True. If `nums` contains fewer than 2 integers, `flag` remains True.**
