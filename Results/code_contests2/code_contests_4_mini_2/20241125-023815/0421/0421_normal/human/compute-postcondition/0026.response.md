The value of `flag` is assigned `False`. The initial value of `flag` remains unchanged before this assignment. The states of `nums` and `i` are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `flag` is now False.

Output State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `flag` is False**
