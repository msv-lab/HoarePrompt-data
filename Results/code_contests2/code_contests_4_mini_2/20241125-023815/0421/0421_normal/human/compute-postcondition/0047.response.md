The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables, `nums` and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, and `flag` is False.

Output State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, and `flag` is False**
