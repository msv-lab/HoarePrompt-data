The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `flag` was `True`, but it is now changed. The other variables, `n`, `nums`, and `i`, remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `flag`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10; `nums` is a map object containing at least 3 integers; `flag` is False; `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2**
