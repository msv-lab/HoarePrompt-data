According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, which means the loop can execute one more time. Since `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

No other states need to be adjusted since the conditions provided indicate that the loop can still run. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10, `nums` is a map object containing at least 3 integers, `i` is less than `len(nums)`, and `flag` remains unchanged**
