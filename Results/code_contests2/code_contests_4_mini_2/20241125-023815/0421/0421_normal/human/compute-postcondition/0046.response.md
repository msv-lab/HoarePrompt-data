According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, which means `len(nums)` is at least 2. Therefore, `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1. 

Since `i` is the loop variable and it is incremented with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. If `i` is currently at the last valid index (which is `len(nums) - 2`), it can execute one more time.

Therefore, if the last iteration had `i` equal to `len(nums) - 2`, then for the next iteration, `i` would be incremented to `len(nums) - 1`. The condition for the loop to execute again is thus satisfied.

State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1` (so `i` is `len(nums) - 2`)**
