The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is 0, and we break out of the loop.

Output State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is 0, and we break out of the loop.**
