Output State: **If `nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` will be `False` if any consecutive elements `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` have an absolute difference of 2 or greater; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged. If `nums` has only 1 element, the loop does not execute, and `flag` remains unchanged.**
