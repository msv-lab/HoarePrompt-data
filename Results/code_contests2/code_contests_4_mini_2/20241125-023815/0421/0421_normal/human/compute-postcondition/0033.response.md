According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `nums` has at least 4 elements, which means `len(nums)` is at least 4. Therefore, `len(nums) - 1` is at least 3. Since `i` is currently 2, the loop can execute one more time.

No other states need to be adjusted as `flag` and `nums` do not affect the loop's execution condition. The only adjustment needed is to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`nums` has at least 4 elements, `i` is 3**
