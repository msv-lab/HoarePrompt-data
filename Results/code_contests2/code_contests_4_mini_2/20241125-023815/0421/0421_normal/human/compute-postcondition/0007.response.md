Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, and initially `flag` is True. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains True.***
