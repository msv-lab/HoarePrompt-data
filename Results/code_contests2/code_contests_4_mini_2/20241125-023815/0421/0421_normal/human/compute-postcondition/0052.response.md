The code `nums.remove(max(nums))` removes the maximum element from the list `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, the maximum element is removed, which may impact the values of `flag` if the maximum element was adjacent to another element with an absolute difference of 2 or more. However, the state of `flag` is not directly affected by this line of code. If `nums` has only 1 element, removing the maximum element will leave `nums` empty, and `flag` remains unchanged as the loop does not execute.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the maximum value has been removed from `nums`, but the state of `flag` depends on the initial conditions and is not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`nums` has one less element (the maximum removed), and `flag` remains unchanged based on the previous conditions.**
