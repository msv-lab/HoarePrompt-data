According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`, which means that `i` can be incremented to allow the loop to execute one more time.

Since `i` can increase by 1 and still be within the bounds of the loop condition, we need to adjust `i` to reflect this. The loop condition is satisfied as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, so we can set `i` to `i + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `n` remains between 1 and 10, and `nums` still contains at least 3 integers.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10, `nums` is a map object containing at least 3 integers, and `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`.**
