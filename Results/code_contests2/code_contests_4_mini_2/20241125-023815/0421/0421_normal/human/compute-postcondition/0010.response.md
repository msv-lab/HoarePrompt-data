The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10; `nums` is a map object containing at least 3 integers; `flag` is False; `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
