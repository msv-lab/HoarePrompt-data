The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, `flag` is False, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
