The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables `nums` and `i` are not modified by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `flag` while retaining the previous values of `nums` and `i`.

Output State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`**
