The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input value as a string. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10 in the initial state, it will now hold the string representation of that integer. Other variables, including `nums`, are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10 (now as a string), and `nums` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10 (now as a string), and `nums` remains unchanged**
