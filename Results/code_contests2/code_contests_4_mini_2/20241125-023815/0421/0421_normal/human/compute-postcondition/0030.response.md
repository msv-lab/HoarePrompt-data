The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous state of `flag` is unchanged, and the values of `nums` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment to `flag` and mentions the other variable states as they were.

Output State: **`nums` has at least 4 elements, `i` is 2, `flag` is False**
