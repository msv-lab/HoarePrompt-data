The function `func` accepts input from the user, which includes an integer `n` (though it is not actually used in the function logic) and a list of integers `nums` obtained from user input. It then checks the absolute differences between consecutive numbers in `nums`. If any consecutive numbers have an absolute difference of 2 or more, it sets a flag to `False` and breaks the loop. If all consecutive numbers have an absolute difference of less than 2, the function continues to remove the maximum element from `nums` until it is empty or until the condition is violated. The function ultimately prints 'YES' if the flag remains `True` (indicating that all absolute differences were less than 2) and 'NO' otherwise.

However, there are several important considerations:
- The variable `n` is read but not utilized, making its presence misleading.
- The function uses `raw_input()` which is not compatible with Python 3, as it should be `input()`.
- If `nums` is empty to start with, the loop does not execute, and 'YES' is printed since `flag` remains `True`.
- The handling of the list may lead to issues if the list becomes empty before the loop completes, but the nature of the while loop and for loop manages this gracefully.

Functionality: ** The function accepts user input for a list of integers and checks whether all consecutive numbers have an absolute difference of less than 2. It prints 'YES' if this condition is met for the entire list, or 'NO' if any consecutive numbers violate this condition. If the list is initially empty, it prints 'YES' since no violations can occur.**
