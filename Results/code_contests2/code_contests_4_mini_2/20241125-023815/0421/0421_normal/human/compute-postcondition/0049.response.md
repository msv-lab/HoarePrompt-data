Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 2 elements and `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains unchanged and the program continues execution.***
