The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value of `True`. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `i`) remain unaffected in this snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, `flag` is False, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, `flag` is False, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2**.
