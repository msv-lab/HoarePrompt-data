According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. The loop iterates from `0` to `len(nums) - 2`, which means that for the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be at least `2`. Given that `nums` has at least 1 element, it must be adjusted to have at least 2 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be the last value it takes before the loop ends, which will be `len(nums) - 2`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `nums` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is initially `0`, and `flag` remains true.

State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is true, `i` is 0**
