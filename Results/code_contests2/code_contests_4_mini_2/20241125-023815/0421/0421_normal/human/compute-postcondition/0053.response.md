According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute again if both `flag` is true and `nums` contains at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has one less element (the maximum removed), which indicates that there is at least one element left in `nums`. However, we do not have information about the value of `flag` from the previous iteration. Since `flag` remains unchanged and we need it to be true for the loop to execute again, we cannot make adjustments to `flag`, as we are instructed to maintain the previous conditions.

Therefore, the state does not need any adjustments to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`nums` has one less element (the maximum removed), and `flag` remains unchanged based on the previous conditions.**
