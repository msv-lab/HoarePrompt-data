According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. The loop will continue to execute if `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `nums` has at least 2 elements, meaning that `len(nums)` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1 in the next iteration. The condition for exiting the loop depends on the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]`. Since `i` is now 1, we need to consider the elements at indices 1 and 2.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `i` should be 1 for the next iteration.
- The condition regarding the absolute difference is not explicitly stated in the current state, so we can leave `flag` unchanged as it remains dependent on the loop execution.

State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `flag` remains unchanged**.
