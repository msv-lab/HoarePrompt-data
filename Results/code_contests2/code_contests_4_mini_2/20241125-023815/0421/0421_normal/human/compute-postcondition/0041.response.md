Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 2 elements and `flag` is true initially. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the current loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains true.***
