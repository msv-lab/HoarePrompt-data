The loop iterates as long as `flag` is `True` and `nums` is not empty. During each iteration, the loop checks the absolute difference between consecutive numbers in `nums`. If any such difference is 2 or greater, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks the inner loop. After the inner loop, it removes the maximum value from `nums`. 

If `nums` contains only one element or all elements are such that their absolute differences are less than 2, `flag` will remain `True` throughout the loop execution, and the loop will only stop when `nums` becomes empty.

Output State: **If `nums` starts with at least one element and all consecutive numbers have an absolute difference less than 2, then `flag` remains `True` and `nums` is reduced until it's empty. If `nums` contains elements with an absolute difference of 2 or more, `flag` becomes `False` and the loop stops, leaving `nums` with some elements removed. If `nums` is initially empty, the loop does not execute and `flag` remains `True`, and `nums` is unchanged.**
