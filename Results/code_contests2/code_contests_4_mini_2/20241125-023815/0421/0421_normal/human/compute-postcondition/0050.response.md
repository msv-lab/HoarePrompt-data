According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, which means that the loop can indeed execute one more time. 

The only adjustment needed is to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration. Since `nums` has at least 2 elements, `len(nums)` is at least 2, so `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect the next index.

State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1` + 1**
