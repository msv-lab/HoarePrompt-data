According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as both `flag` is true and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has been modified by removing the maximum integer, and `flag` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must still be true, and `nums` must contain at least one element.

Since `nums` has already been modified to remove the maximum integer, we need to ensure that it still contains elements. This means that `nums` must have been greater than one element before the maximum was removed. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `nums` to indicate that it still has at least one element left.

State: **`nums` has at least one element remaining, `flag` is unchanged**
