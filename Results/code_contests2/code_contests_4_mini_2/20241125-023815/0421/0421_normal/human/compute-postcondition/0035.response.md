The `nums.remove(max(nums))` line removes the maximum element from the list `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, it will remove that maximum element, potentially changing the list and affecting the state of `flag` based on the new configuration of the list. However, the specific impact on `flag` cannot be determined without knowing the values in `nums`.

If `nums` has only 1 element, the loop does not execute, and `flag` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `nums` and the unchanged state of `flag`.

Output State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements and the maximum element has been removed; `flag` remains unchanged.**
