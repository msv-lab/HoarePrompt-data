The value of `flag` is assigned `False`. The other variables `n`, `nums`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables along with the new assignment of `flag`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10, `nums` is a map object containing at least 3 integers, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1, and `flag` is False**
