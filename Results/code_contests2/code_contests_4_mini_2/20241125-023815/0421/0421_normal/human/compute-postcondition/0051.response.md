Output State: **If `nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` will be set to False if any adjacent elements have an absolute difference of 2 or more. If all adjacent elements have an absolute difference of less than 2, `flag` remains true. If `nums` has only 1 element, the loop does not execute, and `flag` remains true.**
