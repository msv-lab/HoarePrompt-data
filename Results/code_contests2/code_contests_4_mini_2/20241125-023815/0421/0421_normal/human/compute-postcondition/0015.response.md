Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10, `nums` is a map object containing at least 3 integers, and `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, the program continues without any changes to `flag`.***
