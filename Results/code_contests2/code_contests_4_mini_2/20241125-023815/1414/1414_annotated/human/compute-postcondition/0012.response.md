Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `a` is a positive integer representing the number of nuts after the operation: if `b` > 0, `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0; otherwise, `a` is decreased by `v`. In both cases, `b` remains 0, `v` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box (1 ≤ `v` ≤ 1000), and `res` is 1.***
