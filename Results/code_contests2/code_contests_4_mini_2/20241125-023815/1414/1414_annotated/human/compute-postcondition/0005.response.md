The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)` from it. Since `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ 1000`, the value of `(k - 1)` will range from 1 to 999. Therefore, the new value of `b` will be `b - (k - 1)`, but since `b` is a non-negative integer, it must be ensured that the updated value of `b` remains non-negative after this operation.

Assuming `b` was initially large enough before the operation, it will now be decreased by a value between 1 and 999. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, `v` is a positive integer, and `res` is 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, `v` is a positive integer, and `res` is 1**
