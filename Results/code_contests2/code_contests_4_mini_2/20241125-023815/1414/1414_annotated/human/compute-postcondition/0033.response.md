Output State: **If `a` is greater than 0, the loop will execute and `res` will count the number of iterations until `a` is no longer positive. In each iteration, if `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v` and `b` is decreased by `k - 1`. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is 0, then `a` is simply decreased by `v`. If `a` starts off at 0 or decreases to 0 during the loop, the loop will terminate. After the loop, `res` will reflect the total number of iterations executed, `a` will be the remaining number of nuts (which could potentially be 0 or negative if `a` was not sufficient to cover the decrements), and `b` will either be 0 or a negative number if not enough nuts were present for the decrements made based on the conditions. If `a` is initially 0 or less, the loop won't execute, `res` will remain 0, and both `a` and `b` will stay unchanged.**
