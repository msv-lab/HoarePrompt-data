Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `a` is a positive integer representing the number of nuts after the operation, and `b` is a non-negative integer representing the number of divisors. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v` and `b` is decreased by `k - 1`. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`. In all cases, `v` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box (1 ≤ `v` ≤ 1000), and `res` remains 1.***
