The function `func` accepts four parameters: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`. 

- `k` is an integer with a constraint that it must be between 2 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `a` is a positive integer representing the number of nuts, constrained to be between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `b` is a non-negative integer representing the number of divisors, constrained to be between 0 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `v` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box, constrained to be between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

The function returns a value based on the provided constraints and relationships of these parameters. However, the specific output based on these inputs has not been detailed in the original statement.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters k (an integer between 2 and 1000), a (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), b (a non-negative integer between 0 and 1000), and v (a positive integer between 1 and 1000). The specific output based on these parameters is not described.**
