The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is not specified. The condition that `a` is greater than 0 does not affect the increment operation. Therefore, the output state only indicates the change in `res`.

Output State: **`res` is increased by 1, and `a` is greater than 0**
