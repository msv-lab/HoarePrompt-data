Postcondition: ***`res` is increased by 1, `a` is greater than 0 after being decreased by either `v` or `(b + 1) * v` depending on the value of `b`. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is decreased by `v` after being modified by subtracting `(b + 1) * v`. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by `v` directly. In either case, `b` is set to 0.***
