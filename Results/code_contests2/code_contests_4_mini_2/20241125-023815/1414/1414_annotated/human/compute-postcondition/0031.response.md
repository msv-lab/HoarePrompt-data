Postcondition: ***`res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v` and `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)`, while `a` remains greater than 0. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v`, and `b` is set to 0, ensuring `a` is still greater than 0 after the operation. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by `v` directly, maintaining that `a` is greater than 0.*
