Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `a` is a positive integer representing the number of nuts (1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000), `b` is a non-negative integer representing the number of divisors (0 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000), `v` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box (1 ≤ `v` ≤ 1000), `res` is 1, and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
