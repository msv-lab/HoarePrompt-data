Postcondition: ***`res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v` and `b` is decreased by (k - 1). If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`.***
