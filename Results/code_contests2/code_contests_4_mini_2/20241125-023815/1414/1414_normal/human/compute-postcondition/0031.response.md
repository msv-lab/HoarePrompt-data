Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than (k * v), and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by k * v and `b` is decreased by (k - 1), while `a` remains greater than (k * v). If `b` is greater than 0 but less than k, then `a` is decreased by (b + 1) * v and `b` is set to 0, with `a` still remaining greater than (k * v). If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by v, and `a` remains greater than (k * v).***
