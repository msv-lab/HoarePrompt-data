Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 1000), `a` is greater than (k * v). If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `b` is decreased by `k - 1`, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v`, `b` is set to 0, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`, and `res` is increased by 1. In all cases, `a` remains greater than (k * v) after the adjustments.***
