The value of `b` is assigned the value `0`. Since `b` was previously an integer (0 ≤ b ≤ 1000), the assignment does not affect any other variables. The output state is: `k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is now `a - (b + 1) * v`, `b` is 0, and `res` remains increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is now `a - (b + 1) * v`, `b` is 0, and `res` remains increased by 1**
