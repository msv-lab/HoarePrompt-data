Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than (k * v), and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is decreased by (b + 1) * v and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`. In both cases, the value of `a` remains greater than (k * v) after the respective modifications.***
