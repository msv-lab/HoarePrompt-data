The variable `res` is initialized to 0. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` remain unchanged as they are assigned from input. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `v` is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000), and `res` is 0.

Output State: **`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `v` is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000), and `res` is 0**
