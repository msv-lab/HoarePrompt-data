Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), and `b` is an integer (1 ≤ b < k). If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. Otherwise, `a` is decremented by `v`, and `b` is also set to 0. In both cases, `v` is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000), and `res` remains 1. Edge cases include when `b` is 0, in which case `a` is simply reduced by `v`, ensuring that the constraints on `a` are maintained.***
