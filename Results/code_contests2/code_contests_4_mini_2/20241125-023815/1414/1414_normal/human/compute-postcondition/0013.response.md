Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), and `b` is an integer (0 ≤ b ≤ 1000). If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v`, and `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`, and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is 0, `a` is simply decreased by `v` while `b` remains 0. In all cases, `v` is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000), and `res` remains 1, ensuring that the constraints on `a` are preserved throughout the execution.***
