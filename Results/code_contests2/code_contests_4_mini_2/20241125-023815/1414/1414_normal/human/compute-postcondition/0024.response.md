The value of `res` is incremented by 1 with the statement `res += 1`. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`k` and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than (k * v), and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than (k * v), and `res` is increased by 1**
