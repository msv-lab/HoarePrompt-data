Correctness: **False**

The provided code snippet only includes a function `func_1` that determines if a character is a consonant by checking if it is not a vowel (i.e., not in 'aeiou'). However, it does not address the main requirements of the problem statement, which is to detect and correct typos in a word based on the rules specified.

To illustrate the shortcomings:

1. The function does not analyze the entire word for the presence of three or more consecutive consonants.
2. There is no logic to handle the case where the block of consonants has all the same letters (which should not be considered a typo).
3. There is no mechanism to insert spaces into the word to split it into valid segments when typos are detected.

For example, if we take the input "hellno", the expected behavior according to the problem description is to split it into "hell no". However, the current implementation does not perform this operation, and thus it fails to meet the requirements of the task.

Since the program does not implement the necessary logic to detect and correct typos in accordance with the problem description, it is deemed incorrect.
