To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program processes the input string to identify words with typos and how it inserts spaces to correct them.

### Analyzing the Program:

1. **Functionality of `func_1(ch)`**: This function correctly identifies consonants by checking if the character is not a vowel (i.e., not in 'aeiou').

2. **Iterating Through the String**: The loop iterates through the string while checking for sequences of three consecutive consonants.

3. **Identifying Typos**: The condition `(s[i] != s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] != s[i + 2])` is intended to check if the three consonants are not all the same. However, it is incorrectly structured. It should check all three characters, which means it should be `(s[i] != s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] != s[i + 2] or s[i] != s[i + 2])`.

4. **Handling Spaces**: If a typo is found, the program inserts a space after two consonants (e.g., `s[i] + '' + s[i + 1] + ' '`), which is incorrect because it does not handle the case where more than three consonants are present correctly.

5. **Final Output**: The program appends the remaining characters in the string but does not ensure the final output is well-formatted to comply with the requirements.

### Example Case:

Let's consider a case that the program fails to handle correctly:

**Input**: `"bbbaaaaccc"`  
**Expected Output**: `"bbb aaaccc"` (should split after the first three 'b's since they are not all the same)  
**Actual Output**: The program would incorrectly process the string and may not insert the space appropriately between the consonants, leading to a faulty output.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle all edge cases as per the problem description, especially the one highlighted above, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
