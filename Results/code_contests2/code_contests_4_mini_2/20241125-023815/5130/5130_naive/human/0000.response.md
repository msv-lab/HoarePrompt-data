To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it meets the requirements for all potential cases.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: 
   - An integer `n` representing the number of skewers.
   - A permutation `p` which shows how the skewers will be moved.
   - A binary sequence `b` that determines if the skewer will be reversed.

2. **Output**: 
   - The minimum total number of elements in `p` and `b` that need to be changed so that every skewer visits each of the `2n` placements.

### Code Analysis:
The code provided performs the following:
- It reads integer `n`, the permutation `p`, and the binary sequence `b`.
- It initializes an array `comps` to track the components of the permutation and a counter `col` for the number of components.
- The outer loop iterates through each index and uses a while loop to traverse through the permutation, marking components.
- Finally, it checks if there's only one component (i.e., `col == 1`). If so, it adds `0` to the result, otherwise it adds the count of components. It also checks if the sum of `b` is `0` to potentially add `1` to the result.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Component Count**: The logic to count components is correct but does not account for cases where skewers do not visit all positions. It only checks if `col > 1` and assumes more components need more changes.
2. **Reversal Check**: The logic for checking if `b` contains any `1`s is correct, but it may not capture cases where multiple changes to `b` are needed to achieve the goal.
3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not account for cases where `n = 1`, which can lead to incorrect assumptions about the number of changes required.

### Counter Example:
For a case where `n = 1`:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  1
  0
  ```
- Expected output: `1` since `b[0]` needs to be changed to `1` to ensure the skewer visits the reversed position.
- Actual output from the program: `1` (which is correct).

However, consider the case:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  2 1 3
  0 0 0
  ```
- Expected output: `1` since changing any single `b[i]` to `1` would work.
- Actual output from the program: `2` since it counts two components (`2` and `1` are in one component, `3` is alone).

### Conclusion:
Since there exists an input where the program does not yield the correct output according to the problem description, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
