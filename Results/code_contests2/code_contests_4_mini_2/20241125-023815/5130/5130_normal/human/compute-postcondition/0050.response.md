Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`, and `comps` is a list of integers where `comps[i]` is initially 0. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is set to `col`, and `j` will iterate through valid indices of `p` such that `comps[p[j]]` is 0, updating `comps[j]` to `col` for each valid index derived from `p`. If at any point, `j` points to an index that is out of bounds for `p`, or if `p[j]` results in an index out of bounds for `comps`, an error occurs. If `comps[i]` is not 0, then `comps` remains unchanged. In all cases, `j` will be the last valid index checked during the iterations, and `col` reflects the total number of unique cycles encountered.***
