The code assigns the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to the variable `b`. This means that `b` will now hold a list of integers, which are converted from the input values provided through `raw_input()`. The initial state of `b` as a list of zeros and ones is overwritten by the new input values. The variables `n` and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing the permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is now a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing the permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is now a list of integers based on the input.**
