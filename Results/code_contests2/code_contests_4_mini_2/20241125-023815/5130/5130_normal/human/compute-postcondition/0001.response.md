The value of `p` is assigned a list comprehension that takes each element `v` from the input (a space-separated string of integers), converts it to an integer, subtracts 1 from it, and constructs a list. Since `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, each value in `p` will be in the range from 0 to `n-1` after the subtraction. The other variables `n` and `b` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing the permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing the permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length `n`.**
