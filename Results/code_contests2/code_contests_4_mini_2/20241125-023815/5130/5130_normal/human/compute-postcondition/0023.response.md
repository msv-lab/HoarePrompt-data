The statement `comps[i] = col` assigns the value of `col` to the index `i` in the `comps` list. Given that `i` is equal to `n` and `comps[i]` was initially 0, the value at `comps[n]` is now updated to the value of `col`. Since `col` has been increased by 1, `comps[n]` will be set to the new value of `col`. Other variables are not affected directly by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers based on the input; `comps[i]` is `col`; `i` is `n`; `j` is the last index accessed; `col` is increased by 1.**
