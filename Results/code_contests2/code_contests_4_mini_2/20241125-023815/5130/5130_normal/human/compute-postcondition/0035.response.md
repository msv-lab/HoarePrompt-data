Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers based on the input, and `comps` is a list of integers where `comps[i]` is initially 0. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is set to `col`, and `j` is updated to `i`. The while loop executes as long as `comps[p[j]]` is 0, updating `comps[j]` to `col` and setting `j` to `p[j]` in each iteration. If `comps[i]` is not 0 at the start, `comps`, `j`, and `col` remain unchanged. Therefore, after the execution, `comps` contains non-zero values for indices that are part of the cycle starting from `i` in the permutation, and `col` reflects the total number of unique cycles encountered during the process.***
