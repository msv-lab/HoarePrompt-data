Output State: **`if comps[p[j]]` is initially 0, then after the loop completes, `comps[j]` will be set to 1 for the last value of `j`, which is the last index accessed in the permutation `p`; if `comps[p[j]]` is not 0 at the start, the loop doesn't execute, and the values of `comps`, `j`, `col`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, with `comps` still having its first element as 1 and the rest as 0.**
