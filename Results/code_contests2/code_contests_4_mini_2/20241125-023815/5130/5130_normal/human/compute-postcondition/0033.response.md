According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. For the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` must still be equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[p[j]]` is replaced with `col`, so `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0 if `col` is not equal to 0. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the state of `comps[p[j]]` needs to be adjusted back to 0, which implies that `col` must be set to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers based on the input; `comps[p[j]]` is 0; `j` is updated to `p[j]`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`**
