The value of `col` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `col` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `col` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `b`, `comps`, `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `p` is a list of integers representing the permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers based on the input, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 1, `i` is 0**
