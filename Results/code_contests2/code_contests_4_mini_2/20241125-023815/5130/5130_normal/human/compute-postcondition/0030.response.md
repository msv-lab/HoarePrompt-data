According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. For the loop to execute again, it is necessary that `comps[p[j]]` remains equal to 0.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `comps[p[j]]` is currently 0. However, since `j` has been updated to `p[j]`, we must ensure that the value of `j` (which is now `p[j]`) points to an index in `comps` where `comps[p[j]]` is still 0 for the next iteration.

To ensure that `comps[p[j]]` is 0, we need to confirm that the current value of `j` leads to a valid index in the `comps` array that has not been modified by the loop body. Since we do not have any specific information about the contents of `comps` or how the loop body modifies them, we can infer that as long as `comps[p[j]]` is 0, the loop can continue to execute.

Therefore, since `comps[p[j]]` is already 0, there are no changes needed to the states in order for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers based on the input; `comps[p[j]]` is 0; `j` has been updated to `p[j]`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.**
