The variable `j` is updated by assigning it the value of `p[j]`. The previous value of `j` was `p[p[0]]`, so now `j` takes on the new value of `p[p[j]]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing the permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers based on the input; `comps[j]` is set to 1; `col` is 1; `i` is 0; `j` is updated to `p[p[j]]`; `comps[p[j]]` is set to 0.**
