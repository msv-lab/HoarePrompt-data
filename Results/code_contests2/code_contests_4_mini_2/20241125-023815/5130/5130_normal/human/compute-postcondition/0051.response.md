According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` compared to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last valid index checked during the iterations. Since `i` was the last index checked, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, if `i` was the last index checked in the previous iteration, it implies that `i` is currently `n - 1` just before the loop is to execute again. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n`, which would lead to the loop terminating since `i` cannot be less than `n`.

Hence, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be set to `n`. No other states need to be adjusted as `col`, `comps`, and `p` remain unchanged during the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `comps` is a list of integers where `comps[i]` is initially 0, `i` is `n`**.
