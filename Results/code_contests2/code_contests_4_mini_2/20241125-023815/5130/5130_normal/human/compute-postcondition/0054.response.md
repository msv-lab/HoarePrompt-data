The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `p`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\). The parameter `p` is a list of integers that represents a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. Additionally, there is a parameter `b`, which is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with a length equal to `n`. 

The function does not have a specified return value provided in the output description. Therefore, we need to analyze any potential return conditions based on the provided input constraints. 

If we break down the expected functionality based on the information given, we can summarize:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` which is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones with length `n`. The specific output or return value of the function is not provided.**
