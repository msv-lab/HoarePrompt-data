Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers based on the input, `comps` is a list of integers where `comps[i]` is updated to `col` (which is incremented by 1) if it was initially 0, indicating the start of a new component. The variable `j` will reflect the last index accessed in the permutation `p` during the while loop, with the final value of `comps[j]` also updated to `col`. If `comps[i]` was not 0 at the start, the values of `comps`, `j`, `col`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `comps` retains all its original values, specifically with `comps[i]` still being 0 and all other elements remaining unchanged.***
