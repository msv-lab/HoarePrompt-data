The code assigns the value of `i` to `j`. However, since there is an error indicating "Index out of bounds for list `comps`," it suggests that before the execution of this line, there was an attempt to access an index in the list `comps` that does not exist, leading to the error. Consequently, the current state of the variables is not altered, and the execution cannot proceed. Therefore, the output state reflects that the error persists.

Output State: **Error: Index out of bounds for list `comps`**
