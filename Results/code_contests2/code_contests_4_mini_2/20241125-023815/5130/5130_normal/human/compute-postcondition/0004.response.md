The value of `col` is assigned to 0. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `b`, `comps`) remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the new value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing the permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is now a list of integers based on the input; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros; `col` is 0**
