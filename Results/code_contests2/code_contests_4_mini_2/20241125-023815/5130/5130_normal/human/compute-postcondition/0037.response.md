The value of `col` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `col` is unknown as it is not provided in the initial state. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers based on the input, `comps` is a list of integers where `comps[i]` is initially 0, `col` has increased by 1, and `i` is equal to `n`.
