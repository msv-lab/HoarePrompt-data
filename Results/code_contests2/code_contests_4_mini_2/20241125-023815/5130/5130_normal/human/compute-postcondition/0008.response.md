`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, where `i` is 0 and `col` is 1. Therefore, `comps[0]` will now be equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing the permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers based on the input; `comps` is now a list where the first element is 1 and the rest are zeros; `col` is 1; `i` is 0.
