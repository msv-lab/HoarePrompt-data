Output State: **`comps` will contain non-zero values for indices that are part of distinct cycles in the permutation `p`, where each unique cycle will be assigned a distinct value in `comps` corresponding to `col`. The variable `col` will equal the total number of unique cycles found in the permutation. If `comps[i]` was not 0 at the start, then `comps`, `j`, and `col` remain unchanged. If `n` is 0 or less than 1, or if `p` does not represent a valid permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`, the loop will not execute, and `comps` will remain a list of zeros, `col` will remain 0, and `n` will be unchanged.**
