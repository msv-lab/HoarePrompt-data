The code assigns the value of `col` to `comps[i]`. However, since `i` is equal to `n`, which is outside the valid index range of the list `comps` (as it should be between 0 and `n-1`), this assignment will lead to an index error. Therefore, the output state indicates that there is an issue due to accessing an out-of-bounds index in the list.

Output State: **Error: Index out of bounds for list `comps`**
