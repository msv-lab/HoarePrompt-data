The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The state of `j` is now used to determine which index in `comps` is being updated, but the previous values of `comps` and `col` are not specified. Therefore, the output state is that `comps[j]` is updated to `col`, and the specific values of `comps` and `col` are not known.

Output State: **`comps[j]` is updated to `col`**
