The function accepts a list `p` representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones. It computes the number of connected components in the permutation represented by `p` and checks if the list `b` contains any zeros. It returns 0 if there is only one connected component and the sum of `b` is 0; otherwise, it returns the number of connected components, incremented by 1 if the sum of `b` is 0. If all values in `comps` are initially non-zero, it will not count any components, and `col` will remain 0. The function may also encounter an error if the indices accessed in `p` go out of bounds.
