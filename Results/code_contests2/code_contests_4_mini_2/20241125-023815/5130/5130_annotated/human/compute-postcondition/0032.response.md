The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `col` is not specified in the initial state, we will not know its exact value. However, `comps[j]` is updated directly. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to `comps[j]`.

Output State: **`comps[j]` is updated to `col`**
