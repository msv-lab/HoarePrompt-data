The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i`, where `i` is `previous_i + 1`. Since `i` was updated to `previous_i + 1`, the exact value of `i` is now known as `previous_i + 1`. The variable `j` will take on this value. The states of other variables (`n`, `comps[i]`, and `col`) are not directly affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `comps[i]` is updated to `col`; `i` is `previous_i + 1`; `col` is increased by 1; `j` is `previous_i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `comps[i]` is updated to `col`; `i` is `previous_i + 1`; `col` is increased by 1; `j` is `previous_i + 1**
