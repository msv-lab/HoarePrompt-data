Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. If `comps[i]` is initially 0, `col` is incremented by 1 and `comps[i]` is updated to `col`; then for each iteration where `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `comps[j]` is also updated to `col` until `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0. If `p[j]` leads to an out-of-bounds index during the updates, it may result in an error, and `comps[j]` remains unchanged if `comps[p[j]]` is not 0 initially.***
