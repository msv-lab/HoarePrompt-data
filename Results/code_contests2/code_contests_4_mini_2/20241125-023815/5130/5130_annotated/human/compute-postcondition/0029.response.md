The variable `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `col` is not provided, but `comps[j]` will be updated accordingly. Other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the update to `comps[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is an index within the range of the list `comps`; `comps[i]` is updated to `col + 1`; `comps[j]` is updated to `col`**.
