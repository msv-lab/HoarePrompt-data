According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `comps[p[j]]`. The loop will execute as long as `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `comps[j]` is 1, meaning that `comps[p[j]]` must also be 1, as `j` is updated to `p[j]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `comps[p[j]]` must be 0. This means that `comps` at the position `p[j]` needs to be adjusted so that it reflects a value of 0 instead of 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length `n`; `comps[j]` is 0; `col` is 1; `j` is updated to `p[j]`**
