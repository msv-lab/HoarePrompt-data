Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `comps[i]` is updated to `col` if it was initially 0, and `col` is incremented by 1. The variable `j` is set to `i` and may be updated to point to `p[j]` while `comps[p[j]]` is 0, continuing until `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0. If there is a cycle in `p` that leads to an infinite loop, this condition is not handled, and the loop may execute indefinitely. If `comps[i]` was not 0 initially, then `comps[i]` remains unchanged and `j` does not update.***
