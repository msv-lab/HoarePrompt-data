The value of `n` is assigned the value returned by `int(raw_input())`, which accepts input and converts it to an integer. Other variables `p` and `b` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is `n` as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n; and `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length n.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length n.**
