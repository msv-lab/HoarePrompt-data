According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. However, the state provided does not include the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration. Assuming that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, we need to adjust `i` accordingly to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

If `i` was at `n - 1` during the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` would need to be `n` and the loop would terminate. Therefore, we can conclude that we need to update `i` to be less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time. 

Thus, we will assume that `i` was `n - 1` at the end of the last iteration. We can adjust `i` to be `n` to indicate that the loop will not execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is n - 1**
