Output State: **`comps` contains non-zero values at indices that are part of the same component as the indices where `comps[i]` was initially 0, with each component being assigned a unique value from `1` to `col`. If `comps[i]` is initially non-zero, then `i` remains unchanged and does not contribute to `col`. If `p[j]` leads to an out-of-bounds index during the updates, it results in an error. The loop does not execute if all values in `comps` are initially non-zero, and in that case, `col` remains 0 and `comps` remains unchanged.**
