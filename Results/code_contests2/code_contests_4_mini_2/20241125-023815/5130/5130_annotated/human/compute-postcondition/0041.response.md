The variable `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `col` has been previously increased by 1. The value of `j` is now `previous_i + 1`, and `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The variable `n` is a positive integer within the specified range, but its value does not directly affect the assignment.

Since `comps[j]` is updated to the current value of `col`, the output state reflects that. We do not have the specific values of `col`, `previous_i`, or `p[j]`, but the assignment will still occur.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `comps[j]` is updated to `col`.**
