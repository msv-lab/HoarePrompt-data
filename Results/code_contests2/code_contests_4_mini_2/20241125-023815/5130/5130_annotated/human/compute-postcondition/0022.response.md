The variable `col` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not specify the value of `col`, but it is understood that it is an integer variable. The previous values of other variables (`n` and `i`) are unaffected. Therefore, the output state indicates that `col` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is an index within the range of the list `comps`; `col` is increased by 1**
