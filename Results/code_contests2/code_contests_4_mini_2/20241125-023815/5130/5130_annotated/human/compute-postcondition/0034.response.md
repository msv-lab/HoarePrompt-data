Output State: **`if comps[p[j]] is 0 then comps[j]` is updated to `col`, `j` becomes `p[j]`, and this process continues until `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0. If `comps` has 0 at any index that `p[j]` points to, the loop will keep executing, potentially leading to an infinite loop if there is a cycle in `p`. If `comps[p[j]]` is not 0 initially, the loop does not execute and `comps[i]` is set to `col + 1`, while `j` remains unchanged.**
