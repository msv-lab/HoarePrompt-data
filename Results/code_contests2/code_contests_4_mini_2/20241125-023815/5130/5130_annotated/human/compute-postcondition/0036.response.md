According to the code, the loop will execute for each integer `i` starting from 0 up to `n - 1`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that it has been updated to point to the next value for the next iteration. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `n`.

Since `comps[i]` has been updated in the previous iteration, we assume `i` was incremented to `i + 1` for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `i + 1`, and `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `comps[i]` is updated to `col`, `i` is `previous_i + 1`**
