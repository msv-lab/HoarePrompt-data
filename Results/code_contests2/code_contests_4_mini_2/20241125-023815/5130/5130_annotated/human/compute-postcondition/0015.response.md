According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `comps[p[j]]`. The loop will execute as long as `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `comps[j]` is 1, which means `comps[p[j]]` must also be 1 because `j` has been updated to `p[j]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `comps[p[j]]` must remain 0. This means we need to ensure that `p[j]` points to an index whose corresponding value in `comps` is still 0.

Since `comps[p[j]]` is currently 1 after the last iteration, we need to adjust the state such that `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `comps` to reflect that `comps[p[j]]` has been modified to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length `n`; `comps[p[j]]` is 0; `col` is 1; `j` is updated to `p[j]`**
