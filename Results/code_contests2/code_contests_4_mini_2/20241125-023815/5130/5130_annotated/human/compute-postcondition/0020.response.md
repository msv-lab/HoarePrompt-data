Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is an index within the range of the list `comps`, which consists of integers initialized to zero. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `col` is incremented by 1, and `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `j` is initialized to `i`, and for every index visited through the permutation `p`, `comps[j]` is also set to `col` until a non-zero value is encountered in `comps` for the corresponding index. If `comps[p[0]]` is already non-zero at the start, `j` remains 0 and the loop does not execute. Thus, after execution, `comps` will have non-zero values at indices that are part of the same component as `i`, while all other indices will remain zero.***
