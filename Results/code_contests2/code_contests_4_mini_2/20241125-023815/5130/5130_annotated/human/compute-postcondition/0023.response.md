`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, which has been increased by 1. The value of `col` is now `col + 1`. The variable `n` remains within its range, and `i` is a valid index for the list `comps`. Therefore, after executing the code, the state of the variables is affected as follows: `comps[i]` is updated to `col + 1`, while `n` and `i` retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is an index within the range of the list `comps`; `comps[i]` is updated to `col + 1`**
