The code initializes a list `comps` with `n` elements, all set to `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, and `comps` is now created as a list of length `n`. The other variables `p` and `b` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length `n`; `comps` is a list of integers consisting of `n` zeros.**
