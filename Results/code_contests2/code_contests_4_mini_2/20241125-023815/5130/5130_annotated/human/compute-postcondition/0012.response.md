According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `p[0]`, and we know that `comps[j]` is set to 1, meaning `comps[p[j]]` is also 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. This means that `comps[p[j]]` must not have been set to 1 at the end of the last iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length `n`; `comps` has `comps[j]` set to 0; `col` is 1; `j` is `p[0]**
