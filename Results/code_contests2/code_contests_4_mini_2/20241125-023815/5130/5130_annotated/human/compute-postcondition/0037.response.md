The value of `col` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `col` is not given, but it is affected by the operation. The values of `n` and `comps[i]` are not directly changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `comps[i]` is updated to `col`; `i` is `previous_i + 1`; and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `comps[i]` is updated to `col`; `i` is `previous_i + 1`; and `col` is increased by 1.**
