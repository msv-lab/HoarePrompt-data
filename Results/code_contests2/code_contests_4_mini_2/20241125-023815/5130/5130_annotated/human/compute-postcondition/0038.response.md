The line of code updates the `comps` list at index `i` with the value of `col`. The previous value of `col` is unknown but is increased by 1 in the previous state. The value of `i` is also updated to `previous_i + 1`, meaning `i` takes the value of the previous index incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `comps[i]` is updated to `col`; `i` is `previous_i + 1`; `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `comps[i]` is updated to `col`; `i` is `previous_i + 1`; `col` is increased by 1.**
