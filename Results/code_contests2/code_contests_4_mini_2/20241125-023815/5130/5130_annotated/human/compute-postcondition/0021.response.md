According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the positive integer `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an index within the range of `comps`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, if `i` is at its maximum value of `n - 1`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n`. 

Since `i` is currently within the range, we assume `i` can be adjusted to `i + 1` for the next iteration. Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to state that `i` is incremented.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is an index within the range of the list `comps`, `i` is incremented by 1**
