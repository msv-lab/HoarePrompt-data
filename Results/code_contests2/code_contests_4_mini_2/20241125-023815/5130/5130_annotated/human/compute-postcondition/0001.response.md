The variable `p` is assigned a list comprehension that processes the input received from `raw_input()`. Each value `v` in the input string is converted to an integer, decremented by 1, and then collected into the list `p`. The initial state indicates that `p` will now hold a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1` (since `int(v) - 1` converts the values from the range 1 to `n` to a range from 0 to `n-1`). The lists `b` and `n` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length n.**
