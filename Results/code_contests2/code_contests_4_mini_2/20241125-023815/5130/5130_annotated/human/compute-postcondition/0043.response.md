The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, and it is specified that `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `j` or `p[j]`, so we cannot determine the new value of `j`. However, the state of other variables is unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `comps[j]` is updated to `col`; `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0; `j` is now equal to `p[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `comps[j]` is updated to `col`; `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0; `j` is now equal to `p[j]**
