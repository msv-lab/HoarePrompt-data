The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The previous state indicates that `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, and `j` is now equal to `p[j]`. Therefore, `j` will take on the value of `p[j]`, but the specific value of `p[j]` is not provided in the initial state. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `comps[j]` is updated to `col`; `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0; `j` is now equal to `p[j]**
