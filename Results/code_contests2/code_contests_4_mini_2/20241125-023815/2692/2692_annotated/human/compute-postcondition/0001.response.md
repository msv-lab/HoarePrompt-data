`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input()` accepts a string input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` must be an even integer within the range of 2 to 50, and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50**
