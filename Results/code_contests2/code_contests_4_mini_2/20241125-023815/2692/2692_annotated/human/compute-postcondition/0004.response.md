The code snippet `print('YES')` outputs the string 'YES' to the console. It does not change any values of the existing variables `n` or `digits`. The conditions for the sums of the halves of `digits` are already stated to be satisfied. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `digits`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `digits` is a list of integers, and the output is 'YES'**
