The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on the constraints that `n` is an even integer in the range of 2 to 50, and the ticket number must be a positive integer with exactly `n` digits consisting solely of the digits 4 and 7. Based on these constraints, the function processes the ticket number and returns a specific result. However, the exact output based on the ticket number is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes a ticket number that is a positive integer with exactly n digits consisting only of the digits 4 and 7, where n is an even integer between 2 and 50. The exact output based on the ticket number is not specified.**
