The `digits` variable is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().strip())`, which means it will convert the input from `raw_input()` into a list of integers. The initial state of `n` does not affect the assignment to `digits`, as `n` is not used in this line of code. The output state is thus dependent on the input provided. Since other variable states are not affected, the output state reflects the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `digits` is a list of integers from input**
