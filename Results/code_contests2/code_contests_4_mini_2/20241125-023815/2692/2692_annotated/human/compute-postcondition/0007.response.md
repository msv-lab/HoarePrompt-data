Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `digits` is a list of integers. If the sum of the first half of `digits` (up to `n / 2`) is equal to the sum of the second half of `digits` (from `n / 2 + n % 2` to `n`), the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'. This includes cases where `n` is the minimum value of 2, as well as the maximum value of 50, ensuring that both halves are correctly evaluated even when `n` is at its boundaries.***
