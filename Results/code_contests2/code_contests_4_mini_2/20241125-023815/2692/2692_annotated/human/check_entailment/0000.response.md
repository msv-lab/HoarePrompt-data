Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if a ticket number is a "lucky" ticket based on the problem description. Here are the issues with the code:

1. **Checking for Lucky Digits**: The program does not verify if all digits in the ticket number are either '4' or '7'. According to the problem description, a ticket is considered lucky only if it is made up entirely of lucky digits. The code currently skips this essential check.

2. **Incorrect Indexing for Sum Calculation**: The code calculates the sums of the two halves of the digits incorrectly. The second half's sum is computed starting from `n / 2 + n % 2`, which is incorrect. It should start from `n / 2` to `n`, as the first half consists of indices from `0` to `n/2 - 1`, and the second half consists from `n/2` to `n - 1`.

3. **Output Logic**: The output logic only checks if the sums of the two halves are equal, without considering the lucky digits condition.

To illustrate, consider the ticket number "1234":
- The digits contain numbers other than 4 and 7, so it should return "NO", but the current logic would not check for this case and might incorrectly compute a sum.

Therefore, the program fails to handle the requirements of the problem as described.
