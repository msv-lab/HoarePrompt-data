The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` from input, which must be an even integer between 2 and 50. It then reads a list of integers from input, representing the digits of a ticket number. The function checks if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2 or greater than 50, nor does it validate that the digits consist only of 4s and 7s, which are implied in the annotations but not enforced in the code.
