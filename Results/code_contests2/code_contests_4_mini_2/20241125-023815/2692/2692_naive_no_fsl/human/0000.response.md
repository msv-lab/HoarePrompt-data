Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement for checking if a ticket is lucky. Specifically, it fails to check if the ticket number consists solely of the lucky digits (4 and 7). 

For example, consider the input:

```
4
1234
```

1. The length of the ticket number is 4 (which is even).
2. The ticket number is `1234`, which contains digits other than 4 and 7 (specifically, it contains 1 and 3).
3. The program will incorrectly output "NO" since the sum of the first half (1 + 2 = 3) and the sum of the second half (3 + 4 = 7) are not equal, without checking if the digits are all lucky.

According to the problem description, the ticket must be a lucky number (composed only of 4s and 7s) before checking the sums of the halves. The program does not account for this requirement, hence it is incorrect.
