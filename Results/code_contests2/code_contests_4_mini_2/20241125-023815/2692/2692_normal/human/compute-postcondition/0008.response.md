Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `digits` is a positive integer represented as a string of digits of length exactly `n`, containing only the digits 0-9. If the sum of the first half of the integers in `digits` (from index 0 to `n/2 - 1`) is equal to the sum of the second half of the integers in `digits` (from index `n/2 + n % 2` to `n - 1`), the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.***
