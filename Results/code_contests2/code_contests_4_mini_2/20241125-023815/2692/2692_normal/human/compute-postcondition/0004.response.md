The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state mentions that `n` is an even integer within the specified range and that `digits` has a certain structure based on the condition provided. However, the values of `n` and `digits` do not change as a result of this print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `digits` along with the return of the print action.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `digits` is a map object containing the integers from the input, and the output is 'YES'.**
