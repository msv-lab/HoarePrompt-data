Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and `digits` is a map object containing the integers from the input. If the sum of the first half of the integers in `digits` (up to `n/2`) is equal to the sum of the second half of the integers in `digits` (from `n/2 + n % 2` to `n`), the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.***
