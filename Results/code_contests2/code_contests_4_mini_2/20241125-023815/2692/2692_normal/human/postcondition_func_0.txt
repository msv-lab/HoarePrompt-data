The function accepts an even integer `n` between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and a string of digits with a length of exactly `n`. It checks whether the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include handling inputs where `n` is not an even integer or is outside the specified range, which are not addressed in the code. Additionally, if the input for `digits` does not match the expected format, the function may raise an error.
