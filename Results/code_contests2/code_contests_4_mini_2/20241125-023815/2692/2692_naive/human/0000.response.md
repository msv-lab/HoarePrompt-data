Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement for determining if a ticket is "lucky." 

Here are the issues with the current implementation:

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The program does not check if the ticket number consists only of the digits 4 and 7 (i.e., it does not verify if the number is a "lucky number"). A ticket must be a lucky number before checking the sums of its halves.

2. **Sum Comparison**: The code incorrectly slices the `digits` list when comparing the sums. The expression `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]` incorrectly includes the middle digit when `n` is even. The correct slicing should be `digits[n // 2:]` to get the second half of the digits.

To illustrate these issues, consider the input:
```
4
4744
```
- The ticket number is a lucky number since it contains only 4s and 7s.
- The sums of both halves are equal (4 + 7 = 11 for the first half and 4 + 4 = 8 for the second half).
- The program would output "NO" incorrectly because it does not check for lucky digits and has an incorrect slicing of the list.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
