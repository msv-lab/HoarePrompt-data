Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly computes the maximum value of `x` during the operations. Instead of tracking the maximum value of `x`, the program only keeps the final value of `x` and resets it to `0` if it goes negative. 

### Example Case Where It Fails:
Consider the input:
```
5
IIDDD
```

Expected behavior based on the problem description:
- Start with `x = 0`.
- After first `I`: `x = 1`.
- After second `I`: `x = 2`.
- After first `D`: `x = 1`.
- After second `D`: `x = 0`.
- After third `D`: `x = -1` (but we should track the maximum, which is `2`).

However, the program will end up outputting `0` as it resets the value of `x` to `0` when it goes negative instead of keeping track of the maximum value reached.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirement of finding the maximum value taken by `x`, leading to an incorrect implementation.
