The code decrements `result` by 1. The previous value of `result` is 0, so after execution, `result` becomes -1. The states of the other variables (`S`, `N`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string of length `N`, `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `result` is -1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `S` is not 'I'.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N`, `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `result` is -1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `S` is not 'I'**
