The value of `N` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input string and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of characters 'I' and 'D', `N` is an input integer.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of characters 'I' and 'D', `N` is an input integer**
