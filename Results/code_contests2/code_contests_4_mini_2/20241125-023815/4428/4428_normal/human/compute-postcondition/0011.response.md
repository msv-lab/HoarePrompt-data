The value of `result` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `result` can either be 1 or -1, so after execution, `result` becomes either 0 (if it was 1) or -2 (if it was -1). The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string of length at least 2; `result` is either 0 or -2; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length at least 2; `result` is either 0 or -2; `i` is 1**
