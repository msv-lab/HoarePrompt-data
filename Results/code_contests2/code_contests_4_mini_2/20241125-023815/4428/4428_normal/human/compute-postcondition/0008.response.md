Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N`, where `N` is greater than or equal to 0. If the character at index `i` (which is 0) of `S` is 'I', then `result` is increased by 1, making it 1. If the character at index `i` is not 'I', then `result` is decreased by 1, resulting in -1. Thus, `result` will be either 1 or -1 depending on the character at the first index of `S`.***
