The value of `result` is incremented by 1. Since `result` can either be 1 or -1, after the execution, it will be either 2 or 0 respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string of length at least 2, `result` is either 2 or 0, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length at least 2; `result` is either 2 or 0; `i` is 1**
