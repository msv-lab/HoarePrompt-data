Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `S` consisting of 'I' and 'D' characters and calculates a net count based on the occurrences of 'I' (increment) and 'D' (decrement). It returns this net count, ensuring it is non-negative by resetting it to 0 if the result is negative. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `N` (the length of `S`) is 0, which would lead to a potential input error since `raw_input()` is called without any prior validation.**
