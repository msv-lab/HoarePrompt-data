The value of `N` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, the output state reflects that `N` is now an input integer. The variable `S` is not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'**
