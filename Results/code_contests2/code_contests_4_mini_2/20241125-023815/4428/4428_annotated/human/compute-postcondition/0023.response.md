The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on the predefined constraints where `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\), and `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. The function's output is determined based on the specific conditions related to the values of `N` and `S`, which are not explicitly detailed in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized based on its operational context.

Functionality: **The function processes a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string S of length N consisting of 'I' and 'D', returning a result based on these inputs.**
