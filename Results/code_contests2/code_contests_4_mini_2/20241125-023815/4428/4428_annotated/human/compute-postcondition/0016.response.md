Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `S` is a string of length `N`, and `i` is equal to `i + 1`. If the character at index `i` in the string `S` is 'I', then `result` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `result` is decreased by 1. This accounts for the situation where `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the string, as well as the edge cases where `S[i]` may be any character other than 'I'.***
