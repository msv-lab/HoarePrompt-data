Postcondition: ***If `N` is greater than 0, `S` is a string, and `result` is equal to the difference between the count of 'I' and 'D' characters in `S`, the function ensures that if `result` is negative, it is set to 0. If `N` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `result` remains 0. Overall, `result` is non-negative after the execution of the program fragment.***
