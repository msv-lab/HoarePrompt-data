Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly parse the arithmetic expressions in the form `(a+b)/c`. Instead, it attempts to read input directly as a float, which does not match the expected input format. This will lead to incorrect behavior for several reasons:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program tries to read each coordinate as a float directly, which will fail for the input format `(a+b)/c`. This will raise a `ValueError` when it encounters the parentheses and operators.

2. **Mathematical Evaluation**: The expressions need to be evaluated to compute the actual coordinates. The program does not include any logic to evaluate the arithmetic expression given in the required format. 

3. **Counting Logic**: The way the program counts occurrences of each coordinate is based on the float representation of the input, which is not correct since the input is not being evaluated as intended.

For example, if we input:
```
1
(1+1)/2
```
The program will throw an error because it cannot convert `(1+1)/2` into a float.

Thus, since the program does not handle the specified input format correctly and does not perform the required evaluations, it is incorrect as per the problem description.
