The provided program does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program attempts to read the arithmetic expression directly as a floating-point number with `e = float(input())`. However, the expressions are not in a format that can be directly converted to float. The input should be parsed and evaluated to produce a valid coordinate.

2. **Expression Evaluation**: There is no implementation for parsing and evaluating the arithmetic expression of the form `(a+b)/c`. The program simply tries to treat the input as a float, which will lead to incorrect behavior.

3. **Counting Occurrences**: The counting logic assumes that the coordinates have already been computed and stored in `test_list`. However, since the expressions are not evaluated correctly, the counts will not reflect the actual number of ships at the same coordinates.

4. **Precision Issues**: Using float to represent the results of the arithmetic expression may lead to precision issues. It is better to work with integers or a precise representation of the numbers if applicable.

Given these points, we can identify a specific case where the program fails:

**Example Case**:
If the input is:
```
1
(1+1)/1
```
The expected output should be `1` (since there is only one ship), but the program would likely fail to parse the input correctly and return an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is not functioning as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
