According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. If `test_list` contains at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `my_list` is empty and `test_list` is also empty, adjustments need to be made to ensure the loop can run. 

For the loop to be executed, `test_list` must have at least 1 element, and `i` should be defined to refer to the first element of `test_list`. 

State: **`my_list` is empty, `test_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `test_list`**
