Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `m` from input, which represents the number of subsequent float values to read. It collects these float values into a list called `test_list`. If `m` is between 1 and 200000, it counts the occurrences of each float value from `test_list` and stores these counts in a separate list called `my_list`. Finally, it prints the counts as a space-separated string. If `m` is less than 1 or greater than 200000, the function does not execute the counting loop, leaving `my_list` empty, and prints nothing. There is also no error handling for invalid inputs or zero counts.**
