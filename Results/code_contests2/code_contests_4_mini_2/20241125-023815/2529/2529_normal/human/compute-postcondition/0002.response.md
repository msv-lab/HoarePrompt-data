According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `m` must be greater than 0. Since `m` is given as an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, it is already guaranteed to be at least 1, which ensures that the loop will execute. 

The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop. The `test_list` is currently empty, but that does not affect the execution of the loop itself. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.
- `m` remains as is since it satisfies the condition.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is 0**
