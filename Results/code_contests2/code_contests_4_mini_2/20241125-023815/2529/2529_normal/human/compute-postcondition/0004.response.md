The line `test_list.append(e)` appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The initial state indicates that `e` is a float input, and `test_list` is not previously defined in the initial state provided, so it will be created as a new list. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is 0, `e` is a float input, and `test_list` now contains the float value `e`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is 0, `e` is a float input, and `test_list` contains the float value `e`**
