The code initializes `test_list` as an empty list. The value of `m` remains unchanged and is still an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, and `test_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, and `test_list` is an empty list**.
