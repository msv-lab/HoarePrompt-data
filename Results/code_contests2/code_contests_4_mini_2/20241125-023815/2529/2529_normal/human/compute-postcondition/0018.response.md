According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. The loop iterates over each element in `test_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element of `test_list`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `test_list` must contain at least 3 elements so that there is a third element for `i` to take on.

Given that `i` is currently the second element of `test_list`, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be updated to the third element of `test_list`. Therefore, the conditions for the states must be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`my_list` contains the count of the first element of `test_list` and the count of the second element of `test_list`, `test_list` contains at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `test_list`**
