The variable `m` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `m` is already defined as an integer within the range of 1 to 200000, the output state will reflect that the new value of `m` is an input integer within this specified range. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000**
