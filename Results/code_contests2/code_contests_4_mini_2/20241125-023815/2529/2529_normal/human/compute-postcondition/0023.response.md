The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with the constraint that `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200000, and each jump coordinate is given as a valid arithmetic expression of the form (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers with up to two decimal digits. The function processes these jump coordinates and presumably returns a result based on this input. However, since there are no specific cases or return values provided in the output description, we cannot detail those aspects.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with an integer `m` within the specified range and valid arithmetic expressions for jump coordinates, but no specific outputs or return values are defined.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and operates with an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 200000) and valid arithmetic expressions for jump coordinates, but does not specify return values.**
