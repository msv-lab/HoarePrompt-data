The code appends the count of the element `i` (which is the third element of `test_list`) to `my_list`. The previous values of the affected variables are `my_list`, which contains counts of the first and second elements of `test_list`, and `test_list`, which has at least three elements. The value of `i` is the third element of `test_list`, and its count is calculated using `test_list.count(i)`. 

The output state reflects that `my_list` is updated with the count of the third element of `test_list`, but the exact value of that count is not known unless the specific content of `test_list` is provided. Therefore, the output state will indicate the changes without specifying exact counts.

Output State: **`my_list` is updated with the count of the third element of `test_list`, `test_list` contains at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `test_list`**
