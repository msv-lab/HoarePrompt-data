The code appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The initial state does not specify the previous contents of `test_list`, but since `e` is a float input, we can say that `test_list` will now contain at least one element which is the value of `e`. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is 1, `e` is a float input, and `test_list` now includes the float value `e`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is 1, `e` is a float input, and `test_list` now includes the float value `e`**
