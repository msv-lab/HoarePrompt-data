According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. Since `m` is greater than 0, we know that `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers based on user input, meaning it has at least 1 element. Therefore, the loop can execute starting with the first element of `test_list`. At the beginning of the loop, `i` should be the first element of `test_list`, and `my_list` is still empty at this point.

State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains m floating-point numbers, `my_list` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `test_list`**
