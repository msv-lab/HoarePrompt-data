Output State: **`my_list` contains the counts of each unique element in `test_list`, corresponding to their occurrences in the input list. If `m` is greater than 0, the loop executes `m` times and `my_list` will have `m` elements. If `m` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `my_list` remains empty.**
