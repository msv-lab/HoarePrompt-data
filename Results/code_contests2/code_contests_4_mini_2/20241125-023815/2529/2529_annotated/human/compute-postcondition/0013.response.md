The variable `my_list` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of `m` determine whether `test_list` contains floating-point numbers or remains empty. However, the execution of the provided code snippet does not modify `my_list`. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `m` and `my_list`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, then `test_list` contains m floating-point numbers based on user input and its length is equal to m; `my_list` is an empty list.**
