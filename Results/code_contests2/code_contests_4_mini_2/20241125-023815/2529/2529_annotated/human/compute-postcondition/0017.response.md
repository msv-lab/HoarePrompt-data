The `append` method adds the count of the occurrences of `i` in `test_list` to `my_list`. The value of `i` is the second element of `test_list`, and since `test_list` contains at least 2 floating-point numbers, the count of `i` will be a non-negative integer. The previous values of `my_list` are not specified, but it will have one additional element after the execution. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `my_list` and the count of `i`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `test_list` contains at least 2 floating-point numbers, `my_list` is updated to include the count of `i` in `test_list`, `i` is the second element of `test_list`**
