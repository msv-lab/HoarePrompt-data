The code appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The variable `e` is a floating-point number based on user input, but the specific value of `e` is unknown. The values of the other variables, `m` and `i`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `test_list` now includes the floating-point number `e`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `test_list` now includes the floating-point number `e`**
