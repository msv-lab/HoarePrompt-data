According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment up to `m - 1`. Since `test_list` is empty, it does not influence the loop's execution, but it will remain empty throughout the loop iterations.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `m` must be greater than 0, and `i` must start at 0.

State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `test_list` is an empty list**
