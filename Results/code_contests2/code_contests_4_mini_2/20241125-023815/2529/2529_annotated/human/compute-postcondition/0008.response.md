According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1, and `i` should be increased to 2. 

State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `test_list` includes the floating-point number `e`**
