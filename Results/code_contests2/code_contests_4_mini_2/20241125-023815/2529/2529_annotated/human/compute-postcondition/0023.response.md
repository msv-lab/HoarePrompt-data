The function `func` accepts a parameter `m`. `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000. Additionally, each jump coordinate is represented as a string in the format "(a+b)/c", where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers with up to two decimal digits. The function does not explicitly specify any return output in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept an integer `m` and jump coordinates as strings formatted in a specific way. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000) and jump coordinates as strings in the format "(a+b)/c" where a, b, and c are positive integers with up to two decimal digits.**
