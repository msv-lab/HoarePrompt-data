The code initializes `test_list` as an empty list. The value of `m` does not affect this operation since it is not being used in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the state of `m` remains unchanged, and the output reflects the creation of `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer within the specified range, `test_list` is an empty list**
