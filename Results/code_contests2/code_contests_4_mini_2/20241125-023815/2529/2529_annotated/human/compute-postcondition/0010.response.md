The code appends the floating-point number `e` to the list `test_list`. The previous values of the variables indicate that `m` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2, but these values do not affect the execution of the append operation. The state of `test_list` changes to include the new element `e`. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `test_list` includes the floating-point number `e` appended to it.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `test_list` includes the floating-point number `e`**
