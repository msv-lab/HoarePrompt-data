The variable `e` is assigned the value `float(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `float` converts it to a floating-point number. The previous values of `m`, `i`, and `test_list` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `test_list` includes the floating-point number `e` as an input float.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `test_list` includes the floating-point number `e` as an input float**
