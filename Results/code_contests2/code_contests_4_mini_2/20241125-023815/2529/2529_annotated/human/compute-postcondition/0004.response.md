The code appends the value of `e` to `test_list`. The initial state indicates that `test_list` is empty, so after execution, `test_list` will contain one element, which is the floating-point number `e` provided by the user. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `test_list` contains the floating-point number `e`, and `e` is a floating-point number based on user input**.
