The function accepts an integer input `m` from the user, which determines how many floating-point numbers will be inputted next. It collects these numbers into a list called `test_list`. It then creates another list, `my_list`, which contains the count of occurrences for each number in `test_list`. Finally, it prints the counts as a space-separated string. If `m` is 0 or negative, no input is collected, and the function will output an empty string. The function does not handle any exceptions that may arise from invalid input types or values.
