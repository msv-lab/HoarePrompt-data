To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its annotations carefully.

### Code Analysis

```python
def func():
    m = int(input())
    test_list = []
    for i in range(m):
        e = float(input())
        
        test_list.append(e)
        
    my_list = []
    for i in test_list:
        my_list.append(test_list.count(i))
        
    print(' '.join(map(str, my_list)))
```

### Problem Description

The problem requires us to calculate how many ships will end up at the same coordinate after a jump, given the coordinates in the form of the arithmetic expression `(a+b)/c`. 

### Key Observations

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The code reads `m`, the number of ships, and then reads `m` lines of input which are expected to be in the form of `(a+b)/c`. However, the code attempts to convert the input directly to `float` without evaluating the arithmetic expression. This is a critical error.

2. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - The arithmetic expression needs to be evaluated to get a floating-point number representing the jump coordinate. The current code does not perform this evaluation and instead tries to convert the raw expression string to a float, which will lead to a `ValueError`.

3. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The code correctly counts occurrences of each unique coordinate but fails to evaluate the coordinates properly. Thus, even if the counting logic was correct, it would never produce valid results because the input parsing and evaluation are incorrect.

### Potential Edge Cases
- For any input like `(1+1)/2`, the program will raise an error because it tries to convert the string `(1+1)/2` to a float directly, leading to failure even for valid arithmetic expressions.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not correctly evaluate the arithmetic expressions as required by the problem description, it cannot produce the correct output. The failure to handle the input format and evaluate it correctly leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
