The code prints 'YES', which does not change the values of the existing variables. The values of `p`, `a`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's', and the output is 'YES'.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's', and the output is 'YES'**.
