Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and if `i` is one of 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program prints 'YES' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the state of `a` remains unchanged at 'tstr123' and no action is taken.***
