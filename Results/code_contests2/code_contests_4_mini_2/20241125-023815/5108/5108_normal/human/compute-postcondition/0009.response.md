The variable `a` is assigned the value `'tstr123'`. The previous value of `a` was also `'tstr123'`, so there is no change in the state of `a`. The other variables `p`, `i`, and the output variable are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for those variables.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's', and the output is 'YES'**
