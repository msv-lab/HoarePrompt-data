The code prints 'NO' to the output. The values of `a` and `p` remain unchanged, and there are no modifications to the state of these variables. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', and `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is not equal to 'tstr123', and `p` remains unchanged; 'NO' is printed**
