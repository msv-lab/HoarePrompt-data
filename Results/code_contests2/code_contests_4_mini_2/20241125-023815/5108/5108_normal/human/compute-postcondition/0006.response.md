Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is assigned the value 'tstr123', `i` is 't', and the output is 'YES' if `i` is one of 'H', 'Q', or '9'. There are no changes to `p` or any other variables, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when the condition is satisfied. If `i` is not one of these characters, the program does not execute the code within the if block.***
