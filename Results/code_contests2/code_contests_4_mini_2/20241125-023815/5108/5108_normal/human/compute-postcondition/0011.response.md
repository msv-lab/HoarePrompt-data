Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is assigned the value 'tstr123', and if `i` is one of 'H', 'Q', or '9', the output will be 'YES' and the execution will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not one of these values, the program will continue executing without producing any output related to this condition.***
