The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the other variables (`p`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables along with the printed message.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `a`, and the output is 'YES'**
