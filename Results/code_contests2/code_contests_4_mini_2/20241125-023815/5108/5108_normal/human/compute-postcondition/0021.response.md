Postcondition: ***If `a` contains at least one character that is 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program will print 'YES', assign `a` the value 'tstr123', and exit the loop after the first iteration. If `a` does not contain 'H', 'Q', or '9', the loop will iterate over all characters in `a`, leaving `p` unchanged and `a` as the original input string. If `a` is empty or does not contain any of the specified characters, the loop will not execute, and `p` and `a` will remain unchanged. After this, if `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', 'NO' is printed.***
