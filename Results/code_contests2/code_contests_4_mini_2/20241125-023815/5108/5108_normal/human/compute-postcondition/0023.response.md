Functionality: ** The function reads a string input from the user and checks if it contains the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and sets the variable `a` to 'tstr123'. If none are found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely based on user input. An edge case is that if the input is empty, the function will print 'NO' since the loop will not execute. Additionally, the variable `a` is reassigned to 'tstr123' but does not affect any output or further logic after the loop.**
