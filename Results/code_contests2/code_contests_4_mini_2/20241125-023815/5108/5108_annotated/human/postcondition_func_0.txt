The function accepts a string input from the user, checks if it contains the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9', and prints 'YES' if any of these characters are found. If none of these characters are found after checking all characters, it prints 'NO'. If the input is empty, it does not print anything. The logic for printing specific messages based on which character is found (like "H found" or "Q found") is not implemented; instead, it only prints 'YES' for any match and 'NO' for no matches.
