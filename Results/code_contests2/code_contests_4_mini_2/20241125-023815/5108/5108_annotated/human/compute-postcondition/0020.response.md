The code prints 'NO', which does not affect the values of the variables `a` and `p`. The variables retain their initial states. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a string that is not equal to 'tstr123', and `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters.

Output State: **`a` is a string that is not equal to 'tstr123', and `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters**
