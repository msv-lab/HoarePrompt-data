Postcondition: ***`a` is a string that may be 'tstr123' or any other string, and `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters. If `a` is not 'tstr123', the program prints 'NO'. If `a` is 'tstr123', nothing is printed. Additionally, if `a` contains at least one character among 'H', 'Q', or '9', it would have printed 'YES', assigned 'tstr123' to `a`, and exited the loop, but this situation is not part of the current if statement since it only checks if `a` is 'tstr123' or not. If `a` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the overall state of the program reflects these conditions.***
