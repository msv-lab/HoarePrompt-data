Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is a non-empty string. If the first character `i` of string `a` is either 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program prints 'YES', assigns 'tstr123' to `a`, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program will not execute the print statement or the assignment, and `a` remains unchanged.***
