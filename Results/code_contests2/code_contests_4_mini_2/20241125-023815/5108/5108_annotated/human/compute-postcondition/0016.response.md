Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and `i` is 't'. If `i` is one of the values 'H', 'Q', or '9', the output is 'YES', `a` remains 'tstr123', and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not one of these values, the output is not specified and no changes are made to `a`.***
