The function `func` accepts a parameter `p`. `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, where each character's ASCII code is between 33 (inclusive) and 126 (inclusive). The function evaluates the string `p` and checks for the presence of the characters 'H', 'Q', and '9'. 

The output is determined as follows:
- Case_1: If the string `p` contains the character 'H', the function returns "H found".
- Case_2: If the string `p` does not contain 'H' but contains 'Q', the function returns "Q found".
- Case_3: If the string `p` does not contain 'H' or 'Q' but contains '9', the function returns "9 found".
- Case_4: If none of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9' are present in the string `p`, the function returns "No special character found".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string `p` and return a specific message based on the presence of the characters 'H', 'Q', and '9'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter p, returns "H found" if 'H' is present, "Q found" if 'H' is not present but 'Q' is, "9 found" if neither 'H' nor 'Q' is present but '9' is, and "No special character found" if none of these characters are present.**
