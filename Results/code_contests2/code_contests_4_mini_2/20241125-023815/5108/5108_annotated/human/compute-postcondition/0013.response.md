The code executes a print statement that outputs 'YES'. The state of the variables `p`, `a`, and `i` remains unchanged after execution. Therefore, the output state is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 't', and the output is 'YES'.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 't', and the output is 'YES'**.
