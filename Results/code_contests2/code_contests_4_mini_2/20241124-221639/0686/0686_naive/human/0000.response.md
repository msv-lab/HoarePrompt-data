The provided program code is empty (`{}`). This means there is no implementation to verify against the problem description. Therefore, it cannot perform any logic to determine whether the number of commentary boxes can be adjusted (either built or demolished) to meet the requirements of the delegations.

Since there is no program logic, it does not handle any edge cases or potential inputs as described in the problem. As a result, the program fails to meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
