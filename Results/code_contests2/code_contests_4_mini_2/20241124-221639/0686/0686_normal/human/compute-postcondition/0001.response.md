The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` and `m` are positive integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12, and `a` and `b` are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100. The functionality of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided output, so we cannot derive specific return values or cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept the parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` within their defined constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m (positive integers within the range 1 to 10^12) and a, b (integers within the range 1 to 100).**
