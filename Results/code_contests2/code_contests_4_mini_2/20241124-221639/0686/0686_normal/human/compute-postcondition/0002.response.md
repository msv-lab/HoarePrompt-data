Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, and as it contains no executable code, it does not perform any actions or return any values. The annotations incorrectly suggest that the function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, which are not implemented in the code. Therefore, the function effectively does nothing. **
