The function accepts no parameters directly and is designed to work with constraints where `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12), and `a` and `b` are integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). However, the actual code does not implement any logic or return any values, making it effectively a placeholder with no functionality. Therefore, it does not perform any operations or yield any outputs.
