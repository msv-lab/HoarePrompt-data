The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates based on the constraints provided for `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^12, and `a` and `b` are integers in the range of 1 to 100. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, thus we cannot detail any specific return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to utilize the input constraints of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, though the exact return value based on these inputs is not described.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly, but operates on the constraints where n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12) and a and b are integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). The specific return value is not detailed.**
