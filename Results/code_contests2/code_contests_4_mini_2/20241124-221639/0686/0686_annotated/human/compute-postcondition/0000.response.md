The code snippet provided is an empty dictionary `{}`. This does not change the values of any variables, nor does it affect the initial state of `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^12, and `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100**
