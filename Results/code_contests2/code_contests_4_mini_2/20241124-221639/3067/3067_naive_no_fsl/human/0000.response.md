To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The problem requires counting the occurrences of the substring "AC" in specified ranges of a given string `S`. 

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads two integers, `N` (length of string) and `Q` (number of queries).
   - It then reads the string `S` of length `N`.
   - Finally, it reads `Q` pairs of integers representing the queries.

2. **Prefix Sum Array**:
   - The program initializes a prefix sum array `P` of size `N + 1`.
   - It iterates over the string `S` to populate the `P` array. 
     - If the substring `S[i-1:i+1]` (which is `S[i-1]` and `S[i]`) equals "AC", it increments the count in the prefix sum array.
     - Otherwise, it carries forward the previous count.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program computes the number of occurrences of "AC" by the difference `P[r-1] - P[l-1]`.

### Analysis of Correctness:

The logic in the code appears straightforward and should correctly count the occurrences of the substring "AC" for each query. However, we need to ensure that it handles all edge cases as specified in the problem description:

1. **Valid Indexing**: 
   - The queries are specified with `1 ≤ l_i < r_i ≤ N`, which means `l_i` is always less than `r_i`. Thus, the index `r-1` will always be greater than `l-1`, which is valid for the prefix sum array.

2. **Substrings Counting**:
   - The counting of "AC" is done correctly by checking pairs of characters in the string.
   - The prefix sum array `P` is correctly constructed to represent the cumulative count of "AC" up to each index.

3. **Inclusive Counting**: 
   - Since the queries specify inclusive end points, the prefix computation and the subtraction `P[r-1] - P[l-1]` effectively give the count of "AC" in the substring from `l` to `r`.

### Edge Cases:
Let's consider a few edge cases:
- If the string `S` is "AC" or "ACACAC", the program should accurately count the occurrences of "AC".
- If there are no occurrences of "AC" in the specified range, the program should return `0` correctly.
- The program should also handle large inputs efficiently due to the constraints, which it does.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code, it appears that it meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description without missing any edge cases. 

Thus, based on the analysis, the final result is:

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly counts occurrences of the substring "AC" for each query as specified in the problem description.
