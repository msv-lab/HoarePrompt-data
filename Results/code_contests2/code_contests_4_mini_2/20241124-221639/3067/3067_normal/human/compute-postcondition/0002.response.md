The list `P` is initialized with a size of `N + 1`, and all its elements are set to 0. This means that `P` will hold `N + 1` integers, all starting from 0. The values of `N`, `Q`, and `S` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `P` while maintaining the existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the string, `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries, `S` is a string input from the user, and `P` is a list with `N + 1` zeros.**
