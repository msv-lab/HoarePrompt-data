The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it is used to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and continues with the next iteration. The previous values of `N`, `i`, `Q`, `S`, and `P` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` is a list with `N + 1` zeros, and `P[0]` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
