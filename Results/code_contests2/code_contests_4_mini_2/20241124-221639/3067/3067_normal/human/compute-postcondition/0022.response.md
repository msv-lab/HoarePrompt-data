The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string input from the user, and `P[0]` is 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
