The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables or affect their states; it simply skips the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration if applicable. As such, the values of `N`, `i`, `Q`, `S`, and `P` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string input from the user, and `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
