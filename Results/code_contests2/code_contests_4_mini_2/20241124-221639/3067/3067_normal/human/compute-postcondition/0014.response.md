The statement `P[0] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the first element of the list `P`. Since `P` was initialized with `N + 1` zeros, the value at index `0` of `P` is already `0`, thus this assignment does not change the state of `P`. The other variables `N`, `i`, `Q`, and `S` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string input from the user, and `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros**
