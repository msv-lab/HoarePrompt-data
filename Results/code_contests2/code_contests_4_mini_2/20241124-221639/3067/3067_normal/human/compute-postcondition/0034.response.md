The code prints the result of the calculation `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`. Since `P` is an array initialized with zeros, every value in `P` is `0`. Thus, `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` will both equal `0`. 

Therefore, the expression evaluates to `0 - 0`, which is `0`. The values of `Q`, `l`, and `r` do not change the outcome of the print statement. 

The output state reflects that `P` is an array initialized with zeros of length `N + 1`, and the print statement results in `0`.

Output State: **`P` is an array initialized with zeros of length `N + 1`, `Q` is greater than 1, `l` and `r` are assigned values from input, and the function prints 0**
