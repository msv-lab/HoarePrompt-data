The variables `N` and `Q` are assigned values from the input, where `raw_input()` reads a line of input, and `map(int, ...)` converts the values to integers. The previous state of `N` and `Q` is unknown, but they will now hold integer values based on the input provided. Since `N` is the length of the string `S` and `Q` is the number of queries, the output state reflects that `N` is now an integer representing the length of the string, and `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the string, `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries**
