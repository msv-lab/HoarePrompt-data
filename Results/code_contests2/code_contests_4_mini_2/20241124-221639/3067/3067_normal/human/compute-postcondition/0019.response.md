Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string input from the user, and `P` is a list initialized with `N + 1` zeros. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` equals 'AC', then `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1] + 1`; otherwise, `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1]`. Thus, after execution, `P[1]` will be either `1` if the condition is met or `0` if not, depending on the value of `S` at the specified indices.**
