Output State: **`P` is an array initialized with zeros of length `N + 1`, `Q` is the number of queries executed, `l` and `r` are integers from input representing the range for each query. If `N` is greater than 0, the loop executes `Q` times and outputs the difference `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` for each query. If `Q` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `P` remains an array of zeros of length `N + 1`. Additionally, if `l` or `r` are out of bounds (less than 1 or greater than `N`), it could lead to an IndexError, which is not handled in the code.**
