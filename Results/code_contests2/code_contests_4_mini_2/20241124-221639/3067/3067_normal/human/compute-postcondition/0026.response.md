Postcondition: ***If `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1] + 1`. If `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is not equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` retains the value of `P[i - 1]`. In both cases, `N` remains greater than 1, `i` remains 2, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string input from the user, and `P` retains its initial state with `N + 1` zeros.***
