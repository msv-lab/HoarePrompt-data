Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `S` of length `N` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and an integer `Q` representing the number of queries. For each query, which consists of two integers `l` and `r`, it calculates and prints the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in the string `S` between the indices `l-1` and `r-1`. If `N` is 0, no occurrences are counted, and if `Q` is 0, no queries are processed. Additionally, the function does not handle potential out-of-bounds errors for `l` and `r`, which could lead to an `IndexError`.**
