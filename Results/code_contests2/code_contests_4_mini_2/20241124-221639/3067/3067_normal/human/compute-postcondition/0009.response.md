The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `P` is initialized with `N + 1` zeros, `P[i - 1]` is currently 0. Hence, `P[i]` becomes 0 + 1, which equals 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` is a list where `P[i]` becomes 1 and the previous element `P[i - 1]` is 0, and the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC'.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` is a list where `P[i]` is 1, `P[i - 1]` is 0, and the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC'**
