The values of `l` and `r` are assigned from the input, which is split into two integers. The initial state of `P`, `Q`, and other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `P` is an array initialized with zeros of length `N + 1`, `Q` is greater than 1, and `l` and `r` are assigned values from input.

Output State: **`P` is an array initialized with zeros of length `N + 1`, `Q` is greater than 1, and `l` and `r` are assigned values from input.**
