Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string input from the user, and `P` is a list initialized with `N + 1` zeros. If `i` is equal to 0, the first element of the list `P` remains 0, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, the program does not execute this block.***
