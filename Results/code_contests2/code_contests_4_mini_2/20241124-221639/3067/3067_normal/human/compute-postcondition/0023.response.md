Postcondition: ***If `i` is equal to 0, then `P[0]` is set to 0 and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `i` is any value other than 0, the program does not modify `P[0]` and moves on without executing the block. Thus, `N` remains greater than 1, `i` remains 2, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string input from the user, and `P` retains its initial state with `N + 1` zeros.***
