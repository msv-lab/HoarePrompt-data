Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string input from the user, and `P` is a list initialized with `N + 1` zeros. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` is set to 1, which indicates that there was an occurrence of 'AC' at this position. Otherwise, `P[i]` remains 0, reflecting that there was no occurrence of 'AC' at this position. In either case, `P[i - 1]` remains unchanged.***
