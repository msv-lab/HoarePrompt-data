The function `func` accepts two parameters: `S` and `Q`. `S` is a string consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', with a length `N` where \(2 \leq N \leq 10^5\). `Q` is a positive integer representing the number of queries, where \(1 \leq Q \leq 10^5\). For each query, it accepts a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that \(1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N\).

The function processes these queries and returns the results based on the specified conditions for the substrings of `S`. The exact nature of the results is not described in the output, but the function handles multiple queries on the string.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and a positive integer Q representing the number of queries. It processes each query based on the specified indices l_i and r_i, returning results related to the substrings of S.**
