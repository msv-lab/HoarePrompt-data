The variable `S` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which means it will hold the string input from the user. The values of `N` and `Q` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer representing the length of the string, `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries, and `S` is a string input from the user.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the string, `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries, and `S` is a string input from the user**.
