The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `P[2]` will be set to the value of `P[1]`. Since `P[1]` is 2, `P[2]` becomes 2. The other elements of `P` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `P[0]` remains 1, `P[1]` remains 2, and `P[2]` is now 2, with the other elements of `P` remaining 0.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `P[0]` remains 1, `P[1]` remains 2, `P[2]` is 2, and the other elements of `P` remain 0**
