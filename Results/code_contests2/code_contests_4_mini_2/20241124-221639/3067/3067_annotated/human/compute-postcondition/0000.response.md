The values of `N` and `Q` are assigned based on the input, where `map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts those parts into integers. Since `N` represents the length of the string `S` and `Q` is the number of queries, the output state reflects the assignment of these two variables. Other variables remain unaffected at this point.

Output State: **`N` is the length of string `S`, `Q` is the number of queries**
