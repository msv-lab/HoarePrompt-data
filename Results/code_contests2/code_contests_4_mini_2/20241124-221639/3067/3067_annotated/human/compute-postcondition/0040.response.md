The function `func` accepts a parameter `S`, which is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', where `N` is between 2 and 100,000. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `Q`, which is a positive integer representing the number of queries, where `Q` is between 1 and 100,000. For each query, the parameters `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that `1 <= l_i < r_i <= N`. 

The function processes these queries and returns results based on the specified ranges within the string `S`. The specific outputs for each query are not detailed, but they are determined by the values of `l_i` and `r_i` in relation to the string `S`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' and an integer Q representing the number of queries. It handles multiple queries defined by pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) and returns results based on these queries.**
