The statement `P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1` assigns the value of `P[i - 1] + 1` to `P[i]`. Given that `P[0]` is 1 and all other elements are initialized to 0, when `i` is 1, `P[1]` will be assigned the value `P[0] + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`. The other elements of `P` remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `P[0]` is 1, `P[1]` is 2, and all other elements of `P` remain 0.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `P[0]` is 1, `P[1]` is 2, and all other elements of `P` remain 0**
