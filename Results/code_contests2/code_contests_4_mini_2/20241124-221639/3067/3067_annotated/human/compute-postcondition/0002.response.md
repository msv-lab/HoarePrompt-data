The variable `P` is assigned a list that contains `N + 1` elements, all initialized to `0`. The length of the string `S` is represented by `N`, so `P` will have `N + 1` zeros. The values of `N` and `S` are not changed by this operation, and `Q` remains unaffected as well. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is the length of string `S`, `Q` is the number of queries, and `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros.

Output State: **`N` is the length of string `S`, `Q` is the number of queries, and `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros**
