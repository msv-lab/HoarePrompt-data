The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the remaining code in the current loop iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `P[0]` is 0, `P[1]` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `P[0]` is 0, `P[1]` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
