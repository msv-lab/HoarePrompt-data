The statement `P[0] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the first element of the list `P`. The previous value of `P[0]` was `1`, so it is now changed to `0`. The other elements of `P` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `P[0]` is 0, `P[1]` is 2, and all other elements of `P` remain 0.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `P[0]` is 0, `P[1]` is 2, and all other elements of `P` remain 0**
