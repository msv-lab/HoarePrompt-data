The code assigns the values of `l` and `r` by mapping the input from `raw_input()` to integers. The values of `l` and `r` depend on the input provided, but they will be integers. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `l` and `r` are now assigned input integer values.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is greater than 2, `P` is a list with cumulative counts of 'AC' substrings in `S`, `S` has at least 2 characters, `l` and `r` are input integers**
