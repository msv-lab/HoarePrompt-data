The code assigns `P[i]` the value of `P[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, we need to look at the previous value of `P[0]`. Since `P[0]` is 1, we have `P[1] = P[0]`, which means `P[1]` will also be set to 1. The values of `N` and other elements of `P` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `P[0]` is 1, `P[1]` is 1, and all other elements of `P` remain 0.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `P[0]` is 1, `P[1]` is 1, and all other elements of `P` remain 0**
