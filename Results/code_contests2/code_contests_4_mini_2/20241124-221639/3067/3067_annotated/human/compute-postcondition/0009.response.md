The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is currently 0, we need to consider `P[-1]`. In Python, accessing `P[-1]` retrieves the last element of the list `P`, which is `0` (as `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros). Therefore, `P[0]` is assigned the value `0 + 1`, which results in `P[0]` being `1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `P` is a list where `P[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros.**
