Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `P` is a list of `N + 1` integers. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` equals 'AC', then `P[i]` is updated to `P[i - 1] + 1`, which implies that `P[0]` remains 1 and all other elements remain 0. Otherwise, `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1]`, meaning `P[0]` remains 1 and the rest of `P` remains unchanged. Thus, in both cases, `P[0]` is 1, and the rest of the elements in `P` remain 0, unless the condition matches 'AC' which increments `P[0]` accordingly.***
