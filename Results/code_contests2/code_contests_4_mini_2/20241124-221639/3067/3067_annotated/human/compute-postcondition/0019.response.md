Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `P` is a list of `N + 1` integers. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` equals 'AC', then `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1] + 1`, which results in `P[1]` being 2 while `P[0]` remains 1 and all other elements of `P` remain 0. If the substring does not equal 'AC', then `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1]`, resulting in `P[1]` being equal to 1, while `P[0]` remains 1 and all other elements of `P` remain 0.***
