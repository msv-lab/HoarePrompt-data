According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `N` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `N` is greater than 2, it will allow the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`N` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `P` is updated accordingly**
