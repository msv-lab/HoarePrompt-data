The code snippet assigns a new value to `P[i]`, which is calculated as `P[i - 1] + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, we need to find the value of `P[1]` to calculate `P[2]`. 

From the initial state, `P[1]` is 2, so:

```
P[2] = P[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
```

The other elements of `P` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `P[0]` remains 1, `P[1]` remains 2, and `P[2]` is now 3.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `P[0]` remains 1, `P[1]` remains 2, `P[2]` is 3, and other elements of `P` remain 0.**
