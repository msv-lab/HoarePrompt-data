Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 2 and `i` is 2. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is 'AC', then `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1] + 1`, which results in `P[2]` being 3, while `P[0]` remains 1, `P[1]` remains 2, and other elements of `P` remain 0. If the substring is not 'AC', then `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1]`, leading to `P[2]` being 2, while `P[0]` remains 1, `P[1]` remains 2, and the other elements of `P` remain 0.***
