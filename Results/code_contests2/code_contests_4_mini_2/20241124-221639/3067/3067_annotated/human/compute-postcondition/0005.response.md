The statement `P[0] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the first index of the list `P`. Since `P` was initialized as a list of `N + 1` zeros, the value at index `0` is already `0`. Therefore, this assignment does not change the value at that index. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros**
