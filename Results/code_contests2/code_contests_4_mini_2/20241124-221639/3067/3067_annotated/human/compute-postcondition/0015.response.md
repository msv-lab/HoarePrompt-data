The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `i`, and `P[0]` remain unchanged, but the control flow indicates that we will skip the remaining statements within the current loop iteration.

Therefore, the output state remains as is, with no changes to the variable values:

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `P[0]` is 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop**
