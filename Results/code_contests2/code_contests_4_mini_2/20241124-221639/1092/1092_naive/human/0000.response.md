Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly calculate the volume of the text as described. Specifically, it misuses the `max` function by comparing the current word's volume (`s`) with the overall maximum (`m`) after the inner loop completes. This means that it only updates `m` if the current word's volume is greater than zero, which is incorrect in cases where a word may contain a different number of capital letters.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
aA bB cC
```
The expected output should be `1`, since each word has one capital letter, and the maximum volume is `1`. However, the program will incorrectly calculate `m` as `0` since it checks `max(s, m)` after finishing counting each word.

Another case to consider is:
```
10
AAA bcd EFG
```
The expected output is `3` (for "AAA"), but the program would output `0` since it does not properly compute the maximum across all words.

Thus, the program fails to handle cases where words have different volumes properly.
