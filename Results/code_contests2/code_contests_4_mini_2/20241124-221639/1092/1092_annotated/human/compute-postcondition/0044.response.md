Postcondition: ***`s` is either 1, 2, or 3; `m` remains the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`; `i` has at least 3 characters; `j` is the third character of `i`. If `j` is uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1, resulting in `s` being either 2 or 3; if `j` is not uppercase, `s` retains its original value of 1 or 2.***
