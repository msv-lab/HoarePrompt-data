Postcondition: ***`s` is either 0, 1, or 2; `m` is the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`; `i` is a non-empty string; `j` is the second character of `i`. If `j` is an uppercase letter, `s` is incremented by 1, resulting in a new value of `s` that can be 1 or 2. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains unchanged at either 0 or 1.***
