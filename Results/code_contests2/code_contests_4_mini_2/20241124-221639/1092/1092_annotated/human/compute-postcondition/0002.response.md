`m` is assigned the value of `0`. The previous values of the other variables, `n` and `l`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `l` is a list of strings from input, and `m` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `l` is a list of strings from input, and `m` is 0**
