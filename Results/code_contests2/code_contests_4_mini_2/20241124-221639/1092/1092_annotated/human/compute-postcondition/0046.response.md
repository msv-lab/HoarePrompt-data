Output State: **`s` is the count of uppercase letters in the non-empty string `i`, `m` remains the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`, `i` is a non-empty string with at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, and `j` is the current character being evaluated from `i`. If `i` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `s` remains 0 while `m` remains unchanged.**
