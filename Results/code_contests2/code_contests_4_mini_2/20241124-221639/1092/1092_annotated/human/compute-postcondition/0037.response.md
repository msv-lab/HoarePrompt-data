The value of `s` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 0 to 1. The variables `m`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is 1, `m` remains the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`, `i` is a non-empty string, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase letter.

Output State: **`s` is 1, `m` remains the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`, `i` is a non-empty string, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase letter**
