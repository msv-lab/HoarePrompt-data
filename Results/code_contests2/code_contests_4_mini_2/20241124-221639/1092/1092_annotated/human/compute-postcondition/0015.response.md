According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `i`. The loop will execute for each character in `i`, and at the end of the last iteration, `i` has at least 3 characters. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must have at least 4 characters. 

The variable `j` will take on the next character in `i` during the next iteration. If `i` has 3 characters at the end of the previous iteration, `j` will take the last character during that iteration. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must now contain at least 4 characters, and `j` will take the 4th character from `i`.

There's no need to adjust `n`, `l`, `m`, or `s` for the next iteration of the loop since they do not affect the execution of the loop directly in this context. 

Thus, the relevant change is as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `l` is a list of strings containing at least one non-empty string, `i` is a string with at least 4 characters, `m` is 0, and `s` is either 2 or 3**
