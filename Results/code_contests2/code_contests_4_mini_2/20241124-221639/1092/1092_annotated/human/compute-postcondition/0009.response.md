According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more character remaining in the string `i` after the last character processed.

Given that `i` is the first non-empty string in the list `l`, we need to check the current state of `i`. Since `j` is iterated over the characters in `i`, if the loop has completed its last iteration, it means that all characters of `i` have already been processed.

Assuming that the loop has just finished processing the last character of `i`, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `i` must have one more character (i.e., `i` must have at least 2 characters). Additionally, the loop variable `j` will need to be adjusted to reflect the next character in the string, which would be beyond the current length of `i` if it only had one character previously.

Thus, to allow for one more iteration of the loop, `i` should be modified to a string with at least 2 characters.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `l` is a list of strings with at least one non-empty string, `i` is a string with at least 2 characters, `m` is 0, `s` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first character `j` of `i` is uppercase.**
