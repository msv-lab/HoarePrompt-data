The code `raw_input()` accepts a string input from the user, but does not assign it to any variable. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the input. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), and there is a string input that is accepted but not stored.
