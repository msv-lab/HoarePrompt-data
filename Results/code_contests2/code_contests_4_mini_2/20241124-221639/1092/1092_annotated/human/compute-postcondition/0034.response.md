The variable `s` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `s` is not relevant here, but it is being reset to `0`. The values of `m` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is `0`, `m` remains the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`, and `i` is the next non-empty string in `l`.

Output State: **`s` is 0, `m` remains the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`, `i` is the next non-empty string in `l`**
