The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` can be either 0 or 1, after execution, `s` will be either 1 or 2. The values of `m`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is either 1 or 2; `m` is the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`; `i` is a non-empty string; `j` is the second character of `i`.

Output State: **`s` is either 1 or 2; `m` is the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`; `i` is a non-empty string; `j` is the second character of `i**
