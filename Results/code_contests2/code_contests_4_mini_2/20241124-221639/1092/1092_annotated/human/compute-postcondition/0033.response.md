According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `l`. If `l` has more strings, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still a non-empty string, which means that `l` must have more strings to iterate through. Since `m` is the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`, it remains unchanged, and `s` represents the count of uppercase characters in `i`, which will be updated in the next iteration.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `i` is the next string in `l` and that `l` must contain at least one more string than it currently does. 

State: **`s` is the count of uppercase characters in the next string in l, `m` is the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`, `i` is the next non-empty string in l**
