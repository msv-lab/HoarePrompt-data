According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `i`. Each character in the string `i` will be assigned to `j` in each iteration of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a non-empty string, so it has at least one character. 

Since `j` is the first character of `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will need to move to the next character in `i`. After the last iteration, if `j` is an uppercase character, then `s` would have been incremented by 1. If `j` is not uppercase, then `s` remains at its previous value of 0 or 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the values need to be adjusted as follows:
1. `j` needs to be assigned to the next character in `i`, which means if the previous `j` was the first character, it should now reference the second character.
2. Since `j` now refers to the next character in `i`, we also need to adjust `s`. If `j` is the next character and is uppercase, then `s` would become 1 (if it was 0 before) or remain the same (if it was already 1).

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `j` is updated to the next character of the string `i` and `s` is adjusted accordingly.

State: **`s` is 0 or 1, `m` is the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`, `i` is a non-empty string, `j` is the second character of `i` (or the next character in case of multiple iterations)**
