The value of `s` is incremented by 1, and since `s` was initially 0, after execution, `s` becomes 1. The values of `m`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 1, `m` is the maximum of previous `s` and `m`, `i` is a non-empty string, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase character.

Output State: **`s` is 1, `m` is the maximum of previous `s` and `m`, `i` is a non-empty string, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase character**.
