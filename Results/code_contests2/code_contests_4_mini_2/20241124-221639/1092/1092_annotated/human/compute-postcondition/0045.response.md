According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must have at least one more character after the last character processed in the previous iteration. 

Given that `i` has at least 3 characters at the end of the last iteration, and considering that `j` is the third character of `i`, if the loop is set to iterate over `i`, the next character `j` will be the fourth character of `i` in the next iteration. 

Thus, we need to verify and adjust the state of `i` and `j`:

- `s` remains unchanged as it is dependent on the current character being processed.
- We must ensure that `i` has at least 4 characters for the loop to execute one more time, and `j` will be the fourth character in the string.

State: **`s` is either 1, 2, or 3; `m` remains the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`; `i` has at least 4 characters; `j` is the fourth character of `i`.**
