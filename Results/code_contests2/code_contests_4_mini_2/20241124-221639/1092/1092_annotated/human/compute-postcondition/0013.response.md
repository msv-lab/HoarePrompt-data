The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` can be either 1 or 2, after execution, `s` will be 2 or 3, respectively. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `l` is a list of strings containing at least one non-empty string, `i` is a string with at least 3 characters, `m` is 0, and `s` is either 2 or 3.
