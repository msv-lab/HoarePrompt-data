Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a list of space-separated strings from user input. It counts the maximum number of uppercase characters found in any of the input strings and prints this maximum count. If the input list is empty or contains only empty strings, it will print 0, as there are no uppercase characters to count. **
