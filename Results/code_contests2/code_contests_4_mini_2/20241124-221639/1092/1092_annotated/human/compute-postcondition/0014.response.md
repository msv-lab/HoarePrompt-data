Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `l` is a list of strings containing at least one non-empty string, `i` is a string with at least 3 characters, `m` is 0, and `s` is either 2 or 3. If `j` is an uppercase string, then `s` is increased by 1, resulting in `s` being either 3 or 4, depending on its initial value. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains either 2 or 3.***
