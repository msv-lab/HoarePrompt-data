The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` can be either 0, 1, or 2, the new possible values for `s` will be 1, 2, or 3, respectively. The variables `m`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is either 1, 2, or 3; `m` is the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`; `i` is a string with at least 3 characters; `j` is the third character of `i`.

Output State: **`s` is either 1, 2, or 3; `m` is the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`; `i` is a string with at least 3 characters; `j` is the third character of `i`**
