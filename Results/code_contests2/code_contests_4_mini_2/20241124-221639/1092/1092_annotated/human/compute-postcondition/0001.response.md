The variable `l` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which means it will contain a list of strings that were input and split by whitespace. The initial value of `n` does not affect the assignment to `l`, and since the input is not stored, the state of `n` remains unchanged. The output state reflects the unchanged nature of `n` and the new list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `l` is a list of strings from input**
