Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `l` is a list of strings containing at least one non-empty string, `i` is a string with at least 2 characters, `m` is 0, and `s` is either 0 or 1. If the first character `j` of `i` is uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1, resulting in `s` being 1 or 2. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains unchanged.***
