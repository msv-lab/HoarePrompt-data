Postcondition: ***`s` is either 0, 1, or 2. If the third character `j` of string `i` is uppercase, then `s` is incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 1, 2, or 3. The value of `m` remains the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`. In all cases, `i` is a string with at least 3 characters, and `j` is the third character of `i`.***
