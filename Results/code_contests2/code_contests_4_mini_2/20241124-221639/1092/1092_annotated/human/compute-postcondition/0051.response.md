The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive). It also accepts a second parameter, which is a string of words separated by single spaces, consisting only of small and capital Latin letters. After executing the function body, it processes these inputs to generate a specific output based on the conditions defined in the function. However, the details of the output based on the inputs are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` (within the specified range) and a string of words, and it likely returns a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` between 1 and 200 and a string consisting of words separated by spaces, returning a result based on these inputs.**
