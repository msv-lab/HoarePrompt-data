The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `l` is a list of strings with at least one non-empty string, `i` is the first non-empty string in the list `l`, `m` is 0, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase character.
