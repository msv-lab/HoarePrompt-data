The variable `s` is initialized to 0. The other variables remain unchanged: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in the list `l`, and `m` is 0. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `l` is a list of strings, `i` is the first string in the list `l`, `m` is 0, and `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `l` is a list of strings, `i` is the first string in the list `l`, `m` is 0, and `s` is 0**
