According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters in the string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a non-empty string, and `j` is the first character of `i`. 

In the next iteration, `j` will take on the next character in the string `i`. Since `j` is currently the first character, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be updated to the second character of the string `i`. Additionally, the value of `s` will depend on whether this new `j` is an uppercase letter or not.

Since `s` is either 0 or 1, and we know that if `j` is an uppercase letter then `s` is incremented by 1, we need to reflect that `s` could potentially become 1 if the next character is uppercase.

Thus, to execute one more time, we need to adjust `j` to be the second character in the string `i`, and `s` should be able to reflect the state based on whether that character is uppercase.

State: **`s` is 0 or 1, `m` remains the maximum of the previous values of `s` and `m`, `i` is a non-empty string, `j` is the second character of `i`**
