`l` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes a line of input and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Since `n` is a positive integer that represents the length of the text, `l` will contain a list of strings, the number of which can be determined by the input provided. The state of `n` is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), and `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), and `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input**
