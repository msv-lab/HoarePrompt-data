According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which is the first string in the list `l`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `i`. Since `i` is the first string in `l` and `l` has at least one string, `i` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute. Since `m` and `s` are initialized to 0, they do not impact whether the loop runs but may be used within the loop body.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows: `i` must contain at least one character. Additionally, since `j` will iterate over the characters of `i`, `j` should be initialized to the first character of `i` on the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in `l` with at least 1 character, `m` is 0, `s` is 0, `j` is the first character of `i`**
