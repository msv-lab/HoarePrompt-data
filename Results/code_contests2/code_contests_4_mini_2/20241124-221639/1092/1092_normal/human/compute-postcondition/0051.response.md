The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the length of the text (with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 200), and a second parameter which is a string consisting of single-space separated words made up of small and capital Latin letters. The function processes these inputs and yields an output based on the content of the string. 

However, since the specific output behavior of the function is not provided, I will focus on the input parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of the text and a string of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.**
