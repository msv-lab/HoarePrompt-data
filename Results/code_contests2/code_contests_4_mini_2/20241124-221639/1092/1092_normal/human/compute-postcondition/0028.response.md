The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` can be either 1 or 0, after the execution, `s` will be either 2 or 1. The values of `m` and `i` are unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is either 1 or 0; `m` is unchanged; `i` still contains at least one element; `s` is either 2 or 1.

Output State: **`s` is either 1 or 0; `m` is unchanged; `i` still contains at least one element; `s` is either 2 or 1**
