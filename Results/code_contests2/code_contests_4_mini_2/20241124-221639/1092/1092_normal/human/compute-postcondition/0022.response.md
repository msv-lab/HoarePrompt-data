The value of `s` is incremented by 1, and its previous value was 0, so after execution, `s` becomes 1. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is 1, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is an iterable with at least 1 element, and `j` is the first element of `i`, which is an uppercase letter.

Output State: **`s` is 1, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is an iterable with at least 1 element, `j` is the first element of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase letter**
