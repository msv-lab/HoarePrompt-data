Postcondition: ***`s` is either 3, 2, or 1 based on whether `j`, the next element in `i`, is uppercase or not. If `j` is uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1, resulting in `s` being 2 or 3. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains 1 or 0. The value of `m` remains unchanged, and `i` still has at least one element left.***
