The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `s` becomes 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in `l` with at least 1 character, `m` is 0, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase character.**
