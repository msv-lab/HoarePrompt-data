Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in `l` with at least 2 characters, `m` is 0, and `s` is either 1 or 2. If the second character `j` of `i` is uppercase, then `s` is increased by 1, resulting in `s` being either 2 (if it was initially 1) or 3 (if it was initially 2). If `j` is lowercase, `s` remains unchanged.***
