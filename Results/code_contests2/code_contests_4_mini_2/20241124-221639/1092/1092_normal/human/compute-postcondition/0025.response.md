The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` can be either 1 or 0 depending on the new `j`, the possible new values for `s` will be 2 or 1 respectively. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is either 1 or 0; `m` remains unchanged; `i` contains at least one element remaining.

Output State: **`s` is either 1 or 0; `m` remains unchanged; `i` contains at least one element remaining**
