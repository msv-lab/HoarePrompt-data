Postcondition: ***`s` is 1 if the next element of `i` is an uppercase character, otherwise `s` remains 0. The value of `m` remains unchanged, and `i` has at least one element left with `j` being the next element in `i`. If `j` is uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1, resulting in `s` being 2; if `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains unchanged at 1 or 0.***
