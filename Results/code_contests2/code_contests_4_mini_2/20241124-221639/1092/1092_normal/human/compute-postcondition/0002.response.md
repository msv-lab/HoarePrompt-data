The variable `m` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this assignment. The list `l` is also unaffected by the assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `n`, `l`, and the newly assigned value of `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings, `m` is 0**
