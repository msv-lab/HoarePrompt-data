Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list containing at least one string, `i` is the first string in `l` with at least 3 characters, `m` is 0, and `s` is either 1 or 2. If `j`, the second character of `i`, is uppercase, then `s` is incremented by 1, resulting in `s` being either 2 or 3. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains unchanged, thus retaining its initial value of either 1 or 2.***
