The function accepts a list of strings input by the user and counts the maximum number of uppercase letters found in any of those strings. It prints this maximum count. If no uppercase letters are found in any string, it returns 0. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where no input is provided, resulting in an empty list, which would lead to a printed output of 0.
