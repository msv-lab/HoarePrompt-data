Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the example cases provided in the problem description. Specifically, it calculates the maximum number of capital letters in individual words but does not account for the case where a word may contain multiple capital letters. 

For the example input:
```
24
Harbour Space University
```
The program will output `1`, as it counts the capital letters in each word individually but does not aggregate the counts correctly across the words. The correct output should be `3` because "Harbour" has 1 capital letter, "Space" has 1 capital letter, and "University" has 1 capital letter, leading to a maximum volume of 1 for each word.

Additionally, the program relies on `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3 (it should be `input()`). This also indicates that the program is not compatible with the intended execution environment.

Thus, since the program fails to provide the correct output for the given examples, it is deemed incorrect.
