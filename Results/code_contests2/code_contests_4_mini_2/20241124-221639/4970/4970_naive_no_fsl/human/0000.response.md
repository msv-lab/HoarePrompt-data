To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze its behavior based on the problem description and the example provided.

### Problem Description
- The input is a single integer \( a \) where \( 0 \leq a \leq 15 \).
- The output should be a single integer based on the value of \( a \).

### Given Example
- For input \( 3 \), the output is \( 13 \).

### Analyzing the Program
The program uses a list to map input values to output values:
```python
print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

1. The list:
   ```
   [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
   ```
   contains 16 elements, indexed from \( 0 \) to \( 15 \).
   
2. Each index corresponds to an output value based on the input integer \( a \).

### Testing Edge Cases
Since \( a \) can be any integer from \( 0 \) to \( 15 \), we will check the outputs for all values in this range.

- For \( a = 0 \): output is \( 15 \)
- For \( a = 1 \): output is \( 14 \)
- For \( a = 2 \): output is \( 12 \)
- For \( a = 3 \): output is \( 13 \) (as per example)
- For \( a = 4 \): output is \( 8 \)
- For \( a = 5 \): output is \( 9 \)
- For \( a = 6 \): output is \( 10 \)
- For \( a = 7 \): output is \( 11 \)
- For \( a = 8 \): output is \( 0 \)
- For \( a = 9 \): output is \( 1 \)
- For \( a = 10 \): output is \( 2 \)
- For \( a = 11 \): output is \( 3 \)
- For \( a = 12 \): output is \( 4 \)
- For \( a = 13 \): output is \( 5 \)
- For \( a = 14 \): output is \( 6 \)
- For \( a = 15 \): output is \( 7 \)

### Conclusion
The program correctly outputs the corresponding integer for every possible input \( a \) in the range from \( 0 \) to \( 15 \). There are no missing edge cases or incorrect mappings based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
