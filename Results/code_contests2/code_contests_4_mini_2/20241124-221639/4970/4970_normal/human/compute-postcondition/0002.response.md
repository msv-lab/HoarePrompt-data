Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and prints an element from a predefined list based on user input. If the input is not a valid integer index (e.g., if the input is out of the range 0-14), it will raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, the functionality includes the potential for an error if the user inputs an invalid index. **
