The code takes an integer input and uses it to index into a predefined list. The initial state specifies that `a` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a \leq 15 \). The list is fixed as `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. The value at the index specified by `int(raw_input())` will be printed.

Since `a` can be any integer in the range from 0 to 15, the output will be determined by the specific value of `a` chosen as an input.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 15; the output is the corresponding element from the list at index `a`.**
