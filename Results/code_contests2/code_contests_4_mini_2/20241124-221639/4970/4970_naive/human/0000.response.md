To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to check whether the program correctly handles the input and produces the expected output based on the description.

### Problem Description:
- Input: A single integer `a` where `0 ≤ a ≤ 15`.
- Output: A single integer corresponding to the input `a`.

### Program:
```python
print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program takes an integer input using `raw_input()`, which is acceptable for Python 2 but not Python 3 (where it should be `input()`).
2. **Indexing**: The program utilizes a list to map the input value `a` directly to an output based on its index.
3. **Output Values**: The output values are:
   - Index `0` → `15`
   - Index `1` → `14`
   - Index `2` → `12`
   - Index `3` → `13`
   - Index `4` → `8`
   - Index `5` → `9`
   - Index `6` → `10`
   - Index `7` → `11`
   - Index `8` → `0`
   - Index `9` → `1`
   - Index `10` → `2`
   - Index `11` → `3`
   - Index `12` → `4`
   - Index `13` → `5`
   - Index `14` → `6`
   - Index `15` → `7`

4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles inputs in the range from `0` to `15`, as these indices are all present in the list.

### Potential Issues:
- **Input Type**: The program assumes that the input will always be a valid integer within the specified range. If a user inputs a non-integer value or an integer outside the range, it will result in an error (e.g., `ValueError` for non-integer input or `IndexError` for values < 0 or > 15).
- **Python Version**: The use of `raw_input()` suggests that the code is intended for Python 2, which is outdated. If run in Python 3, this will cause a `NameError`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle invalid inputs gracefully, and it is not compatible with Python 3, which would result in errors if executed in that environment. Given these considerations, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases where the input is not an integer or is outside the specified range.
