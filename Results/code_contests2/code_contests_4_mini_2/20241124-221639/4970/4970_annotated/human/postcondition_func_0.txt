The function does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for input, expecting a non-negative integer between 0 and 15 (inclusive). It then retrieves and prints the corresponding value from a predefined list based on the user's input. If the input is outside this range, an IndexError will occur, as the function does not handle invalid inputs.
