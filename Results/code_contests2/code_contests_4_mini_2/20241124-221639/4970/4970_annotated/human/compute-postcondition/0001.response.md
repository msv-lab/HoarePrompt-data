The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it has a constraint that involves a non-negative integer `a` such that \( 0 \leq a \leq 15 \). Since the output is not specified in the provided information, we cannot determine the return value or behavior of the function based on just the constraints and the lack of any output description. Therefore, without further context on how `a` is utilized or what the function returns, we can only note the constraints on `a`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that a non-negative integer `a` exists such that 0 <= a <= 15, but the function's output is not specified.**
