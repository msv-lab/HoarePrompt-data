To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program logic and the accompanying annotations.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func():
    print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

### Problem Description:
- The input is a single integer `a` where `0 ≤ a ≤ 15`.
- The output is a single integer.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The program defines a function `func()` that reads an integer input using `raw_input()`, converts it to an integer, and uses it as an index to access an element from a predefined list.
2. The list is `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which contains 16 elements (indexed from 0 to 15).
3. The program prints the element from the list corresponding to the input index.

### Checking Input and Output:
- For each valid input `a` (from 0 to 15), the program returns the corresponding element in the list.
- The mapping of inputs to outputs based on the given list is:
  - Input `0` → Output `15`
  - Input `1` → Output `14`
  - Input `2` → Output `12`
  - Input `3` → Output `13`
  - Input `4` → Output `8`
  - Input `5` → Output `9`
  - Input `6` → Output `10`
  - Input `7` → Output `11`
  - Input `8` → Output `0`
  - Input `9` → Output `1`
  - Input `10` → Output `2`
  - Input `11` → Output `3`
  - Input `12` → Output `4`
  - Input `13` → Output `5`
  - Input `14` → Output `6`
  - Input `15` → Output `7`

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly handles all inputs from `0` to `15` and outputs the expected results based on the predefined list.
- There are no edge cases or discrepancies noted in the program's logic as defined by the problem description.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True** 

Explanation: The program correctly maps each integer input from `0` to `15` to the corresponding value in the specified list and produces the expected output for all valid inputs.
