To determine the output state, we need to analyze the code snippet provided in relation to the initial state.

1. The initial state indicates that `Arreglo` is `[' b']`, `k` is `4`, and `Cadena` is an input string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and contains small English letters separated by ', '. Given that `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4, we can safely say that there is a character at index `4` in `Cadena`.

2. The line of code `Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]` appends the character located at index `k` of `Cadena` to the list `Arreglo`.

3. Since `Cadena` is a string formatted as described, `Cadena[k]` will yield the character at index `4`. The specific character will depend on the actual input string provided in `Cadena`. However, we can denote it generally as `Cadena[4]`.

4. After executing the line of code, `Arreglo` will contain the original elements plus the new element, `Cadena[4]`.

5. The updated state of `Arreglo` will be `[' b', Cadena[4]]`.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is [' b', Cadena[4]]**
