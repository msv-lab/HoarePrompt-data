Output State: **`if Cadena has more than 2 characters and starts with '{' and ends with '}', then Arreglo will contain every third character from Cadena starting from index 1, and k will be equal to the final index accessed in Cadena after the loop. If Cadena has 2 characters or less, or does not start with '{' and end with '}', then the loop will not execute and Arreglo will remain an empty list, while k will still be 1.`**
