The code assigns to `Arreglo` the value of `Arreglo` concatenated with a list containing the element at index `k` of `Cadena`. The initial state indicates that `Cadena` is a string that starts with '{' and ends with '}', containing small English letters separated by ', '. The variable `k` is 1, which means the second element in the string representation of `Cadena` will be accessed.

Assuming `Cadena` is structured as '{a, b, c}', the element at index `k` (1) corresponds to ' b' (note the space after the comma). Therefore, `Arreglo` will now contain `[' b']`.

The output state is: `Cadena` is an input string starting with '{', ending with '}', and containing small English letters separated by ', '; `Arreglo` is [' b'], and `k` is 1.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string starting with '{', ending with '}', and containing small English letters separated by ', '; `Arreglo` is [' b'], and `k` is 1**
