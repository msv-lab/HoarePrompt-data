The code initializes an empty list `Arreglo`. The initial state of `Cadena` is not affected by this operation, as it remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `Cadena` is still an input string, and `Arreglo` has been initialized as an empty list.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string starting with '{', ending with '}', and containing small English letters separated by ', '; `Arreglo` is an empty list**
