The code concatenates the list `Arreglo` with another list containing the value `Cadena[k]`. Since `len(Cadena)` is greater than `k_initial + 3`, it implies that `k` is a valid index within the bounds of the list `Cadena`. Therefore, the value of `Cadena[k]` will be correctly retrieved and added to `Arreglo`.

The previous value of `Arreglo` is `[' b', Cadena[4]]`, and after executing the code, `Arreglo` will include the new element `Cadena[k]`. 

Thus, the output state is: `Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]` along with the previous values, while `Cadena` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]` along with the previous values, while `Cadena` remains unchanged.**
