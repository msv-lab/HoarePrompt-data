Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and processes an input string from the user. It expects the input to start with '{', end with '}', and contain characters separated by ', '. If the input meets these conditions and has more than two characters, the function extracts every third character starting from index 1 and stores them in a list. It then prints the count of unique characters in that list. If the input does not meet the specified conditions (less than three characters, or not starting and ending with the expected characters), the function will not execute the loop, and the output will be 0, as it will print the length of an empty set. The function does not return any value. **
