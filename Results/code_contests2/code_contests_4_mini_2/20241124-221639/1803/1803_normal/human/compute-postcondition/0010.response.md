The value of `k` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `k` is unknown. The array `Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]`, which means it will now include the value of `Cadena` at the new index `k` after the increment. The state of `Cadena` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]`, and `k` is incremented by 3.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]`, and `k` is incremented by 3**
