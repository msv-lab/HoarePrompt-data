The function reads a string input, `Cadena`, and extracts characters from every third index starting from index 1 if the length of `Cadena` is greater than 3. It then counts and prints the number of unique characters collected in the list `Arreglo`. If the input string has a length of 3 or less, no characters are collected, and the function will print 0. The function does not enforce any specific format for the input string beyond its length.
