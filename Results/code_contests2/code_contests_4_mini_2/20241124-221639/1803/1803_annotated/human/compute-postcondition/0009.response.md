To determine the output state after executing the given code, we analyze the initial state and the impact of the code snippet.

1. The initial state indicates that `Cadena` is a non-empty string that starts with '{', ends with '}', contains lowercase English letters separated by ', ', and has a length greater than 7.
2. The variable `Arreglo` is initialized to `['b', Cadena[4]]`. Since `Cadena` is a string with a length greater than 7, `Cadena[4]` is guaranteed to be a valid character from the string.
3. The variable `k` is set to 7. The code snippet `Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]` appends the character at index 7 of `Cadena` to the list `Arreglo`.

Given that `Cadena` has more than 7 characters, `Cadena[k]` (or `Cadena[7]`) will also be valid. The original `Arreglo` will be extended by one additional element, which is `Cadena[7]`.

So, the output state will reflect the updated `Arreglo` including the new character from `Cadena`.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a non-empty string that starts with '{', ends with '}', contains lowercase English letters separated by ', ', and the length of `Cadena` is greater than 7; `Arreglo` is ['b', Cadena[4], Cadena[7]], `k` is 7**
