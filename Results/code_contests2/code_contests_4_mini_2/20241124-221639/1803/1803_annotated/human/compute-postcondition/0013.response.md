Output State: **If Cadena has a length greater than 3, then Arreglo contains elements from Cadena at every third index starting from index 1, and k is the last value assigned beyond the length of Cadena; thus, len(list(set(Arreglo))) gives the number of unique elements in Arreglo. If Cadena has a length of 3 or less, Arreglo is empty and k remains 1, resulting in len(list(set(Arreglo))) being 0.**
