In the given code, `Arreglo` is updated by appending the character from the string `Cadena` at index `k`. The initial value of `k` is 4, so the character retrieved will be `Cadena[4]`. The existing value of `Arreglo` is `['b']`. 

Since `Cadena` is a non-empty string starting with '{' and ending with '}', and contains lowercase English letters separated by ', ', it can be assumed that the character at index 4 is a valid lowercase letter.

After executing the code, `Arreglo` will now include the character from `Cadena` at index 4. The output state will reflect the updated `Arreglo` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a non-empty string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and contains lowercase English letters separated by ', '; `Arreglo` is ['b', Cadena[4]], `k` is 4**
