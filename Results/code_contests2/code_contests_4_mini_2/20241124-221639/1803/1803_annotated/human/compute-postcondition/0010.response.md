The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since the initial value of `k` is 7, after the operation `k = k + 3`, the new value of `k` becomes 10. The values of `Cadena` and `Arreglo` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `Cadena` is a non-empty string that starts with '{', ends with '}', contains lowercase English letters separated by ', ', and the length of `Cadena` is greater than 7; `Arreglo` is ['b', Cadena[4], Cadena[7]]; `k` is 10.
