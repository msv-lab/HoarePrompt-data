The value of `k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is 1, so after execution, `k` becomes 4. The values of `Cadena` and `Arreglo` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a non-empty string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and contains lowercase English letters separated by ', '; `Arreglo` is ['b'], `k` is 4.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a non-empty string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and contains lowercase English letters separated by ', '; `Arreglo` is ['b'], `k` is 4**
