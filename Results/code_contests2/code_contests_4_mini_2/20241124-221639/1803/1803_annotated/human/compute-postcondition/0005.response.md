According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the variable `Cadena` in relation to `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and greater than 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `Cadena` is a non-empty string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and contains lowercase English letters separated by ', '. 
- `k` is 4.

For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `Cadena` must be greater than both `k` (which is 4) and 2. 

Since `Cadena` is a non-empty string formatted as described, it is guaranteed to have a length greater than 2. However, we need it to also be greater than 4. 

The loop's condition requires:
- `len(Cadena) > 4`

Thus, we need to ensure that `Cadena` has a length greater than 4 at the end of this iteration.

State: **`Cadena` is a non-empty string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and contains lowercase English letters separated by ', ' and len(Cadena) is greater than 4; `Arreglo` is ['b'], `k` is 4**
