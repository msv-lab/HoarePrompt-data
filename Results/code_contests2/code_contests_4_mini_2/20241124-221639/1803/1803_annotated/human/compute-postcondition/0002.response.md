The value of `k` is assigned the value `1`. The variables `Cadena` and `Arreglo` remain unchanged, as the assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `Cadena` is a non-empty string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and contains lowercase English letters separated by ', '; `Arreglo` is an empty list; `k` is 1.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a non-empty string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and contains lowercase English letters separated by ', '; `Arreglo` is an empty list; `k` is 1**
