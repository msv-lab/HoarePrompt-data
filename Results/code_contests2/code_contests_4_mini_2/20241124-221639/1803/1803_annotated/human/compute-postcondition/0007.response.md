The value of `k` is incremented by 3, where `k` initially has a value of 4. After execution, `k` becomes 7. The states of the other variables, `Cadena` and `Arreglo`, are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `Cadena` is a non-empty string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and contains lowercase English letters separated by ', '; `Arreglo` is ['b', Cadena[4]], `k` is 7.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a non-empty string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and contains lowercase English letters separated by ', '; `Arreglo` is ['b', Cadena[4]], `k` is 7**
