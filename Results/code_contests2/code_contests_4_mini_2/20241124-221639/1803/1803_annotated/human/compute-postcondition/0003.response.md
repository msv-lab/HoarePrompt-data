The code assigns to `Arreglo` the current value of `Arreglo` plus a new list containing the element at index `k` of `Cadena`. Given that `Cadena` is a non-empty string formatted as '{a, b, c}', the index `k` is 1, which corresponds to the second element in a zero-indexed list. The string `Cadena` would be split into its elements, yielding 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Therefore, `Cadena[k]` will give the second element of the list, which is 'b'. The initial value of `Arreglo` is an empty list, so after the execution, `Arreglo` will contain the single element ['b'].

Output State: **`Cadena` is a non-empty string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and contains lowercase English letters separated by ', '; `Arreglo` is ['b'], `k` is 1**
