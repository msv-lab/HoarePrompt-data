To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The problem requires us to find a substring within a given string `s` such that reversing that substring makes the entire string lexicographically smaller. The program seems to focus on checking adjacent characters in the string `c` to find a situation where a character is greater than the following character (`c[i] > c[i + 1]`).

### Code Analysis:
1. The program iterates through the string `c` and checks for any adjacent characters where the first is greater than the second.
2. If such a pair is found, it sets a flag and saves the position.
3. If the flag is true after the loop, it outputs "YES" and the positions of the characters that can be reversed.
4. If no such pair is found, it outputs "NO".

### Edge Cases:
- If the input string is already in non-decreasing order (like "aabcfg"), the program correctly outputs "NO", as reversing any substring in that case cannot create a lexicographically smaller string.
- However, the program only checks adjacent characters. This is a potential issue because there could be non-adjacent characters that, if reversed, could yield a smaller string. For example, consider the string "abcda": reversing the substring "bcd" would yield "adcba", which is smaller than "abcda". The algorithm fails to detect such cases since it is only checking pairs of adjacent characters.

### Counterexample:
For the string "abcda", the program would not find any adjacent characters where `c[i] > c[i + 1]` and would incorrectly output "NO", despite the fact that reversing "bcd" yields a valid solution.

### Conclusion:
Since there are cases where the program fails to return the correct outputs as required by the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
