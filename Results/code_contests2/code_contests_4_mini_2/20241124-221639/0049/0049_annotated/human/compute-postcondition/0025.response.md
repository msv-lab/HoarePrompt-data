The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in the typical function signature format, but it operates on two constraints: `n` and `s`. Here, `n` is an integer that must be between 2 and 300,000, and `s` is a string with a length exactly equal to `n`, containing only lowercase Latin letters. 

Since the output details were not provided in the original prompt, we cannot specify any output behavior. However, based on the constraints provided, the functionality can be described in terms of input validation.

The functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:
Functionality: **The function operates on an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) and a string s of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The specific output behavior is not defined.**
