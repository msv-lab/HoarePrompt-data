The variable `c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts input from the user. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged as the input does not affect it. The string `s` is also unaffected since `raw_input()` captures input for `c`. Therefore, the output state is `n` is the first element of the map, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, and `c` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the map, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, and `c` is an input string**.
