Postcondition: ***`n` is 0 or 1, `flag` is False, and `pos` is uninitialized. If `n` is at least 2, `flag` is False and `pos` remains uninitialized, meaning no character `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]` for any index `i`. Additionally, `c` may not be of length `n`, which could potentially cause an error.***
