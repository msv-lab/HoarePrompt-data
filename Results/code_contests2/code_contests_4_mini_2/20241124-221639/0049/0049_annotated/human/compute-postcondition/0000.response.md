The line of code `n = map(int, raw_input().split())` assigns the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to `n`. This means that `n` will now hold a map object that contains integers parsed from the input string provided by `raw_input()`, where the input string is expected to be split into individual elements. 

However, since `n` was previously defined as an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 300000`, and now it is being reassigned to a map object, the integer constraint on `n` is no longer valid. The other variable `s` is unaffected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state reflects the change to `n` and the fact that `s` remains unchanged, while noting that `n` is now a map of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a map of integers from input; `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
