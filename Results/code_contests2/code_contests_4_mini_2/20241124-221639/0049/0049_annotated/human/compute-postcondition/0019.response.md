Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `flag` is True, indicating that there exists at least one index `i` such that `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, and `pos` is the last index where this condition holds. If `n` is 0 or 1, the loop does not execute, `flag` is False, and `pos` remains uninitialized. `c` is a list of characters, and its length is `n`.***
