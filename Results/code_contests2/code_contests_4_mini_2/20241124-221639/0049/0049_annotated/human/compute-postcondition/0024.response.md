Postcondition: ***If `n` is 0 or 1, the function prints 'NO' since `flag` is False and `pos` is uninitialized. If `n` is at least 2 and `flag` is True (indicating that there exists an index `i` such that `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`), the function prints 'YES' and also prints `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`, where `pos` is the last index where this condition holds. If `flag` is False for `n` at least 2, it indicates that no such index exists, and the function prints 'NO' with `pos` being uninitialized. Additionally, if `c` is not of length `n`, it could lead to an error, which is not directly addressed in the output but is a potential concern that should be considered.***
