Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `c` is an input string. If the character at index `i` in string `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to True and `pos` is updated to the value of `i`. If `i` is at the last index of `c`, the comparison is not valid, and no changes are made to `flag` or `pos`, thus retaining their initial values (True for `flag`, 0 for `pos`).***
