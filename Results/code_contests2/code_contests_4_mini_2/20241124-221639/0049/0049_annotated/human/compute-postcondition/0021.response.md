The code prints the values of `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. The variable `pos` represents the last index where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`. Since `n` is at least 2, `pos` must be a valid index within the bounds of the list. The output will show the values of `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`, but since the exact value of `pos` is not given, we cannot specify these numerical results directly.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `flag` is True, `pos` is the last index where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, and the output is 'YES'. The printed output will be `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `flag` is True, `pos` is the last index where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, and the output is 'YES'. The printed output will be `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`.**
