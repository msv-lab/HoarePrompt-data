Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is set to True and `pos` is the index `i` (which is 0) if the character at index `i` in `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`. If the character at index `i` is not greater than the character at index `i + 1`, the values of `flag` and `pos` remain unchanged.***
