Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is set to True, and `pos` is initialized to 0. If the character at index `i` in string `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, then `flag` remains True and `pos` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, `flag` remains True and `pos` remains 0.***
