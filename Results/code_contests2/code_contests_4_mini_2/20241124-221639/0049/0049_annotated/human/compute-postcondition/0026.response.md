Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `c` of length `n`. It checks if there exists an index `i` such that the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`. If such an index exists, it prints 'YES' and the 1-based indices of that pair (i + 1 and i + 2). If no such index exists or if `n` is less than 2, it prints 'NO'. Additionally, if the length of the string `c` does not match `n`, it could lead to an error, which is not handled in the code.**
