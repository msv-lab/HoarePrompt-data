The code executes a print statement which outputs the string 'NO'. The initial state of the variables does not change as print statements do not affect the variables' values. Therefore, the output state is based on the initial values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is 0 or 1, `flag` is False, `pos` is uninitialized, and the function prints 'NO'**
