Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw that prevents it from correctly identifying when it is possible to reverse a substring to create a lexicographically smaller string. 

### Issues Identified:
1. **Initialization of `pos`:** The variable `pos` is only assigned a value when the condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]` is met. If no such condition is met (i.e., if the string is sorted or equal), `pos` remains uninitialized. If `n` is 2 and both characters are the same, the program will fail due to `pos` being uninitialized when it attempts to print it.

2. **Logic for determining reversibility:** The program only checks for adjacent character pairs where the first character is greater than the second (`c[i] > c[i + 1]`). While this might indicate a potential substring reversal, it doesn't account for all possible substrings that could yield a smaller result. For instance, consider the string "abcba". In this case, reversing the substring "bc" would yield "abac", which is lexicographically smaller than "abcba", but this scenario isn't accounted for in the provided logic.

3. **Output format and range:** The program outputs indices as `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`, which assumes that there will always be a valid substring of length 2 to reverse. This assumption fails in cases where the only valid substring to reverse is longer than 2 characters.

### Test Case to Illustrate Failure:
For the input string "aabcfg":
- The program will print `NO` because it does not find any `c[i] > c[i + 1]` in the entire string.
- However, the string is such that reversing any valid substring (like "abc") does not yield a lexicographically smaller string; thus, the logic fails to capture the requirement of checking all possible substrings effectively.

Therefore, due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements for all potential cases.
