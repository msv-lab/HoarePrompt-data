Let's analyze the given Python program against the problem description.

### Problem Description
The task is to find a substring of a given string `s` such that reversing it results in a string that is lexicographically smaller than the original string. If this is not possible, we must output "NO". If it is possible, we should output "YES" and provide the indices of the substring.

### Program Analysis
```python
import math
import collections

n = map(int, raw_input().split())
n = n[0]
c = raw_input()
flag = False
for i in range(n - 1):
    if c[i] > c[i + 1]:
        flag = True
        pos = i
if flag:
    print('YES')
    print(pos + 1, pos + 2)
else:
    print('NO')
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the integer `n` and the string `c`. This part seems correct.
2. **Logic**: It iterates through the string `c` to check if there exists an index `i` such that `c[i] > c[i + 1]`. If found, it sets `flag` to `True` and records the position in `pos`.
3. **Output**: If `flag` is `True`, it outputs "YES" and the positions `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. If not, it outputs "NO".

### Output Hints Analysis
- The output hints indicate that the program checks for an index `i` where `c[i] > c[i + 1]` and prints "YES" with indices if such an index exists.
- The hints also claim that if no such index exists or if `n < 2`, it prints "NO".

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues
1. The program only checks for consecutive characters where the first is greater than the second. However, it does not account for potential larger substrings that could be reversed to create a lexicographically smaller string.
2. For example, in the string "aabc", reversing the substring "ab" gives "acb", which is smaller than "aabc". The current logic would not identify this situation since it only checks adjacent characters.
3. If the string is already sorted (for instance, "abcde"), the program correctly outputs "NO", but it could also miss other valid substrings.

### Conclusion
The code does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, it does not consider reversing longer substrings that could also yield a lexicographically smaller string. 

Correctness: **False**.
