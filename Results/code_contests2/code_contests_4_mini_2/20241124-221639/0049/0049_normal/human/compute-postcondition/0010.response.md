The value of `flag` is changed from `False` to `True`. The values of the other variables `n`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 2, `c` is a string, `flag` is True, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `c` is a string, `flag` is True, `i` is 1**
