Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 1`, and `flag` is set to True if `c[i]` (which is `c[n - 1]`) is greater than `c[i + 1]` (which is `c[n]`); in this case, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. If `c[i]` is less than or equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `flag` remains True, but `pos` is not defined.***
