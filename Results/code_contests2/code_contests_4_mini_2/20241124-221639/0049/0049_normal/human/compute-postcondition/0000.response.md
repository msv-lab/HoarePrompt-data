The variable `n` is reassigned to the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The `raw_input()` function takes user input as a string, which is then split into parts (based on whitespace). Each part is converted to an integer using `int()`. The previous state of `n` as an integer remains unchanged until `raw_input()` is called. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` will now hold the values from the input, converted to integers.

Output State: **`n` is reassigned to the integers obtained from user input**
