The variable `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `c`, `flag`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `pos` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `c` is a string, `flag` is True, `i` is 1, `pos` is 1**
