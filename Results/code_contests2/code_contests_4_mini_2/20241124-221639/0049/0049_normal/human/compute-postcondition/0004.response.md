According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n - 2`, which means `n` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute. The initial value of `i` is `0` at the start of the loop. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` should be greater than or equal to `2`, and `i` should be initialized to `0`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a string, `flag` is False, `i` is 0**
