The code assigns `True` to the variable `flag`. The previous value of `flag` was `False`, and now it is changed to `True`. The other variables `n`, `c`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a string, `flag` is True, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a string, `flag` is True, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c.**
