Postcondition: ***If `flag` is True, it indicates that there exists at least one index `i` such that the character in string `c` at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`. The variable `pos` is defined and holds the last index `i` where this condition was met. If the loop did not execute (i.e., if `n` is less than 2), then `flag` remains False, and `pos` is not defined.***
