Postcondition: ***If `flag` is True, then the output is 'YES', and `pos` is defined, holding the last index `i` where a character in string `c` at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, resulting in the print output of (pos + 1, pos + 2). If `n` is less than 2, `flag` is False, and `pos` is not defined, leading to the output 'NO'. If `n` is 2 or greater and the loop executed but no such condition was met, `flag` remains False and `pos` remains undefined, also resulting in the output 'NO'.***
