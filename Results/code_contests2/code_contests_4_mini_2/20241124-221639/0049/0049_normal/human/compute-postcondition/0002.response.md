The value of `c` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which accepts user input as a string. However, the value of `n` is unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer (the first element of the user input list), `c` is a string (the user input).

Output State: **`n` is an integer (the first element of the user input list), `c` is a string (the user input)**
