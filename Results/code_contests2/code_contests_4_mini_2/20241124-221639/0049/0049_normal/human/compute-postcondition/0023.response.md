The `print` function outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of `n`, `flag`, and `pos` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is less than 2, `flag` is False, and `pos` is not defined.

Output State: **`n` is less than 2, `flag` is False, and `pos` is not defined**
