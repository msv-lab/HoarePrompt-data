The value of `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. Given that `i` is `n - 1` and `n` is greater than 2, `i` will have a defined value (specifically, it will be at least 2). The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `flag` is True, and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `flag` is True, `pos` is `n - 1`**
