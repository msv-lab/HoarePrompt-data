Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a string `c` of length `n`. It checks if there exists an index `i` such that the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` in the string. If such an index is found, it prints 'YES' along with the 1-based indices of `i + 1` and `i + 2`. If no such index exists or if `n` is less than 2, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. **
