Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a string, and `flag` is False initially. If the character at index `i` (which is 0) of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c`, then `flag` is set to True, and `pos` is updated to 0. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains False, and `pos` is not defined in this code block.***
