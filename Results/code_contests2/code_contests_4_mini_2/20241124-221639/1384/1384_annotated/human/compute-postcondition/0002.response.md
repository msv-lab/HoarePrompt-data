The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the constraints provided, it operates with two integers, `T` and `X`, that fall within the range of 1 to 100. Since the output is not specified in the details provided, we cannot determine the return behavior. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to operate with the integers `T` and `X` but does not explicitly define an output based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with integers T and X within the range of 1 to 100, but the return behavior is not defined.**
