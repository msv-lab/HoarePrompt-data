Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A by using the formula `t / x`, where `t` is the number of hours Taro studies in World B and `x` is the speed factor of time passage between the two worlds. However, the problem description requires the calculation to reflect the time that passes in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B.

The correct formula should be:

\[
\text{hours in World A} = \frac{T}{X}
\]

In the given code, `t` is read as a float, which is fine, but it is misleading because it should represent the total hours Taro plans to study, not a variable name. Additionally, the input values should both be integers, and the program should handle this correctly.

For example, if we input:

```
8 3
```

The expected output is:

```
2.6666666667
```

This output is correct. However, if we input:

```
99 1
```

The expected output is:

```
99.0000000000
```

The program would still provide the correct output as `99 / 1`, which is valid. 

However, if we consider an input like:

```
1 100
```

The expected output should be:

```
0.0100000000
```

In this case, the program outputs `1 / 100`, which is still correct.

Despite the calculations being correct in these cases, the use of `map(float, input().split())` implies the program does not strictly adhere to the input type constraints mentioned in the problem description, where both T and X should be integers. Thus, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements completely.

Therefore, since the program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases (specifically regarding input types), the correctness is deemed **False**.
