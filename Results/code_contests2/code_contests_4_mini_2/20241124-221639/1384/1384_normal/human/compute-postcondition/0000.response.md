The variables `t` and `x` are assigned values based on the input. The `input()` function will take user input as a string, which is then split into two parts and converted to float using `map(float, ...)`. Since `T` and `X` are positive integers, the values assigned to `t` and `x` will be floating-point representations of those integers. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`T` and `X` are positive integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100; `t` and `x` are float values representing the input integers.**
