Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, reads two floating-point numbers from input, and prints the result of dividing the first number by the second. It does not handle cases where the second number is zero, which would lead to a division by zero error. Additionally, the function does not enforce constraints on the input values, meaning that the input can be any floating-point numbers, not limited to the positive integers between 1 and 100 as described in the annotations. **
