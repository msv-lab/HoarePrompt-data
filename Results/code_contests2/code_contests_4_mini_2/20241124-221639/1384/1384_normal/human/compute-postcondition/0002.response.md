The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with positive integers T and X, with constraints that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100. The function returns an unspecified output based on the logic defined within it, which is not provided in the prompt. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate within the constraints of positive integers T and X, but since it does not accept parameters, it likely uses predefined or global values for T and X. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with positive integers T and X that are constrained between 1 and 100.**
