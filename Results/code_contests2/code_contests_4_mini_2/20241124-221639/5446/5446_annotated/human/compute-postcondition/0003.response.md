The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` is an integer constrained such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), where `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake respectively, with the constraints \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\). 

The output of the function is determined by the conditions of the input parameters. If `n` meets the specified constraints and relationships, the function will return a result based on those values. However, the specific return value based on the cases is not provided in the prompt.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) and two integers `a` and `b` (where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100), and returns a result based on these parameters.**
