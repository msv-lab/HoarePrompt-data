Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs `n`, `b`, and `c` through user input. It calculates the ratio of the maximum of `b` and `c` to the minimum of `b` and `c`, then computes a value based on this ratio and the input `n`. Finally, it prints the ceiling of the product of the minimum of `b` and `c` divided by `n` and the calculated ratio. However, there is no return statement, so it does not return any value. Additionally, the input constraints mentioned in the annotations are not enforced within the code, making it susceptible to invalid inputs.**
