To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet provided.

Initial State: `x` is max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))

1. The variable `x` is already defined as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`.
2. The `print` statement attempts to print the result of `int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x))`.
3. Here, `min(b, c)` is calculated, and then it is divided by `float(n)`. This result is then multiplied by `x`.
4. The `ceil` function is applied to this product, and then the result is converted to an integer using `int()` before printing.

At this stage, no values have been provided for `b`, `c`, or `n`, and thus the output state will describe the situation based on the operations without specific numerical results.

Output State: **`x` is max(b, c) / float(min(b, c)); the print statement prints int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x))**
