Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. The program uses `n, b, c` instead of `n, a, b`. This is an incorrect mapping of the input values. The first value in the input should correspond to `n` (number of plates), the second to `a` (pieces of the first cake), and the third to `b` (pieces of the second cake).

2. The calculation for `x` is incorrect. The formula `x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` does not logically represent the maximum possible number of pieces that can be distributed such that each plate has at least `x` pieces. Instead, the maximum possible number `x` should be calculated based on how the pieces of the two cakes can be distributed across `n` plates while fulfilling the conditions laid out in the problem description.

3. The logic doesn't check for the valid distribution of cake pieces across the plates. Specifically, the program does not ensure that each plate gets at least one piece, nor does it handle the distribution of cake pieces effectively. 

To illustrate a failure case, consider the input `5 2 3`. The expected output is `1`, as there are enough pieces to ensure that each of the 5 plates gets at least 1 piece. However, the program would likely produce an incorrect output due to the flawed logic and variable misuse.

In conclusion, the program does not satisfy the requirements outlined in the problem statement for all potential inputs, leading to the determination of incorrectness.
