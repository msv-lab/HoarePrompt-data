Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. 

Let's analyze the code and the requirements:

1. The code takes three inputs: `n`, `b`, and `c`, which corresponds to `n` (number of plates), `a` (pieces of the first cake), and `b` (pieces of the second cake). However, it uses `b` and `c` for calculations, which seems to confuse the pieces of the cakes.

2. The expression `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` does not correspond to the requirements of maximizing the minimum number of pieces on any plate. The goal is to distribute pieces such that the minimum number of pieces on any plate is maximized.

3. The program uses `ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)`, which doesn't accurately reflect the logic needed to ensure that all plates receive at least one piece of cake without mixing them.

For example, consider the input:
```
n = 5, a = 2, b = 3
```
According to the problem, the output should be `1` since each plate can get at least one piece. This case is handled correctly in the provided logic. However, it does not handle other situations correctly.

Now consider an edge case:
```
n = 3, a = 5, b = 5
```
In this case, the ideal distribution would be:
- 3 plates with 2 pieces each from one cake and the remaining pieces can be handled as needed.
The output should be `2`, but the current logic in the code would not yield this result.

Thus, since the program fails to handle certain inputs correctly, it cannot be considered correct for all potential cases.
