Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100; `b` is assigned a value from input; `c` is assigned a value from input; `x` is max(`b`, `c`) / float(min(`b`, `c`)); and the result of the calculation int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)) is printed.**
