The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b` are implied to be defined or passed in some other way. However, the function operates under the constraint that `n` is an integer such that \(2 ≤ n ≤ a + b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers constrained by \(1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100\). 

The function's output is not specified in the prompt. Without additional information on what the function returns based on the conditions provided, we cannot determine the exact functionality.

Therefore, based on the given constraints, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly, but operates under the constraints that n is an integer between 2 and a + b, with a and b being integers between 1 and 100. The specific return value of the function is not defined in the provided information.**
