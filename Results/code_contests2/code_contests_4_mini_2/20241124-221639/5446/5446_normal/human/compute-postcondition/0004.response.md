Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters but reads three integers from input: `n`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`, then computes the ceiling value of the product of the minimum of `b` and `c` divided by `n` and the previously calculated quotient. The result is printed as an integer. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or negative, which could lead to division by zero errors in the calculation. **
