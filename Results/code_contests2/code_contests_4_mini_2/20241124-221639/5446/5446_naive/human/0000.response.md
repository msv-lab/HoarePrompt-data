To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code.

**Problem Description Recap:**
1. Each piece of each cake must be put on some plate.
2. Each plate must contain at least one piece of cake.
3. No plate can contain pieces from both cakes.
4. We need to maximize the minimum number of pieces on any plate.

**Input:**
- Three integers: `n` (number of plates), `a` (pieces of the first cake), and `b` (pieces of the second cake).

**Output:**
- The maximum possible number `x` such that each plate contains at least `x` pieces of cake.

**Provided Program:**
```python
(n, b, c) = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))
print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))
```

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. It reads three integers but mistakenly assigns `b` and `c` from the input in a way that does not match the meaning of `a` and `b`.
2. `x` is calculated based on the maximum and minimum pieces of cakes, but the logic does not align with the need to maximize the minimum number of pieces per plate.
3. The final output computation also does not reflect the problem's requirements, specifically how to distribute the pieces to ensure every plate gets at least one piece without mixing cakes.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not correctly account for the distribution of pieces to ensure each plate has at least one piece.
- The calculation for `x` is flawed because it does not consider the fact that the total number of plates (`n`) must be filled with pieces from only one cake each.
- The formula used to determine `x` does not guarantee that the minimum pieces per plate are maximized under the given constraints.

### Test Cases:
1. For input `5 2 3`, the correct output is `1`, but the calculation based on the code logic does not ensure that all combinations are valid for distributing pieces effectively.
2. For input `4 7 10`, while the correct output is `3`, the logic in the code does not properly assess how the pieces from each cake can be allocated correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to meet the problem's requirements due to incorrect logic and calculations. It does not handle the distribution of cake pieces according to the given constraints.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum minimum number of pieces `x` that can be placed on each plate under the conditions provided in the problem description.
