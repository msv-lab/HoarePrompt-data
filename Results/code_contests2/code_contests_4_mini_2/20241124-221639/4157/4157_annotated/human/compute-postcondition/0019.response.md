The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses.
- `a`: a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses.
- `d`: a positive integer representing the distance to the final station.
- For each trolleybus, `ti`: a non-negative integer indicating the time it leaves the depot.
- For each trolleybus, `vi`: a positive integer representing its maximum speed.

The function processes these parameters to determine the behavior of the trolleybuses based on their departure times, maximum speeds, and the given constraints related to distance and acceleration. However, the specific output or return values based on these parameters are not defined in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, d, a list of departure times ti, and a list of maximum speeds vi for each trolleybus, and processes this information based on the constraints provided.**
