The line of code `n, a, d = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `d`. The initial values of these variables are not defined because they will be determined by user input. Therefore, `n`, `a`, and `d` will hold the values provided by the user, while `ti`, `vi`, and `t` remain unchanged. 

The output state indicates that `n`, `a`, and `d` will now have values based on the input, while `ti`, `vi`, and `t` retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `a` is an input positive integer, `d` is an input positive integer, `ti` is a non-negative integer, `vi` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0**
