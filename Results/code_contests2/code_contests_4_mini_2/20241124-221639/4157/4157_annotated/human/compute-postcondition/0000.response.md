The variable `t` is assigned the value `0.0`. This action does not affect any of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `d`, `ti`, or `vi`) as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `t` while noting that the other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses, `a` is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses, `d` is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station, for each trolleybus, `ti` is a non-negative integer indicating the time it leaves the depot, `vi` is a positive integer representing its maximum speed, and `t` is 0.0**
