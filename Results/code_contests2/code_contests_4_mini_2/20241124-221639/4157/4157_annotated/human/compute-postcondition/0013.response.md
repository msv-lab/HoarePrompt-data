The code assigns values to `ti` and `v` using the `map` function to convert input values from `raw_input()` into floats. The variable `ti` is updated to a float value from input, while `v` is also updated to a float value from input. The previous values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `d`, and `t` are unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values of `ti` and `v` based on the input received, while the other variables remain in their original state.

Since the values of `ti` and `v` are derived from user input, we cannot specify exact values without knowing the input. Thus, we note them as updated float values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is an input positive integer, `d` is an input positive integer, `ti` is updated to a float value from input, `v` is updated to a float value from input, and the function prints `t`.**
