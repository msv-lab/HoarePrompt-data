To analyze the given code snippet, we need to examine the impact of the code on the state of the variables provided in the initial state.

1. The expression for `t1` calculates a value based on the given inputs `a`, `d`, and `v`.
2. The calculation is conditional:
   - If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` will be calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.
   - Otherwise, `t1` will be calculated as `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

3. The variable `t` is printed, which implies that `t` is assigned the value of `t1` before it is printed.

Since the values of `a`, `d`, and `v` are determined by user inputs, we will represent them generically as input positive integers or floats. The values of `n` and `i` do not change as a result of this operation.

Thus, we can summarize the output state:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is an input positive integer, `d` is an input positive integer, `ti` is updated to a float value from input, `v` is updated to a float value from input, and the function prints `t`.**
