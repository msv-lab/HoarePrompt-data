Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs: `n` (the number of iterations), `a` (acceleration), and `d` (distance). It reads `n` pairs of floating-point values representing departure times (`ti`) and maximum speeds (`vi`) for each iteration. It calculates and updates a maximum time `t` based on the provided formulas for each iteration. If `n` is 0 or negative, the function does not process any input values for `ti` and `vi`, and the time `t` remains 0.0. After processing all iterations, the function prints the maximum time `t` for each iteration.**
