To determine the output state after executing the given code, we need to analyze the provided variables and the expression. We know that `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `d`, `ti`, and `vi` are positive integers with `ti` and `vi` assigned from the input, and `t` is initialized to 0.0. 

The code snippet is:

```python
t1 = v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v if d > v * v / (2 * a) else math.sqrt(2 * d / a)
```

From the conditions, we can infer the following:

1. `v` is assigned from the input and is a positive integer.
2. The expression checks whether `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`.
3. Depending on the result of this condition, `t1` is calculated either using the first part of the expression or using the `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

Since we do not have specific values for `a`, `d`, and `v`, we can only express the possible output state in terms of these variables.

Thus, the output state reflects these calculations and the variables' states, while also indicating that `t1` is assigned a value based on the calculation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input positive integer, `d` is an input positive integer, `ti` is an input non-negative integer, `vi` is an input positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `t1` is assigned either `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v` if `d > v * v / (2 * a)` or `math.sqrt(2 * d / a` otherwise.**
