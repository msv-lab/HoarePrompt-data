The value of `t1` is computed based on the conditional expression. Depending on the values of `d`, `v`, and `a`, we will determine which part of the expression is executed.

1. The condition checks if `d > v * v / (2 * a)`. 
2. If the condition is true, `t1` is assigned the value of `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.
3. If the condition is false, `t1` is assigned the value of `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

Since `n`, `i`, `ti`, and `vi` do not affect the calculation of `t1`, their values remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the values of the variables involved and the calculation of `t1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an input positive integer, `d` is an input positive integer, `ti` is updated to a float value from input, `vi` is an input positive integer, `v` is updated to a float value from input, and `t1` is calculated based on the condition**.
