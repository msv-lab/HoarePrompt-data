To determine the correctness of the provided program, let’s analyze the code and the problem description step by step.

The problem describes a scenario where multiple trolleybuses leave a depot at various times, with a maximum speed and acceleration. The task is to calculate the time each trolleybus arrives at the final station, taking into account the possibility of them catching up with each other.

### Analyzing the Code

The function `func()` reads input values and calculates the arrival time for each trolleybus. Here’s how the code works:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - It first reads the number of trolleybuses `n`, the maximum acceleration `a`, and the distance `d`.
   - Then, it enters a loop to read the departure time `ti` and maximum speed `vi` for each trolleybus.

2. **Time Calculation**:
   - The time `t1` for each trolleybus to reach the final station is calculated using two different formulas:
     - If the trolleybus can reach its maximum speed before hitting the distance `d`, it calculates the time based on acceleration and distance.
     - If it cannot reach maximum speed before the distance is covered, it uses the formula for uniform acceleration.
   - The maximum of the calculated time `t1 + ti` and the previously stored maximum time `t` is updated.

3. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the maximum arrival time for each trolleybus.

### Potential Issues

The annotated explanation suggests that `t` is updated to the maximum value at each iteration, but it does not account for the scenario where trolleybuses catch up with each other. When a trolleybus catches up to another, they travel together at the speed of the leading trolleybus. Therefore, just calculating the maximum time independently for each trolleybus does not yield the correct result when one trolleybus catches up to another.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue

Consider the following test case:

```
2 10 100
0 10
5 5
```

- The first trolleybus leaves at `t1 = 0` with a maximum speed of `10`. It will accelerate and reach the station.
- The second trolleybus leaves at `t2 = 5` with a maximum speed of `5`, which will not reach the first trolleybus.
- However, if we calculate the arrival times separately:
  - Trolleybus 1 arrives at `t = 10` seconds.
  - Trolleybus 2 arrives at `t = 10` seconds as well, but the program does not check if it needs to wait for the first trolleybus.

In this case, both trolleybuses should arrive at the same time, but the code could potentially handle them incorrectly if they were not meant to catch up.

### Conclusion

The program fails to account for the interaction between trolleybuses as they may catch up with each other and need to travel together at the speed of the leading trolleybus. This oversight makes the program incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
