Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters directly; instead, it reads input values for `n`, `a`, and `d` from user input. It calculates the maximum arrival time of trolleybuses based on their departure times and speeds. For each of the `n` trolleybuses, it computes a value `t1` based on the given formulas that depend on `d` and `v`, and then updates a maximum time `t`. After processing all trolleybuses, it prints the maximum time `t` after each calculation. If `n` is 0 or negative, the function does nothing and `t` remains 0.0. Therefore, it returns no value, only printing the results for each trolleybus, which may not match the intended behavior described in the annotations. **
