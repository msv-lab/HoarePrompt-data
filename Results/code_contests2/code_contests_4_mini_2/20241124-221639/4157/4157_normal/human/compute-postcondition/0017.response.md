According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the positive integer `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, making it 3. Since `n` is a positive integer, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `n` must be greater than 3, and `i` should be updated to 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is max(t1 + ti, t), `i` is 3, `ti` is a float input, `v` is a float input**
