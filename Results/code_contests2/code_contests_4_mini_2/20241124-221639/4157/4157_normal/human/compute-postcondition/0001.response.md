The code snippet takes input values for `n`, `a`, and `d`, which are all positive integers. The values are parsed from the input string and assigned to the respective variables. The variable `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the new values of `n`, `a`, and `d`, while `t` retains its initial value of 0.0. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0**
