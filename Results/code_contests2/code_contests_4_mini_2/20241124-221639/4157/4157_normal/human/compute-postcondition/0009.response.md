The value of `t1` is assigned based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`. If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` is calculated using the formula `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`. Otherwise, `t1` is assigned the value of `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`. The variables `n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, `i`, and `ti` are not affected by this assignment, and their values remain the same. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is the maximum of `t1 + ti` and 0.0, `i` is 1, `ti` is a float input, `v` is a float input, and `t1` is calculated based on the condition.
