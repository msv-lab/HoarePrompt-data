The code prints the value of `t`, which is previously updated to `max(t1 + ti, t)`. Since `t` is printed, its value will be reflected in the output state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is `max(t1 + ti, t)`, `i` is 2, `ti` is a float input, `v` is a float input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is `max(t1 + ti, t)`, `i` is 2, `ti` is a float input, `v` is a float input**
