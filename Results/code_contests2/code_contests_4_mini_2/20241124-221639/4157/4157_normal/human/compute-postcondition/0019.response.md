The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `n`, `a`, `d`, and a list of tuples representing trolleys, where each tuple contains `ti` and `vi`. 

- `n` is a positive integer that indicates the number of trolleybuses.
- `a` is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration.
- `d` is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station.
- Each trolleybus is represented by a tuple containing:
  - `ti`, a non-negative integer indicating the time of departure, which is strictly increasing.
  - `vi`, a positive integer indicating the maximum speed of the trolleybus.

After executing the function body, the function determines the earliest possible arrival time at the final station for each trolleybus based on its departure time and speed, considering the maximum acceleration. The function will return a list of arrival times for each trolleybus.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `a`, `d`, and a list of tuples representing the departure times and speeds of trolleybuses, and returns a list of arrival times at the final station for each trolleybus.**
