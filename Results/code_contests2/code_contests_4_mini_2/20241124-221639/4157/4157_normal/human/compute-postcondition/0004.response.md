The variable `t1` is assigned a value based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`. The calculation for `t1` will depend on whether `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)` or not.

1. If `d > v * v / (2 * a)` is true, then:
   - `t1` is calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.
   
2. If `d <= v * v / (2 * a)` is false, then:
   - `t1` is calculated as `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

Since `n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, and `i` are positive integers, and `t` is initialized to 0.0 with `i` to 0, the final value of `t1` will depend on the specific values of `a`, `d`, and `v`.

The output state will reflect the new value of `t1` based on the calculations, but as the exact values of `a`, `d`, and `v` are unspecified, we can't explicitly calculate `t1`. Therefore, the state will indicate that `t1` has been computed based on the given conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0, `ti` and `v` are assigned values from input converted to float, and `t1` is calculated based on the condition involving `d` and `v`.**
