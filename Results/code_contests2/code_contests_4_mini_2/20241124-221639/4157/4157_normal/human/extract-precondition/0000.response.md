Precondition: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), d is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6), and for each trolleybus, ti is a non-negative integer indicating the time of departure (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) and vi is a positive integer indicating the maximum speed (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6). The departure times are strictly increasing (0 ≤ t1 < t2 < ... < tn ≤ 10^6).**
