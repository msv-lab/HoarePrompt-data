Correctness: **False**

The program contains a flaw in its logic that does not account for when trolleybuses catch up to each other. Specifically, it calculates the time `t1` for each trolleybus to reach the final station based solely on its own parameters (departure time, maximum speed, and acceleration), without considering the scenario where one trolleybus might catch up to another. 

For example, consider the following input scenario:

```
2 10 100
0 10
5 5
```

- The first trolleybus leaves at time `0` with a maximum speed of `10` m/s.
- The second trolleybus leaves at time `5` with a maximum speed of `5` m/s.

According to the physics of the situation, the first trolleybus will reach the final station significantly earlier than the second one due to its greater speed, and the second trolleybus will catch up with the first one after it leaves the depot.

The first trolleybus would take approximately `10` seconds to reach the station, while the second trolleybus would take longer because it needs to accelerate from rest. The program fails to account for the fact that the second trolleybus would need to follow the first once it catches up, leading to a potentially incorrect output for the second trolleybus. 

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to handle the case of trolleybuses catching up to one another, which leads to a situation where the output will not be accurate for all scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
