Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly identifying Pythagorean triples for all input cases:

1. The usage of `raw_input()` is incorrect in Python 3; it should be `input()`. This will cause a runtime error if the code is executed in a Python 3 environment.
   
2. The expression `(print(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)` will lead to a `TypeError` because the `print` function returns `None`, and tuples cannot contain `None` values. The correct form should compute the values and then print them separately.

3. The logic for calculating the Pythagorean triples is correct for odd and even values of `n`, but it does not handle the case where `n` is 1 correctly, as it doesn't check if it can form a valid Pythagorean triple (which it cannot). The output should be `-1`, but the program may not handle this gracefully due to the earlier issues.

For example, if we input `1`, the program should directly return `-1`, but because of the incorrect checks and the use of `print` in a tuple, it might not behave as expected.

Thus, there is at least one case (input value `1`) where the program does not behave correctly according to the problem description.
