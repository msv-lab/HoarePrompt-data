The state of `n` is updated to the value obtained from `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), the output state will reflect that `n` has been assigned an input integer value within this range. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
