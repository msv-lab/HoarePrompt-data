The expression `print(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2` involves two calculations based on the value of `n`. 

1. The first part calculates `(n * n - 1) / 2`.
2. The second part calculates `(n * n + 1) / 2`.

Since `n` is an odd integer within the range of 3 to \(10^9\), we can denote `n` as an odd integer, which can take various values within that range.

The calculations yield:
- For an odd integer `n`, \( n * n \) is also odd. Therefore, \( n * n - 1 \) is even, making `(n * n - 1) / 2` an integer.
- Conversely, \( n * n + 1 \) is even, so `(n * n + 1) / 2` is also an integer.

However, without a specific value for `n`, we cannot determine exact numerical outputs, but we can express the results in terms of `n`. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the two calculated expressions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `n` is an odd integer; the results are ((n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)**
