The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. Since there is no specific output provided in the task, we cannot determine the exact return value. Thus, the functionality of the function func is to accept a positive integer `n` within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
