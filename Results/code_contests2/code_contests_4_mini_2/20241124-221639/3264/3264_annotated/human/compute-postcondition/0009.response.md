Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the output is -1. If `n` is an odd integer in the range 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, the output is calculated as ((n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2). If `n` is an even integer in the range 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, the output is (n * n / 4 - 1, n * n / 4 + 1). All calculations ensure that the results remain valid within the constraints of `n`.***
