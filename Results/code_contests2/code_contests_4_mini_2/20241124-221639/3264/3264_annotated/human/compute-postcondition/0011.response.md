Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns -1 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is odd and greater than 2, it computes and outputs the values ((n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2). If `n` is even and greater than 2, it computes and outputs (n * n / 4 - 1, n * n / 4 + 1). The function does not return any values but prints the results directly. **
