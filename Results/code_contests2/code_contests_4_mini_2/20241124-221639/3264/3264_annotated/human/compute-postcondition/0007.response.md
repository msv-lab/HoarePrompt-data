The code calculates two values based on `n`. 

1. The first expression calculates `n * n / 4 - 1`.
2. The second expression calculates `n * n / 4 + 1`.

Given that `n` is an even positive integer, we can express `n` as `2k` for some integer `k`. Therefore:

- The first expression simplifies to `(2k * 2k) / 4 - 1 = k^2 - 1`.
- The second expression simplifies to `(2k * 2k) / 4 + 1 = k^2 + 1`.

Since `n` is a positive integer such that `3 ≤ n ≤ 10^9` and `n` is an even number, the calculations will yield specific results based on the actual value of `n`. However, we do not need to specify a particular value for `n` because the output can be expressed in terms of `k`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the calculated results for both expressions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `n` is an even number; the two calculated values are `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`.**
