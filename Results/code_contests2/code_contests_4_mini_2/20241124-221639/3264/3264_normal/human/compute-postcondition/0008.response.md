Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2. If `n` is odd, the program prints the values of `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`, both of which are integers. If `n` is even, the program prints the values of `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`, which also yield integer results since `n` is divisible by 2.***
