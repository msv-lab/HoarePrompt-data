The code attempts to execute `print - 1`, which is a syntactically incorrect statement in Python. Therefore, the output state indicates that an error occurs. The value of `n` does not change, and its state remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, and `n` is less than or equal to 2, and a syntax error occurs due to the invalid print statement.**
