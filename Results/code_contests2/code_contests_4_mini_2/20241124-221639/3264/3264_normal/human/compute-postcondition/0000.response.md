Given the initial state where `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), the code snippet provided assigns the value of `n` using `int(raw_input())`, which means `n` will take the integer value from input. 

Since the condition states that if \( n \) is less than or equal to 2, the output is -1, the output state will depend on the input value for `n`. 

However, since we are not given a specific input or value for `n`, we cannot determine the exact output state with regard to `m` and `k`. 

The output state will reflect that `n` is now an integer from input and if \( n \leq 2 \), the output is -1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and if `n` â‰¤ 2, the output is -1**
