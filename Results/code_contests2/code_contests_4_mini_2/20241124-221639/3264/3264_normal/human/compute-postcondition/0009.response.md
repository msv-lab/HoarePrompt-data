Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the program attempts to print -1, resulting in a syntax error due to the invalid print statement. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, the program prints the integer values of `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is even, it prints the integer values of `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. The program handles all cases for `n`, including the edge cases of `n` equal to 2 and odd/even values greater than 2.***
