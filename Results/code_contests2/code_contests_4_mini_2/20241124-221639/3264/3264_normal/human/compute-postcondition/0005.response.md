The code contains two expressions that are calculated and printed. The first expression is `(n * n - 1) / 2` and the second is `(n * n + 1) / 2`. 

Given that `n` is an odd integer greater than 2, we can express `n` in the form of `2k + 1` for some integer `k`. 

Calculating the first expression:
1. `n * n` results in an odd number since the square of an odd number is odd.
2. `n * n - 1` is even (an odd number minus 1).
3. Dividing an even number by 2 results in an integer.

Calculating the second expression:
1. `n * n + 1` is also even (an odd number plus 1).
2. Dividing this even number by 2 also results in an integer.

Both expressions yield integer results. 

Thus, the output state will reflect that `n` is an odd integer greater than 2, and both calculated results will be integers based on the above expressions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2 and odd; both expressions yield integer results: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2**
