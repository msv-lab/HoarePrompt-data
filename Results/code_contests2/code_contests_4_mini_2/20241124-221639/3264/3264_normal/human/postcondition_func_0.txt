The function accepts an integer `n` from user input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it attempts to print -1 but has a syntax error due to the invalid print statement. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, it prints the integer values of `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is even, it prints the integer values of `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. The function has a missing handling for erroneous input and will not return any values; instead, it prints results directly.
