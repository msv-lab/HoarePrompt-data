Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when `n` is an even integer that is not a multiple of 4. For example, if we input `n = 6`, the program calculates the values of `m` and `k` using the formula for even `n`. However, the output is derived from `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`, which results in incorrect values for `m` and `k` that do not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

Specifically, for `n = 6`:
- The program computes `m = (6 * 6 / 4 - 1) = 8` and `k = (6 * 6 / 4 + 1) = 10`.
- The expected output should be (8, 10), which does form a Pythagorean triple with `6` (since 6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2).
However, if we take another even case like `n = 2`:
- The program will output `-1`, which is correct.
- However, for `n = 8`, it outputs `15, 17`, which does not satisfy the Pythagorean triple requirement as `8^2 + 15^2 â‰  17^2`.

Thus, due to this inconsistency in handling even integers and not covering all possible Pythagorean triples correctly, the program is incorrect.
