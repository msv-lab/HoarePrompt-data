The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are taken from user input, which means their specific values are not known until the input is provided. Therefore, `p` will be updated to include this new tuple, but the exact contents will depend on the user input. The other variables `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` is now [(fi, ti)], `i` is 1, and `p` is updated to include the new tuple (fi, ti).**
