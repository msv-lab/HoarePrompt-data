Postcondition: ***`p` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, with (0, 0) appended; `time_passed` is updated based on the calculation from `s` and `p[i][0]`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is increased by the difference `p[i][1] - time_passed`, ensuring that it becomes equal to `p[i][1]`. If `time_passed` is already greater than or equal to `p[i][1]`, it remains unchanged. `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is 2, with `s` being equal to `p[2][0]`.***
