The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The previous state of the variables indicates that `p` is an empty list, and `fi` and `ti` are integers from user input, meaning they have specific integer values that are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, after executing the code, `p` will contain one element, which is the tuple `(fi, ti)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` is now [(fi, ti)], `i` is 0, `fi` is an integer from user input, `ti` is an integer from user input**
