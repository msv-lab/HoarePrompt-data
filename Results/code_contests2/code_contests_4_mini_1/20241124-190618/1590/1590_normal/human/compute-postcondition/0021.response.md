Postcondition: ***`p` is a sorted list of tuples based on the first element of each tuple in descending order with (0, 0) appended; `time_passed` is updated to `p[0][1]` if it was less than `p[0][1]`. The variables `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, and `s` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 of `p`. If `time_passed` was already equal to or greater than `p[0][1]`, it remains unchanged.***
