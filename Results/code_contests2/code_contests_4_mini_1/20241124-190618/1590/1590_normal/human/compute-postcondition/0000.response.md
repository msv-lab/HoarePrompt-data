The code takes input values for `n` and `s` using `raw_input()` and assigns them after converting them to integers with `map(int, ...)`. The variables `n` and `s` will be updated with the input values, but their specific values are not known at this moment. Other variables in the initial state remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, and the function updates `n` and `s` with input values.**
