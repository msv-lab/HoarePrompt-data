According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased to 3, and `n` must be at least 3 (since `i` needs to be less than `n`).

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 3, and `i` should be set to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` is updated to include the new tuple (`fi`, `ti`), `i` is 3**
