According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least -1, as the range function `range(n + 1)` will produce an iterable from 0 to `n` (inclusive). Given that `time_passed` is 0, it is not directly affecting the loop execution.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `n` to at least 0. Additionally, since the loop starts with `i` at 0, we need to include that in the state.

State: **`p` is a sorted list of tuples based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, with the new tuple (0, 0) appended; `time_passed` is 0; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is 0**
