The code `p.append((fi, ti))` adds a new tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The initial state does not specify the current contents of `p`, but it indicates that `p` is being updated with a new tuple. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged by this action. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `p` with the new tuple added, while the other variables stay the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` is updated to include the new tuple (`fi`, `ti`), `i` is 2**
