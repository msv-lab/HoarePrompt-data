Postcondition: ***`p` is a sorted list of tuples based on the first element of each tuple in descending order with (0, 0) appended. If `time_passed` is less than `p[1][1]`, then `time_passed` is updated to the value of `p[1][1]`. Otherwise, `time_passed` remains unchanged. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 of `p`.***
