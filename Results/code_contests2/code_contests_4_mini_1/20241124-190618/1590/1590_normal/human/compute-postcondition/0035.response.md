The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it relies on internal data or context to perform its operations. After executing the function body, it returns information based on the conditions related to passengers' floors and arrival times. 

Since the details of the output based on these conditions were not provided, we cannot specify the exact return values. However, based on the constraints, we can summarize that the function interacts with passenger-related data involving floors and arrival times while adhering to the stated integer constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on internal data about passengers' floors and arrival times, returning relevant information based on the conditions defined.**
