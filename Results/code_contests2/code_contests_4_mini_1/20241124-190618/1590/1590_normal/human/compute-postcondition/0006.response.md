The code assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by taking user input and splitting it into two integers. The previous values of `fi` and `ti` are unspecified, but they are now replaced with the values from the input. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `fi` and `ti` have new values based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` is now [(fi, ti)], `i` is 1, `fi` is an integer from user input, `ti` is an integer from user input**
