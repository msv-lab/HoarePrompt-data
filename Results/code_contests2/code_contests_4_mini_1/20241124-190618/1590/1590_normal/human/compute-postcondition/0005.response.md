According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted because it remains within the specified range.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` is now [(fi, ti)], `i` is 1, `fi` is an integer from user input, `ti` is an integer from user input**
