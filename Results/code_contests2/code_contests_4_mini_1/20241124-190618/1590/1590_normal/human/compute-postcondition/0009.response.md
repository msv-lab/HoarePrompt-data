The code assigns the values of `fi` and `ti` from the input, which is processed using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The input is expected to provide two integers separated by space, which will be converted to integers and assigned to `fi` and `ti`, respectively. The variable `p` will be updated to include the new tuple `(fi, ti)`. The previous values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `fi` and `ti` as well as the updated list `p`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` is now updated to include the new tuple (`fi`, `ti`), `i` is 2**
