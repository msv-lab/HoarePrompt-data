The variable `p` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `s`, along with the new state of `p`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, and `p` is an empty list**
