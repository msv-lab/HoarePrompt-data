The code appends the tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. Since `p` is either an empty list (if `n` is 0) or a sorted list of tuples (if `n` is between 1 and 100), the operation will affect the contents of `p` accordingly. The insertion of `(0, 0)` will change `p` to include this new tuple. 

If `p` was initially empty (when `n` is 0), `p` will now contain one tuple: `[(0, 0)]`. If `p` contained tuples (when `n` is between 1 and 100), the new tuple will be added to the existing list but will not affect the sorting order because it will be appended at the end.

Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`p` is a sorted list of tuples based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, with the new tuple (0, 0) appended.**
