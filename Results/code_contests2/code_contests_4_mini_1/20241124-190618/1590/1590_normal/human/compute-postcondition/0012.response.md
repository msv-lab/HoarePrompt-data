Output State: **`p` is a list containing `n` tuples of integers where each tuple consists of two integers (`fi`, `ti`) inputted by the user. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `p` remains an empty list. If `n` is between 1 and 100, then `p` will contain exactly `n` tuples after the loop's execution.**
