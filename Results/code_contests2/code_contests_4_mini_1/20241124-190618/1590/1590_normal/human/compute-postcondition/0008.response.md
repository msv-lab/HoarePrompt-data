According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 in the next iteration. Since `i` is currently 1, we need to ensure `i` is less than `n` for the loop to continue executing. There are no adjustments needed for `n` since it is within the defined range.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` is now [(fi, ti)], `i` is 2, and `p` is updated to include the new tuple (fi, ti).**
