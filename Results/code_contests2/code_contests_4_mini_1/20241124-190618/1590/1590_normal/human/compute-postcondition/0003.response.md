The code assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by taking input from the user, which is split into two parts and converted to integers. The variables `n`, `s`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `fi` and `ti` are now assigned values based on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `fi` and `ti` are integers from user input**
