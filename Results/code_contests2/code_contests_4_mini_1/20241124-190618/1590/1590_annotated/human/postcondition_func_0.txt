The function reads two integers from input, where the first integer `n` indicates the number of tuples to be read. Each tuple consists of two integers. It processes these tuples to calculate the total time passed based on a specific logic involving the second elements of the tuples and a starting value `s`. The function then prints the total time passed. It does not handle cases where `n` is zero or negative, which would result in no input being read or processed.
