The code assigns the values of `n` and `s` from user input, where the input is split into two integers. Since no changes are made to other variables, the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, and both are assigned values based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000**
