The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the constraints: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, and each passenger is represented by a tuple (fi, ti) where fi is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ fi ≤ s and ti is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ ti ≤ 1000. 

The output functionality is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, without further details on the return value, it cannot be determined what the function outputs based on the inputs.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and operates on predefined constraints. The specific output functionality is not provided.**
