The code snippet assigns values to `fi` and `ti` using the `map` function to convert the split input from `raw_input()` into integers. The previous values of `fi` and `ti` are unknown since they will be replaced by the new input values. The tuple `p` will now contain the newly assigned values of `fi` and `ti`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `fi` and `ti` being assigned.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` now contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer**
