The code initializes `p` as an empty list. The variables `n` and `s` are not affected by this operation, and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `s`, along with the new state of `p`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, and `p` is an empty list.**
