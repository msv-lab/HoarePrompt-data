The list `p` is modified by appending a tuple containing the values of `fi` and `ti`. Since `fi` and `ti` are input integers, their values will be added as a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` now contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` now contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer.**
