According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n + 1`, which is not allowed since `i` cannot be greater than `n` in the context of the loop's range. Additionally, `n` is already a positive integer between 1 and 100, so it does not need to be adjusted. 

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to change `i` to `n + 1` to indicate that `i` is prepared for the next iteration, but since the loop won't execute again, we can conclude that it effectively cannot continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `i` is equal to `n`, and `p` contains the updated tuple (fi, ti)**
