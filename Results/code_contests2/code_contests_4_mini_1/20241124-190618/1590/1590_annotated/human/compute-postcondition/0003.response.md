The variables `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input that is split and converted to integers. The `raw_input()` function accepts user input, which will be processed as two integers. The values of `fi` and `ti` are not known until the input is provided. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `p`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `fi` and `ti` are now assigned integer values from the input, while the remaining variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer**
