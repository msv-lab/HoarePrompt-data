According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop continues executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `i` must be adjusted to determine if the loop can execute again.

Since the loop has just finished executing, the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration would be `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`, so it needs to be adjusted to `n`. 

Next, since `n` is a positive integer and the loop is currently at its last value of `i`, to allow for the loop to execute again, we can assume `n` can still remain the same, but we must ensure that `i` is now equal to `n` for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to `n`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `n` and `s` are already within their defined ranges.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `i` is equal to `n`, `p` contains the updated tuple `(fi, ti)`**
