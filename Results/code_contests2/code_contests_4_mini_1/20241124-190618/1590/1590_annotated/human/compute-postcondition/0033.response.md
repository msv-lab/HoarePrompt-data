Output State: **`time_passed` is the cumulative sum of `s - p[i][0]` for each `i` from 0 to `n`, updated by `p[i][1]` if `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`. `s` ends as `p[n][0]`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `time_passed` remains 0 while `s` remains unchanged. `p` is a list where each `p[i]` contains at least two elements.**
