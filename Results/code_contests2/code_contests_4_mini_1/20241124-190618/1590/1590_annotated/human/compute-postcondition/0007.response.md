The code appends the tuple `(fi, ti)` to the existing list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are derived from input integers but are not specified in the initial state. The state of `n` and `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `p` after the new tuple has been appended.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` now contains the tuple `(fi, ti)` and has been updated to include the new tuple.**
