The code appends a new tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `p` is updated to include the new tuple. Therefore, the output state reflects that `p` now contains the previously existing elements plus the newly appended tuple `(fi, ti)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `i` is equal to `n`, and `p` contains the updated tuple `(fi, ti)`**
