According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the loop will execute for `n` iterations, starting from `i = 0` and going up to `i = n - 1`. Before the loop starts, the list `p` is empty, but the loop execution does not depend on its contents. Thus, the only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are the values of `i` at the beginning of the first iteration and the indication that `n` is a valid positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
