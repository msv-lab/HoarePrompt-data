The code `p.append((0, 0))` adds a new tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. The initial state mentions that `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of the tuples, but appending a new tuple does not affect the ordering until sorting is applied again. The values of `n`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not impacted by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 1; `i` is equal to `n`; `s` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000; `p` is now sorted in descending order with an additional tuple `(0, 0)` at the end.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1; `i` is equal to `n`; `s` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000; `p` is now sorted in descending order with an additional tuple `(0, 0)` at the end.**
