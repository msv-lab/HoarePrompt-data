The code assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input()` accepts a string of space-separated integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. Since the previous values of `fi` and `ti` are not known, we cannot specify their values after execution. Other variables (`n`, `s`, `i`, `p`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `i` is equal to `n`, `p` contains the updated tuple `(fi, ti)` where `fi` and `ti` are integers from input.**
