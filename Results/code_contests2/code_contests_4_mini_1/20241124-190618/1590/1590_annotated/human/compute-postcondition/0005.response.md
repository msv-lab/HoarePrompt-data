According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and it must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 0, it will execute again as long as `n` is greater than 1. 

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged since it is still in the specified range. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` now contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer.**
