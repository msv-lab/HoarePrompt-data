Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is `p[i][0]`, if `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is updated to equal `p[i][1]`. If `time_passed` was already equal to or greater than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` remains unchanged. Additionally, `p` is a list where `p[i]` contains at least two elements.***
