Correctness: **False**

The given program has several issues that do not align with the problem description, specifically in its logic to compute the minimum number of subtractions required to reduce the magic number to zero.

1. The program accepts input as a string, but it does not convert it to an integer type. Thus, any arithmetic operations performed on `n` will result in a TypeError.

2. The logic to calculate the number of operations is flawed. The program only checks if `n % 10` is not equal to zero to determine if an additional operation is needed, which is not a comprehensive approach. The subtraction operation needs to consider all digits in `n`, and it is not guaranteed that just doubling the quotient of `n` divided by 10 and adding `s` would yield the correct number of subtractions.

3. The program does not handle the case when `n = 0`. According to the problem description, if the magic number is already zero, no operations are needed, but the current implementation would yield a result of 0, which is correct but not explicitly handled.

In summary, since the program does not accurately implement the logic required to count the minimum number of subtractions for all potential cases, it does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.
