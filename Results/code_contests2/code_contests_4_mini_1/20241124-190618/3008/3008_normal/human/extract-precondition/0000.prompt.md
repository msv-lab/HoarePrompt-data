You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Yet another Armageddon is coming! This time the culprit is the Julya tribe calendar. 

The beavers in this tribe knew math very well. Smart Beaver, an archaeologist, got a sacred plate with a magic integer on it. The translation from Old Beaverish is as follows: 

"May the Great Beaver bless you! May your chacres open and may your third eye never turn blind from beholding the Truth! Take the magic number, subtract a digit from it (the digit must occur in the number) and get a new magic number. Repeat this operation until a magic number equals zero. The Earth will stand on Three Beavers for the time, equal to the number of subtractions you perform!"

Distinct subtraction sequences can obviously get you different number of operations. But the Smart Beaver is ready to face the worst and is asking you to count the minimum number of operations he needs to reduce the magic number to zero.

Input

The single line contains the magic integer n, 0 ≤ n.

  * to get 20 points, you need to solve the problem with constraints: n ≤ 106 (subproblem C1); 
  * to get 40 points, you need to solve the problem with constraints: n ≤ 1012 (subproblems C1+C2); 
  * to get 100 points, you need to solve the problem with constraints: n ≤ 1018 (subproblems C1+C2+C3). 

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum number of subtractions that turns the magic number to a zero.

Examples

Input

24


Output

5

Note

In the first test sample the minimum number of operations can be reached by the following sequence of subtractions: 

24 → 20 → 18 → 10 → 9 → 0
Program:
```

def func():
    n = input()
    s = 0
    if n % 10 != 0:
        s = 1
    print(2 * (n / 10) + s)
```
