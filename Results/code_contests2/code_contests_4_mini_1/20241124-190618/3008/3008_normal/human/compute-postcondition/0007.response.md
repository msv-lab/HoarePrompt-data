The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an input value `n` as a string from the user without validating whether `n` is a non-negative integer. It then initializes a variable `s` to 0 and checks if `n` is not divisible by 10. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it sets `s` to 1. Subsequently, the function attempts to perform a calculation that involves dividing `n` by 10, multiplying the result by 2, and adding `s`. However, since `n` is obtained as a string, this division will result in a `TypeError` unless `n` is explicitly converted to an integer.

The potential edge cases include:
- If the input is not a valid number (e.g., letters or special characters), the function will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert it to an integer.
- If the input is a non-negative integer represented as a string, the function will execute without error, but if `n` is 0, the output will be `s`, which is 0, since `0/10` is 0 and `s` remains 0.
- If `n` is a positive integer that is divisible by 10, `s` will remain 0, and the output will reflect the division of `n` by 10 multiplied by 2.

Functionality: ** The function reads a string input from the user, checks if it is not divisible by 10, and sets a flag accordingly. It then attempts to compute and print a value based on this input, but it may fail with a `TypeError` unless the input is converted to an integer. If the input is invalid, it will raise a `ValueError`. **
