The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input from the user as a string. Since `n` was previously a non-negative integer, its type changes from an integer to a string. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer (now a string).

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer (now a string)**
