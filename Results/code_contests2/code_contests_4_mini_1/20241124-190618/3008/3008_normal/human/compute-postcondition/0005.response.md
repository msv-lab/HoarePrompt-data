The code snippet calculates the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s` using the values of `n` and `s`. The variable `n` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, so it needs to be converted to an integer before performing the division. The value of `s` is determined by whether `n` is divisible by 10 or not.

1. If `n` is not divisible by 10, then `s` is set to 1.
2. If `n` is divisible by 10, then `s` remains 0.

The expression evaluates as follows:
- Convert `n` from string to integer.
- If `n` is divisible by 10, compute `2 * (n / 10) + 0`.
- If `n` is not divisible by 10, compute `2 * (n / 10) + 1`.

However, the output of the `print` statement does not change the state of `n` and `s`. Therefore, we will state their current conditions based on the divisibility of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer (string); if `n` is not divisible by 10, then `s` is 1; if `n` is divisible by 10, then `s` is 0; the result of the print statement is evaluated but not stored.**
