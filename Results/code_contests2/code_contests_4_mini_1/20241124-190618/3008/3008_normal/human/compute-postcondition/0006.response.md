The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on a non-negative integer `n` which is presumably defined within the function or the context in which it is called. Since there is no specific output provided in the output section, we cannot determine the exact return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function func cannot be clearly defined without additional information regarding its output. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. The return value is undetermined based on the provided information.**
