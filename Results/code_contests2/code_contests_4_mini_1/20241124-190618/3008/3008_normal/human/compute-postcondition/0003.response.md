The value of `s` is assigned the value `1`. The initial value of `s` was `0`, but it is now updated to `1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and its previous condition (non-negative integer, not divisible by 10) still holds. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer (string), `s` is 1, and `n` is not divisible by 10.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer (string), `s` is 1, and `n` is not divisible by 10**
