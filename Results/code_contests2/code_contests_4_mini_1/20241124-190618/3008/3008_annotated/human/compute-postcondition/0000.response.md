The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input as a string. Since `n` is initially a non-negative integer, the output state will reflect that `n` is now a string representing the user input. The previous value of `n` as a non-negative integer is overwritten. 

Output State: **`n` is a string input from the user**
