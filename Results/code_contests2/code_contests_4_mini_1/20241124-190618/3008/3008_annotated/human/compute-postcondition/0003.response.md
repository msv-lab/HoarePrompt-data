The value of `s` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `s` was `0`, so now `s` is updated to `1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string input from the user, and the last digit of the integer representation of `n` is not 0; `s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a string input from the user, and the last digit of the integer representation of `n` is not 0; `s` is 1**
