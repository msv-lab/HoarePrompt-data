The function `func` takes no parameters and prompts the user to input a value for `n`. The input is treated as a string, and when checking the condition, it is not converted to an integer for the modulus operation, which can lead to an error. The function attempts to determine if the last digit of `n` is not zero (which should be checked on its integer form) and sets the variable `s` to 1 if that is the case; otherwise, `s` remains 0. 

The function then attempts to print the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`. However, since `n` is a string, this will cause a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations involving `n`.

Additionally, the function does not have any return statement, making its return behavior unspecified.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to read a string input from the user and attempt to compute a value based on that input, but it will always result in an error due to the incorrect handling of the string type for arithmetic operations. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, reads a string input from the user, and attempts to perform arithmetic operations on it, which will lead to a TypeError due to the lack of integer conversion. It does not return any value. **
