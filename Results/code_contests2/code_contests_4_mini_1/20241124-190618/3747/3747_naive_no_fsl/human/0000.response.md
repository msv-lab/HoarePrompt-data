Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The main issue is that it only handles a specific case (`if n == 11: print(5)`), which suggests that the program is hardcoded for that specific input and does not account for other potential cases correctly.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
In this case, Polycarp has five coins of the same value (1). The expected output should be `5`, as he needs a separate pocket for each coin to avoid placing two coins of the same value in the same pocket.

However, the program would process the input and `c` would become `[0, 5, 0, 0, ..., 0]` and `print(max(c))` would incorrectly yield `5`, which is the correct output here, but because of the hardcoded case, it would not work for other unique distributions of coins where hardcoding is not applicable.

Another example:
```
4
2 2 2 3
```
The expected output here would be `3` because two coins of value `2` can go into two pockets and the coin of value `3` can go into either pocket. 

The program's reliance on a specific case and its lack of a general solution leads to incorrect functioning for various inputs, thereby making it overall incorrect according to the problem description. 

Thus, the program does not cover all cases as required, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
