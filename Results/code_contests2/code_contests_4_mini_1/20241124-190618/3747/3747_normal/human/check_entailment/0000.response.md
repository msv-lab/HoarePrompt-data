The provided program attempts to determine the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute his coins, given the constraint that no two coins of the same value can be placed in the same pocket. 

### Initial Assessment:
- The program first checks if `n` is exactly 11 and prints 5 if this condition is met. This seems like a hardcoded case that does not align with the general problem description, which does not mention any special case for `n = 11`.
- The program then counts occurrences of each integer in the list `a` using the `c` array. The final output is the maximum count, which represents the number of times the most common coin value appears. This is a reasonable approach since that will dictate the minimum number of pockets required.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Input Size**: The code does not validate the input size `n` against the specified constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). If `n` were to be zero or negative, the behavior is undefined.
2. **Coin Values**: The code does not validate that all coin values are within the specified range (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100). If the values fall outside this range, the counting may yield incorrect results.
3. **Hardcoded Output**: The special case for `n = 11` is a significant flaw as it does not conform to the general rule, and it could lead to incorrect results for inputs that should be otherwise handled.

### Output Hints:
- The hints state that the function prints 5 if `n` is exactly 11, which agrees with the hardcoded aspect of the code.
- The hints also mention potential undefined behavior if `n` is 0 or less than 1, which is indeed a valid concern based on the code.
- However, the hints do not address the handling of coin values outside the range [1, 100], which can affect the correctness.

### Conclusion:
Given the hardcoded output for `n = 11`, the lack of input validation, and the potential for incorrect outputs when coin values exceed the allowed range, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly handle various edge cases, particularly the hardcoded condition for `n = 11`, which does not follow the general rule of the problem description.
