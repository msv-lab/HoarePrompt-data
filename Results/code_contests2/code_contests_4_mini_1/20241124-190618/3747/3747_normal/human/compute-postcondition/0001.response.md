The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created from the input, where the input consists of `n` integers separated by spaces. The previous state indicates that `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, which means the list `a` will contain `n` integers, each ranging from 1 to 100. The values of `a` will be determined by the input provided during execution.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100 based on input.**
