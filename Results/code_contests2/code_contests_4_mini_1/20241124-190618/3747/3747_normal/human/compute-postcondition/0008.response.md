According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the list `a`. The variable `d` takes on the value of each element in `a` in each iteration. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `d` is equal to `a[0]`, and the loop has executed at least once. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be set to the next element in the list `a`. Since `n` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, and `a` contains `n` integers, if the loop has executed with `d` being the first element, the next value of `d` should be the second element in the list.

Thus, we need to adjust `d` to be the next integer in the list `a`, which would be `a[1]`. The index of `d` would also need to be adjusted to reflect this.

State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, `d` is `a[1]`, and `c[d]` is increased by 1**
