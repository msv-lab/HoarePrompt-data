Output State: **`c` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer from list `a`, satisfying `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes at least once and `d` will be the first element of `a`, and `c[d]` will be incremented by 1. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `c` remains a list of 101 zeros.**
