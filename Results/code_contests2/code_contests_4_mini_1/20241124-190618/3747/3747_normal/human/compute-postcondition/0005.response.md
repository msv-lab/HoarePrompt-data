The code initializes a list `c` with 101 zeros. This operation does not affect the previous values of `n` or `a`, as the list creation is independent. The variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 zeros.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 zeros**
