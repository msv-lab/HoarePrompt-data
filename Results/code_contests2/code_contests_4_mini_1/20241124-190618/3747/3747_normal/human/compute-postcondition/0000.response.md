The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. The `raw_input()` function will accept an input, and `int()` will convert that input to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer in the range of 1 to 100, but since `raw_input()` will prompt for input, the actual value of `n` will depend on the user's input. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, which satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100.**
