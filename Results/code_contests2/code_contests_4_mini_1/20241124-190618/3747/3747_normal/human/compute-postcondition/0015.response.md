The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100. The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the defined logic. However, the specific output based on the input parameters hasn't been provided in the output description. Therefore, we can only describe the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer satisfies (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100).**
