The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100). It prints 5 if `n` is exactly 11. Then, it counts the occurrences of each integer from 1 to 100 in the list `a`, and finally, it prints the maximum count of occurrences of any integer from that list. If `n` is 0 or less than 1, the function has no defined behavior since input validation is not present, and if `n` is greater than 0 but all elements in `a` are not within the specified range, the result may be inaccurate.
