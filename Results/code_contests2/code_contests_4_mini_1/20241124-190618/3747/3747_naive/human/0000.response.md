Correctness: **False**. 

The program is supposed to distribute coins into the minimum number of pockets without putting two coins of the same value into the same pocket. However, it only handles a specific case when `n == 11` by incorrectly returning `5`. The logic to count the maximum occurrence of any coin value is not sufficient to solve the problem, as it does not account for the distribution of the coins. 

For example, with the input:
```
6
1 2 4 3 3 2
```
The output should be `2`, since two pockets can hold `[1, 2, 3]` and `[2, 3, 4]`. However, the program incorrectly computes the number of pockets based on the maximum frequency of any coin, which is not the correct approach for all possible cases. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for various inputs, making it incorrect.
