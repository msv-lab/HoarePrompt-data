Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program has a hardcoded case for `n == 11`, where it prints `5`, which is arbitrary and does not derive from the actual logic needed to solve the problem. 

For example, consider the input:
```
11
1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5
```
In this case, the maximum occurrence of any coin is `3` (the number `3` appears three times), which means Polycarp would need `3` pockets to accommodate all coins without putting duplicates in the same pocket. However, the program would not reach the logic to determine this maximum for any input where `n` is not `11`, leading to a potential failure for other valid inputs.

Moreover, the program's logic to count occurrences using the list `c` is correct, but the initial condition and the hardcoded output drastically affect its correctness. If the input does not have `n` equal to `11`, the program does not output anything, which violates the requirements of the problem. 

Therefore, since the program does not meet the requirements for all potential inputs, it is deemed incorrect.
