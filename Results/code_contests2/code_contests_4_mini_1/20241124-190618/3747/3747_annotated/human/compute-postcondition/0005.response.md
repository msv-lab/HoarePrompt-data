The code initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. This operation creates a new list but does not affect the value of `n` or any other variables. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `n` while indicating the initialization of the list `c`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 elements, all set to 0**
