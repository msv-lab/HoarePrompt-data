Output State: **`c` is a list where each element at index `i` (0 ≤ `i` ≤ 100) represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in iterable `a`. If `a` contains integers only within the range 0 to 100, then the loop will execute, and each corresponding index in `c` will be incremented based on the elements in `a`. If `a` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `c` remains a list of zeros. If `a` contains integers outside the range 0 to 100, this will lead to an index error. Therefore, it's assumed that `a` should only contain valid integers within the specified range for the loop to work correctly.**
