Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n`, which is expected to be between 1 and 100, and a list of integers `a`. If `n` is exactly 11, it prints the number 5. It then counts the occurrences of each integer from 0 to 100 in the list `a` and prints the maximum count found. However, if any integer in `a` is outside the range of 0 to 100, it will lead to an index error when updating the count. The function does not handle this potential error and assumes all integers in `a` are valid.**
