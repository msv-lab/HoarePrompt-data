The code `c[d] += 1` increments the element at index `d` of the list `c` by 1. The value of `d` is determined by the second element of the iterable `a`. Since `a` has at least 2 elements, `d` will hold a valid integer index for the list `c`. The only variable affected by this code is `c`, which will have the value at index `d` increased by 1. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `c` has the element at index `d` incremented by 1; `a` is an iterable with at least 2 elements; `d` is the second element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `c` has the element at index `d` incremented by 1; `a` is an iterable with at least 2 elements; `d` is the second element of `a`.**
