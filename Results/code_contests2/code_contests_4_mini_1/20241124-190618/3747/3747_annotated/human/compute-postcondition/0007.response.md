The value of `d` is the first element of `a`, and since `c` is a list of 101 elements all initialized to 0, the execution of `c[d] += 1` increments the value at index `d` in the list `c` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the list `c`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `c` is a list with the element at index `d` incremented by 1, `a` is an iterable with at least 1 element, `d` is the first element of `a`**.
