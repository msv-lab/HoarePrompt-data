The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into parts by spaces. The `raw_input()` accepts a line of input, which is then split into individual strings representing integers, and `int` converts each of these strings to an integer. The previous value of `n` is unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is that `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100, and `a` is now a list of integers created from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers created from the input.**
