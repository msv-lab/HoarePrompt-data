Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks if string S can be obtained by rotating string T. It does this by generating all possible rotations of T and comparing each one with S. The use of the expression `(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))` effectively checks each rotation of T by slicing it at every index and concatenating the two parts. 

Given the constraints that both strings have the same length and consist of lowercase English letters, the program is guaranteed to handle all valid inputs according to the problem description. For any case where S can be formed by rotating T, it will return "Yes," and for cases where it cannot, it will return "No." Thus, it satisfies all potential edge cases and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
