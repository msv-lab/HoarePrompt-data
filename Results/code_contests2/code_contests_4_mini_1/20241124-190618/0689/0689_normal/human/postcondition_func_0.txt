The function accepts two string inputs from the user, compares them, and checks if one string can be obtained by rotating the other string. It prints 'Yes' if the second string is a rotation of the first string, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the lengths of the strings differ, which would always result in 'No'.
