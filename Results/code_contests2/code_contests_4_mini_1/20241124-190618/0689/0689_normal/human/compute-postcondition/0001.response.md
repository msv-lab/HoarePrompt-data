The variable `t` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which accepts an input string. The initial values of `S` and `T` remain unchanged, and the input string `s` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `S` and `T` are strings of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|; `t` is an input string.

Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|; `t` is an input string**
