To determine the correctness of the provided program, letâ€™s analyze the problem description, the code, and the output hints.

**Problem description:** We need to determine if string S equals string T after performing a rotation operation any number of times. The operation consists of taking the last character of S and moving it to the front.

**Program:**
```python
s = raw_input()
t = raw_input()
print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]
```

**Output hints:** The function checks if one string can be obtained by rotating the other string. It prints 'Yes' if the second string is a rotation of the first string, and 'No' otherwise. It does not explicitly handle cases where the lengths of the strings differ, which would always result in 'No'.

### Initial assessment:
1. The code accepts two strings `s` and `t`.
2. It checks if any rotation of `t` equals `s` by iterating through all possible rotations.
3. The expression `t[i:] + t[:i]` effectively generates all rotations of `t`.
4. If a match is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

### Potential edge cases:
- The program does not explicitly handle cases where the lengths of the strings differ. However, the problem description guarantees that `|S| = |T|`, so this case should not occur under normal circumstances given the constraints.
- It also does not handle cases where either string is empty since the constraints specify a minimum length of 2.

### Output hints verification:
- The output hints correctly describe the intended functionality of the code.
- The hints mention that it does not handle differing lengths, which is aligned with our understanding. However, since the constraints ensure equal lengths, this issue may not affect correctness for valid input.

### Conclusion:
Given that the constraints of the problem description state that the lengths of S and T will always be equal, the program correctly checks for rotations of T to match S. There are no cases under the given constraints where the program would return an incorrect result.

Thus, after evaluating the code against the problem description and considering the output hints, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program accurately determines if one string is a rotation of another under the specified conditions.
