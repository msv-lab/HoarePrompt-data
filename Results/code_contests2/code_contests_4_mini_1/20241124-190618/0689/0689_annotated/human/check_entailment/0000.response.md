To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and understand its logic.

The problem requires us to determine if string S can be obtained from string T through a series of rotations. The rotation operation described takes the last character of the string and moves it to the front, effectively rotating the string.

The provided code is as follows:

```python
def func():
    s = raw_input()
    t = raw_input()
    print['No', 'Yes'][any(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))]
```

### Analyzing the Code

1. **Input Handling**: 
    - The program takes two strings `s` and `t` as input from standard input. Note that `raw_input()` is used, which suggests this code is for Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead.

2. **Rotation Logic**:
    - The expression `t[i:] + t[:i]` constructs a new string that represents T rotated by `i` positions.
    - `any(...)` checks if any of these rotations of T equals S. If at least one rotation matches S, it returns `True`; otherwise, `False`.

3. **Output**:
    - The program outputs 'Yes' if S can be obtained by rotating T and 'No' otherwise. This is done using `print['No', 'Yes'][...]`, which is a somewhat unconventional method of outputting but is valid.

### Edge Cases

Now, we should check for potential edge cases:

1. **Identical Strings**: 
    - For input `s = "abc"` and `t = "abc"`, the output should be 'Yes' because they are identical and thus S can be considered a rotation of T (0 rotations).

2. **Maximum Length**: 
    - For strings of maximum length (100 characters), e.g., `s = "a" * 100` and `t = "a" * 100`, it should return 'Yes'.

3. **Non-Rotatable Strings**:
    - For input `s = "abc"` and `t = "def"`, the output should be 'No'.

4. **Different Lengths**: 
    - Although the constraints guarantee equal lengths, if we modify inputs to `s = "ab"` and `t = "abc"`, it should not compile and should fail.

5. **Various Rotations**:
    - For input `s = "kyoto"` and `t = "tokyo"`, it should return 'Yes' upon checking all rotations.

### Conclusion

Upon reviewing the logic and edge cases, the code correctly implements the rotation check as described in the problem statement. The code handles all specified scenarios, including identical strings, different strings, and the rotation checks appropriately.

Therefore, based on the analysis:

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly checks if S equals T after any number of rotations, satisfying all conditions laid out in the problem description.
