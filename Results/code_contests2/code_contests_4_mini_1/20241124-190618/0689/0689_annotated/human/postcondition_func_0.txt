The function accepts two strings, `s` and `t`, which are read from user input. It checks if the string `s` can be obtained by rotating the string `t`. If `s` is a rotation of `t`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not handle cases where the lengths of `s` and `t` are not equal, which would lead to incorrect behavior since it assumes both inputs are of equal length.
