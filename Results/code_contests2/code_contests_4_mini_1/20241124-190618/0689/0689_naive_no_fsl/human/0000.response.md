Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a bug in the way it checks for string rotation. The core logic of the program is to check if any rotation of string `T` equals string `S`. However, the way it constructs the new strings for comparison is incorrect.

The line:
```python
print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]
```
is intended to check every rotation of `T` to see if it equals `S`. However, it incorrectly uses a list indexing method which can lead to unexpected behavior. 

For example, if `S` is `"abc"` and `T` is `"cba"`, the expected output should be `"No"` since there is no rotation of `T` that would equal `S`. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly because it doesn't compare all possible rotations properly due to its flawed structure.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly determine if `S` equals `T` after rotation for all possible inputs, which violates the correctness requirement.
