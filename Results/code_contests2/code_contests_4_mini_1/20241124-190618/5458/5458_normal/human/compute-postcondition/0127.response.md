The code snippet updates a multidimensional array `dp` at the indices calculated using the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, which is equal to `N`, a positive integer between 1 and 7.
2. The expression `i + 1 & 1` calculates the value of `i + 1` and then applies a bitwise AND with `1`. This operation will yield either `0` or `1` depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd.
3. `j` is equal to `1`, so `j + 1` will be `2`.
4. `k` is equal to `2`.

Thus, `dp` will be updated at indices `[0 or 1][2][2]` (depending on `i` being odd or even) to the value `1`.

The other variables `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged as this operation only affects the `dp` array.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the effect on the `dp` array:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is equal to `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]` is set to 1**
