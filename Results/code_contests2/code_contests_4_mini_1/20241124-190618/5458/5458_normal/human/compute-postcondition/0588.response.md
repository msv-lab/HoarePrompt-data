According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. If `s` is at least 1, then the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `k` is at least 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `k` must be at least 2 at the start of the next iteration. Also, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `s`, which means `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `k` should be incremented to at least 2.
- `s` should be at least 2.

State: **`dp` is updated based on the relationships between `j` and `k`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2**
