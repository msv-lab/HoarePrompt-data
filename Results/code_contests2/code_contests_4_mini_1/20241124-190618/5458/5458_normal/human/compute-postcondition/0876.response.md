Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[1][2][1]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is updated to `dp[1][1][1]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is updated by adding `dp[i][j][k - j] % mod` to the previous value. This ensures all edge cases regarding the values of `j` and `k` are considered.***
