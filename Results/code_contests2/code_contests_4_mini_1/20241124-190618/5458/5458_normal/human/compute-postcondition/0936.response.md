Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. There are no changes to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`, but since the precondition guarantees that `j` is 3 and `k` is 1, the assignment will occur.***
