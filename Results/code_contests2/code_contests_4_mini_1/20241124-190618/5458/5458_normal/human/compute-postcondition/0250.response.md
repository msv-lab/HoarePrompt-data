Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged for all indices. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The loop executes `s` times if `s` is at least 1, and indices of `dp` are updated accordingly. If `s` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `dp` remains unchanged.**
