According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` should be incremented to 2, and we need to ensure that `k` remains less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, `s` must be at least 2 to allow `k` to take the value 2 in the next iteration.

State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp` is updated accordingly.**
