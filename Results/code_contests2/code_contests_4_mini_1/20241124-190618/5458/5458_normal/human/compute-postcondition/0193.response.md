Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0, and since `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding to it `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring the operations respect the boundaries of the indices. In this context, `dp` values are adjusted based on the conditions set forth by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
