The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates based on three input values: `N`, `M`, and `S`. The constraints are as follows: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. The function continues to process input until all three values, `N`, `M`, and `S`, are zero. The specific output behavior or return values of the function based on these inputs are not provided in the output description. Therefore, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters but processes inputs N, M, and S, which are positive integers constrained by specific ranges, until all three inputs are zero.**
