The value of `j` is 2 and the value of `k` is also 2. Since `j` is not greater than `k`, the condition is false, and there are no changes made to the variables or the array `dp`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 2, and there are no changes made to the variables or the array.**
