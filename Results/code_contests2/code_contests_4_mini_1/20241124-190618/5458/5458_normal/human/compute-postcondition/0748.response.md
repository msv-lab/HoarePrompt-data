The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables `s`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `i` do not change. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the indication that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is at least `s + 2`, `k` is 3, `i` is an integer, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
