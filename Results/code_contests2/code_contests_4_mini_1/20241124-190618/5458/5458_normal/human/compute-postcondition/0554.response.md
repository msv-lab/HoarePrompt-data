According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2. Therefore, the new state should reflect that `k` is now 2, while the other states remain unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2**
