According to the code, the loop can execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to 3. Additionally, since `k` should not exceed `s`, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` should be 3 to allow for the next iteration.
- `s` must be at least 3 to ensure that the loop can continue executing.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, and `k` is 3**
