The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged as this statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state lists the unchanged values of all relevant variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, `dp` is unchanged, and `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1)**
