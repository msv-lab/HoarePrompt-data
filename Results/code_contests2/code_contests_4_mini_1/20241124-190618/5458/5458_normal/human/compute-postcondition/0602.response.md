Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated such that if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains its previous value. Additionally, `k` must be within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive.***
