According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s` (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `s + 1`, which is outside the range for the loop (1 to `s`).

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be adjusted to be equal to `k - 1` since the loop runs as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Additionally, we should ensure that `k` can take the value of `1` in the next iteration.

Thus, the modified states should reflect that `s` is now equal to `k - 1`, and `k` is adjusted to `1` for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer equal to `k - 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is `1` now).**
