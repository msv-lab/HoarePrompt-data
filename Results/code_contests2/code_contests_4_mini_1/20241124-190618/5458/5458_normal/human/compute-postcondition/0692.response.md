Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 1`, `j` is at least `s + 1`, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. There are no changes to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` if `j` is less than `k`, but the conditions of `s`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
