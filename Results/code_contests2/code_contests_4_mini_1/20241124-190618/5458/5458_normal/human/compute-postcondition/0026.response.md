Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the operation on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is performed by assigning it the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes occur to `dp` and the next iteration may not be reached.***
