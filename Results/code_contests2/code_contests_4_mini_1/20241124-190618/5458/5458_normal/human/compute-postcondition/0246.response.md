Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod if j > k` or remains unchanged if `j` is less than or equal to `k`.**
