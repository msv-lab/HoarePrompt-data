Functionality: ** The function continuously processes input values for `n`, `m`, and `s`, which are expected to be positive integers, until all three input values are zero. It calculates a dynamic programming table based on these values and prints the result of a specific computation using this table. If all inputs are zero, the function terminates. The function does not accept parameters directly and relies on user input for its execution. Additionally, the function handles potential edge cases where `n`, `m`, and `s` can be zero, which serves as the termination condition for the loop. **
