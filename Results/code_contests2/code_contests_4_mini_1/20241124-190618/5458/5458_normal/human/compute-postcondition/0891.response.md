Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no change to `dp` and the current iteration ends without executing the if block.***
