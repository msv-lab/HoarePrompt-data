The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned from the input split into three integers. The initial values of `N`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are not directly affected by the code, but their assignments depend on the input provided. Since the values of `N`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers within specified ranges, the output state will reflect the new values of `n`, `m`, and `s` as integers from the input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000**
