The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change due to this statement. Therefore, the output state is: `i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
