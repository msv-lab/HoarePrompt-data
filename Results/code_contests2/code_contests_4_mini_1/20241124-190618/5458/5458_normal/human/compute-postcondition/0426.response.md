Postcondition: ***`N`, `n`, `m` are integers with values at least 3; `s` is at least 3; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp` and the current iteration completes without further action.***
