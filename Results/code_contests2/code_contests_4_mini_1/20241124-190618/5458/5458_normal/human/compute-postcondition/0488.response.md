Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `i` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while all other variables retain their values.***
