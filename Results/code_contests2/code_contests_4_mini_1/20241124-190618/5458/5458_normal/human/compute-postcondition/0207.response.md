The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same with the current values of the variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
