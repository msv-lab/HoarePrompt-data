Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the relationship between `j` and `k`, where if `j` (which is 2) is greater than `k` (which is at least 3), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds without this block of code executing.***
