Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `m` is at least `s + 1`, `j` is at least `s + 1`, `k` is 2, and `i` is an integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state of the program.***
