Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0 or greater, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the dp array is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the dp array.**
