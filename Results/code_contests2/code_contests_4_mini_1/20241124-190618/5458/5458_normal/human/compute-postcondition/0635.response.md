The code executes a `continue` statement, which skips the current iteration of the loop. The values of the variables `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `m`, `s`, and `k` are not changed by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables without any modification.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
