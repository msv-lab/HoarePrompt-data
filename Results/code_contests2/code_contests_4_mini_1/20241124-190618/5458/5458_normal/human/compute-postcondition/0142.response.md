Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is equal to `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and no changes are made to `dp`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
