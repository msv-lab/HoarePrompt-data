The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and move on to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables remain unchanged, the output state reflects that the program continues without modifying any of the variables.

Output State: **`N` retains its value, `n` retains its value, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][2][2] and the program continues to the next iteration.**
