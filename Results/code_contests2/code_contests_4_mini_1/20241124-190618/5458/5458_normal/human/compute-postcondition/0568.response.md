Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the state, and the current iteration of the loop continues.***
