The code contains a `continue` statement, which means that the current iteration of the loop will be skipped, and the next iteration will begin. The values of the variables do not change due to this statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, and we note that we are skipping to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
