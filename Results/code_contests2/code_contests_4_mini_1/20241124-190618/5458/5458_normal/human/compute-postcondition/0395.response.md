Postcondition: ***`N`, `n`, `m`, `s` retain their values; if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][3][3]` is set to the value of `dp[1][2][3]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][3]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[1][2][3]` and adding the modulo of `dp[0][2][0]` (where `0` is `k - j`).***
