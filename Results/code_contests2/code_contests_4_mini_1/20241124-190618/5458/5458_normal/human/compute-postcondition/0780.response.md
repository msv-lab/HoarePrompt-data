Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the value of `i`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` at index `[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, and `k` is `s + 1`. The postcondition encapsulates the logic for both branches and ensures that boundary conditions related to `j` and `k` are addressed appropriately.***
