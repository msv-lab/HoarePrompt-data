The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, there is no information indicating the presence of a loop in the provided context. Therefore, while the values of the variables do not change, we remain in the same state without progressing to the next iteration.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `i` is equal to `n`; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is equal to 1; `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 3; and `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3] = dp[i + 1 & 1][1][3] and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop, if present.**
