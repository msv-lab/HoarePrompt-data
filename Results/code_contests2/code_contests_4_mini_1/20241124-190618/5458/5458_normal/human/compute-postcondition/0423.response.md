Postcondition: ***`N`, `n`, `m` are integers with values at least 3; `s` is at least 3; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1. This handles the case where both `j` and `k` are equal to 3, ensuring that `dp[1][4][3]` is updated to 1 when the condition is met.***
