The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The condition states that this operation is only performed if `j` is greater than `k`. However, since `j` is 2 and `k` is also 2, the condition `j > k` is not satisfied. Therefore, there are no changes made to `dp`, and the state of the other variables remains the same.

Output State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `dp` is updated accordingly, and no changes made to `dp`.**
