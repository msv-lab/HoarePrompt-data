The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1), and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
