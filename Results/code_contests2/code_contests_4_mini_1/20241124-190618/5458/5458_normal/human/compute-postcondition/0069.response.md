Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0 or greater, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged as it is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration without any modifications to the other variables. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no action is taken and the state of `dp` is not modified.***
