To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration and consider the loop conditions.

1. The loop iterates over `k` in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

2. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is currently at its maximum value for the last iteration, which is `s`. 

3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, making the new value of `k` equal to `s + 1`. 

4. Since the loop is designed to iterate as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`, and `s` is at least `1`, no other states need adjustments. 

Therefore, we can summarize the adjustments needed:

State: **`dp` remains unchanged except at index `[1][j + 1][k]`, which is set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by assigning it the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`, or by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` otherwise. In all cases, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, and `k` is `s + 1`.**
