The code contains a `continue` statement, which does not change the values of the variables but skips the current iteration in a loop. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes occurred to the variables, but we indicate that the loop iteration is skipped.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least `s + 1`, `j` is at least `s + 1`, `k` is 3, `i` is an integer, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
