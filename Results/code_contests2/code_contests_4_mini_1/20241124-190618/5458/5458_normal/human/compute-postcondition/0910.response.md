Postcondition: ***`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp` is updated accordingly. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation and previous values in the `dp` array, where the index `k - j` must be valid to avoid indexing issues.***
