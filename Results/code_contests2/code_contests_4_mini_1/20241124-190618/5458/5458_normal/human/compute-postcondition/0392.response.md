Postcondition: ***`N`, `n`, `m`, `s` retain their values; `m` is at least 2; `s` is at least 3; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, maintaining the values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k`, and the array `dp` is updated accordingly. If `j` is not greater than `k`, this program fragment does not execute any changes.***
