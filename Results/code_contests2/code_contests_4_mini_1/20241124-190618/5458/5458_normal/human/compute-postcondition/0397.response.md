Output State: **`N`, `n`, `m` retain their values; `s` is at least 1; `i` is equal to 0; `j` is at least 2; `k` varies from 1 to `s`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and all values remain unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for each iteration. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop may not execute if `j` is not enough to satisfy the conditions set in the loop.**
