Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` equals `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the nearest loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there are no changes made in this block, and the program proceeds to any subsequent code.***
