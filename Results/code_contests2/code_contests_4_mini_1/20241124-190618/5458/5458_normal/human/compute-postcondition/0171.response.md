Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to the `dp` array.***
