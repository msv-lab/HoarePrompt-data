Postcondition: ***`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The overall updates to `dp` depend on the comparisons of `j` and `k` and the value of `i`.***
