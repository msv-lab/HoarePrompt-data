Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and if `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than 3, the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
