According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for `j` taking values from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have been equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `m + 1`. 

Since `j` takes values starting from 1 up to `m`, it is essential that `m` is at least 1 for the loop to run initially. Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

1. `j` must be adjusted to `m + 1` to allow for the next iteration.
2. `m` must remain at least 1 to permit the loop to execute.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop's execution is solely dependent on the value of `m` and the increment of `j`.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`**
