The values of the variables do not change but we continue with the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0 or greater, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
