Postcondition: ***`i` is not equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
