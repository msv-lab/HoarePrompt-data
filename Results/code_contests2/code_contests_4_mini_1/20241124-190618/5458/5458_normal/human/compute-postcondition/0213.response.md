Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is at least `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for each `k`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i][j][k - j]`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the values remain unchanged. Additionally, if `j` is less than 3, the loop will not execute, leaving the values of `dp` as they were before the loop.**
