The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but skips the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the knowledge that we are skipping to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `m` is at least `s + 1`, `j` is at least `s + 1`, `k` is 2, `i` is an integer, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
