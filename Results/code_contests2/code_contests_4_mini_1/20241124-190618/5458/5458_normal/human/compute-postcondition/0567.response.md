The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it skips the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the fact that we skip to the next iteration in the loop.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
