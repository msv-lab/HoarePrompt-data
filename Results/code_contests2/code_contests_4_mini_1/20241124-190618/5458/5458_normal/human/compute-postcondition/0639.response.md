Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is 0 and `j` (which is 2) is greater than or equal to `k` (which is at least 1), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and also includes an addition from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, subject to valid index access. Overall, the conditions maintain that `m` remains at least 2, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 1 throughout the execution.***
