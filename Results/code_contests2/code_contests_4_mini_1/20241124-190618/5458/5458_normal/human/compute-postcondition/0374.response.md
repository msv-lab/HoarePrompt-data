Postcondition: ***`N` retains its value, `n` retains its value, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
