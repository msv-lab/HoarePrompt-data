According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `k` is currently equal to `s`, which means the loop will not execute again unless `s` is adjusted to be greater than `k`. 

Therefore, to allow for one more iteration of the loop, we need to ensure that `s` is greater than `k`. As `k` can take values from 1 to `s`, we can adjust `s` to be at least `k + 1`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `s` should be greater than or equal to `k + 1` (which is `s` being at least `s + 1`).

No other states need to be adjusted since `N`, `n`, `m`, and `s` retain their values.

State: **`N` and `n` retain their values between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3001, `k` is less than or equal to `s`**
