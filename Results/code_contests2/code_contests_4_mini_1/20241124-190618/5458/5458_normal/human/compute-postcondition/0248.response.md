Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
