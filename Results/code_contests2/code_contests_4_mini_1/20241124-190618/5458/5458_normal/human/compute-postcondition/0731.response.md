Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is `s + 2`, `k` is 1, `i` is an integer and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no operation performed in this block.***
