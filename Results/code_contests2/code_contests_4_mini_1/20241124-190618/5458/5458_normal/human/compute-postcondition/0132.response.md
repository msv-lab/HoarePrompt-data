Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is equal to `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2; since `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made, and the program proceeds without executing the if block.**
