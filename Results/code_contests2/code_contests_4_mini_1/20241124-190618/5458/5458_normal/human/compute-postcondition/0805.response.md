Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, ensuring that the index `k - j` is valid. All other variables remain unchanged.***
