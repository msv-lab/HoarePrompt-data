According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The `xrange(1, s + 1)` function will produce a range of numbers from 1 to `s`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. 

Given that the initial state has `i` as `n`, `m` as greater than or equal to 1, and `j` as 1, these values do not directly affect the execution of the loop. The critical state to ensure the loop executes is the variable `s`.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `k` should start at 1.

State: **`i` is n, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
