Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures all scenarios involving the values of `j` and the index `i` are handled appropriately.***
