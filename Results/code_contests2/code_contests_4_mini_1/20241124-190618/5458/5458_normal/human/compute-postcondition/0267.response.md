Postcondition: ***If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, where `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to the `dp` array.***
