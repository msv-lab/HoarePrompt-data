The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement, the output state remains the same. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is `s + 2`, `k` is 1, `i` is an integer and `i` is not equal to 0, and the value of `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is `s + 2`, `k` is 1, `i` is an integer and `i` is not equal to 0, and the value of `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
