Given the initial state where `N`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are between 1 and 7, 1 and 7, 1 and 2000, and 1 and 3000 respectively, we can analyze the provided code.

The statement `print(dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod)` involves several calculations:
- `n ** 2 & 1` calculates the bitwise AND of `n` squared and `1`. Since `n` ranges from 1 to 7, `n ** 2` will be between 1 and 49. The result of this operation will be `0` if `n` is even and `1` if `n` is odd.
- `m + 1` will be between 2 and 2001, depending on the value of `m`.
- `s` is between 1 and 3000.

We do not have the specific values of `dp`, `mod`, or the actual values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, but based on the provided conditions:
- If `n`, `m`, and `s` are valid (which they are, as they are within the specified ranges), and assuming `dp` is properly defined, the output will depend on the values at the specific indices calculated.

Since the output of the statement is contingent on the values in `dp` at the computed indices and the modulo operation, and since we do not have a defined `mod`, we cannot specify the exact output value.

However, since we know that `dp` is being accessed correctly and the modulo operation will yield a valid result, we will summarize the output state based on the initial conditions.

Output State: **`N`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are valid; access `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s]` and print the result modulo `mod`.**
