Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no change to the values of the variables or the `dp` array in this fragment.***
