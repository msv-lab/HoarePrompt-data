The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the fact that we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
