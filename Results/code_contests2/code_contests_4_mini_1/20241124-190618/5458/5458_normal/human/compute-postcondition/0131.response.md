Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is equal to `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made in this fragment, and the program proceeds without executing the if block.**
