Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][3][k]` to 1 if `j` (which is 2) is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is at least `s + 1`, and `s` is at least 2). Since `k` is at least 3, this means `j` must be 2 or greater for the update to occur. `m` remains at least 2, `s` is at least 2, and `i` can vary. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no update to `dp`.***
