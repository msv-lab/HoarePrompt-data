The code snippet assigns values to `n`, `m`, and `s` by mapping the output of `raw_input()` split into integers. The initial state indicates that `N`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are valid, but does not provide specific values for these variables. Thus, after execution, we can only determine that `n`, `m`, and `s` are now assigned new integer values from the input. The states of `N` and the access to `dp[n]` are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is valid, `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned new integer values from input**
