The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the remaining part of the current loop iteration, moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next loop iteration.
