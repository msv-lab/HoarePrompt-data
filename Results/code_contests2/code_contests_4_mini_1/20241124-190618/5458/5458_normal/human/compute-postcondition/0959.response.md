Postcondition: ***`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program does not continue.***
