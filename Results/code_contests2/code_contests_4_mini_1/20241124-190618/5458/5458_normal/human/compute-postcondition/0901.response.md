The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves performing a computation using the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The value of `i` is 0. Therefore, `i + 1` results in 1.
2. The bitwise operation `1 & 1` results in 1, so `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is the index being accessed.
3. The value of `j` is 2, so `j + 1` results in 3.
4. The value of `k` is 1.
5. Given these calculations, the assignment is `dp[1][3][1] = 1`.

The states of `m`, `s`, and the array `dp` are not defined in terms of specific values or structure, but since `dp` is updated accordingly, the output state will include the assignment made.

Output State: **`i` is equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `k` is equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated accordingly, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
