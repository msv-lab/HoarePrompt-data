Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least `s + 1`, `j` is at least `s + 1`, `k` is 3, and `i` is an integer. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
