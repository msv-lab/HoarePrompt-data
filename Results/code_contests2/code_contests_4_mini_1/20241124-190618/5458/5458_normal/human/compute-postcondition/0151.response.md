Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` has been updated based on the conditions provided in the loop, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, resulting in `dp[1][3][1] = 1`. There are no changes made to the program state if `j` is less than `k`, as there is no else part in the code.***
