Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than 1, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.***
