Postcondition: ***`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, specifically `dp[n + 1 & 1][4][3]` is set to 1. Since `j` is fixed at 3 and `k` is also 3, this condition will hold true in this scenario. There is no else part in the code.***
