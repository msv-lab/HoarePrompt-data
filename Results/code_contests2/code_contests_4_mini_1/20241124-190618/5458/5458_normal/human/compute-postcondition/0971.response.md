Output State: **`if n, m, s are positive integers fulfilling their respective constraints then after the loop executes the output of dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod will be printed. The loop continues to execute as long as n, m, s are not all zero, otherwise it terminates. If n, m, s are all zero, the loop will not execute and the program will end without printing anything.`**
