According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop is defined to iterate from `1` to `s`, so for it to execute one more time, `s` must be at least `k + 1`, where `k` is the variable that is incremented in each iteration starting from `2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have `k` as `2`, and since `s` is greater than or equal to `1`, `s` must be adjusted to be at least `3` for the loop to execute once more (the next value of `k` would be `3`). Additionally, `k` should be updated to the next value, which is `3`.

So, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `s` should be greater than or equal to `3` and `k` should be updated to `3`.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and `j` is between 2 and 8.**
