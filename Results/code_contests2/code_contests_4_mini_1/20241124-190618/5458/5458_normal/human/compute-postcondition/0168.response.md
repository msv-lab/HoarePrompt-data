Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is updated by taking the value from `dp[1][2][2]` and adding `dp[0][2][0] % mod`, while ensuring that all other variable relationships and conditions from the precondition are maintained. In case `j` equals `k`, it is important to note that the value of `dp[1][3][2]` will be determined based on the first condition, while in cases where `j` is less than `k`, the second condition applies.***
