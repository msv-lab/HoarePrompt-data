Postcondition: ***`N`, `n`, `m` are integers with values at least 3; `s` is at least 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][2]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp` and the program proceeds accordingly, preserving the values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` as initially specified.***
