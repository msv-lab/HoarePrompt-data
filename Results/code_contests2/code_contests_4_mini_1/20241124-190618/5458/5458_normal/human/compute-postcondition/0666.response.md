Postcondition: ***Given that `N` is valid, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[1][j + 1][k] + dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring all operations respect the bounds of `j` and `k`, and the values in the array are calculated modulo `mod`.***
