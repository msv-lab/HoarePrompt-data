Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` equals `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This logic ensures that all conditions regarding the values of `j` and `k` are handled appropriately, including the case where `j` equals `k` or `j` is less than `k`.***
