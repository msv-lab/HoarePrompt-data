The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the current iteration of a loop to skip the remaining code and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `N`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is `N`, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
