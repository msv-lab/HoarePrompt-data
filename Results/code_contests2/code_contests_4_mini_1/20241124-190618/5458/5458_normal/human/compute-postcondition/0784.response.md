The code assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to index into the `dp` array. Since `i` is `n`, we can infer that the indices will be determined by the values of `n`, `j`, and `s`. The specific values of `j`, `m`, and `k` indicate that `j` is at least `1`, `m` is at least `1`, `s` is at least `1`, and `k` is equal to `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state remains focused on the values of `dp` being updated, but we do not know the specific values in `dp` since they depend on prior computations. So, we note that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] based on the previous value at indices [i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
