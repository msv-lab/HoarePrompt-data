Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` (which is 2) is greater than `k` (where `k` is at least 1). The values of `m` remain at least 2, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 1. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
