According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute for `j` from 1 to `m`, which means that the maximum value for `j` is `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `m` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 4 (the next value). Therefore, the condition for the loop to continue executing is that `m` must be at least 4 (i.e., `m` is greater than or equal to 4).

All other states remain unchanged since they do not affect the loop execution directly. 

State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
