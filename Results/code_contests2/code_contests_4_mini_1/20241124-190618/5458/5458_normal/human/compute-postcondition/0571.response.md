Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In addition, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` after modulo operation. Thus, the state of `dp` reflects updates based on the comparisons of `j` and `k`, handling the cases when `j` is equal to `k` and when `j` is less than `k`.***
