According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop iterates for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Thus, `s` needs to be greater than or equal to 3 to allow one more iteration.

Since `k` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, at the beginning of the next iteration, `k` will be 4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `s` to be greater than or equal to 4.

No other states need to be adjusted as `i`, `j`, and `m` conditions do not affect the loop execution directly.

State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 4, and `s` is greater than or equal to 4**
