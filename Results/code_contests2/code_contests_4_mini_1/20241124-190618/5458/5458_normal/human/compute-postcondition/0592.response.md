The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated based on the relationship between `j` and `k`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
