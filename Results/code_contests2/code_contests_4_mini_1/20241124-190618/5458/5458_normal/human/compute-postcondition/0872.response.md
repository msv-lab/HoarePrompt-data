The statement `continue` causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop in which it resides. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement, but it indicates that we will continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state is: 

`i` is not equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is not equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
