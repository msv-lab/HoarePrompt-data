Postcondition: ***`N`, `n`, `m` are at least 3; `s` is at least 1; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is 3; `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to match the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues. There are no changes to `dp` if `j` is not greater than `k`, although these cases are not explicitly handled in the code.***
