Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the relationships between `j` and `k` for each iteration. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds accordingly, with `i` remaining 1, `m` being greater than or equal to 2, `s` being greater than or equal to 1, and `k` being 1, while ensuring that `i` is not equal to 0.***
