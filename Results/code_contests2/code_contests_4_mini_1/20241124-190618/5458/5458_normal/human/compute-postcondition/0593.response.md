Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the relationship between `j` and `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the loop proceeds without updating `dp`. In any case, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is at least 2.***
