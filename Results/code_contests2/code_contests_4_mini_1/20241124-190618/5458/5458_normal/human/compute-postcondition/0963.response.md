According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. Additionally, `s` must be greater than or equal to 4 to ensure that the loop condition `k <= s` is satisfied.

State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is 4**
