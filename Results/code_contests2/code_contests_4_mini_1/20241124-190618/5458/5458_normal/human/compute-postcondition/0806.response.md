According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop continues as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to 2. Since `s` is at least 1, it still satisfies the condition for the loop to continue.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `k` should be updated to 2.

The values of `m`, `s`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, and `k` is 2.**
