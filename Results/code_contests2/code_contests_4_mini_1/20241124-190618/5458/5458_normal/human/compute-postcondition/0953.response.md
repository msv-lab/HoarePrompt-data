Postcondition: ***`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` and `dp[i & 1][3][k - j]`, ensuring that all operations respect the modulo constraint. The state of `dp` is modified based on the evaluated conditions.***
