Postcondition: ***`N`, `n`, `m` are integers with values at least 3; `s` is at least 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `k` is 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][3][0] % mod`.***
