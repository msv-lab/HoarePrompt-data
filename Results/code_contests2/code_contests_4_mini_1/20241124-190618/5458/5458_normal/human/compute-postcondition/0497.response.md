Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and `j` is between 2 and 8. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the next iteration of the loop is initiated. If `j` is equal to or less than `k`, no action is taken and the program continues without modification to `dp`.***
