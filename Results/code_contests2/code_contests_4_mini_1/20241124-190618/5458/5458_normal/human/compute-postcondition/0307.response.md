Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` equals `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged in that case. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on previous values, specifically `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and also incorporates `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
