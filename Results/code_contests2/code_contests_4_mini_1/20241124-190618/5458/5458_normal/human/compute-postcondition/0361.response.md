Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer greater than `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is `s + 1`). If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, and `i` is 0, the state of `dp` remains unchanged; otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to either the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` or the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures that all possible scenarios concerning the boundaries of `j` and `k` are handled appropriately.***
