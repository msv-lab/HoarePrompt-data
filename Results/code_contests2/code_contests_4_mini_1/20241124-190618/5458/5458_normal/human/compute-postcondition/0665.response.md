The expression updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous state of the affected variables is not specified, but we know that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state captures the update operation but does not provide specific values since they are not defined.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
