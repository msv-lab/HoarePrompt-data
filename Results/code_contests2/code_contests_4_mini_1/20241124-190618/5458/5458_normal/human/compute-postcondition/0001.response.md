The variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the values from the input, which is provided as a space-separated string. The `map` function converts these string values into integers. Since `N`, `M`, and `S` are initially defined as positive integers within specified ranges, the output state will reflect the new values of `n`, `m`, and `s` after the assignment.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values from input.**
