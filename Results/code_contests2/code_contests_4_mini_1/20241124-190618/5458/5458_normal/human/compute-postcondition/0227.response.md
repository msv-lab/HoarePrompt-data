Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0; if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration without further processing. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the variables or the `dp` array.***
