Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration; otherwise, there are no changes made to the variables in the program.***
