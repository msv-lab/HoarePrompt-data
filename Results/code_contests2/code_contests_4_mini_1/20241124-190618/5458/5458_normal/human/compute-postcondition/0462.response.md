The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the remainder of the current iteration in a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that no variables have changed, and we acknowledge that we continue in the current loop.

Output State: **`N` and `n` retain their values between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to `k + 1` and less than or equal to 3001, and `k` is equal to `k + 1`, and we continue in the loop.**
