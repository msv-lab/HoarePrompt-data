Postcondition: ***`N` retains its value between 1 and 7, `n` retains its value between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` retains its value between 1 and 3000, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `k` is 1, thus the program copies the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, and continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
