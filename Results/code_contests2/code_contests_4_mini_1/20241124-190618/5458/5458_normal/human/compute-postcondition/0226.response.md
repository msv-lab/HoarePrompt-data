The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that no variables have changed, but we acknowledge that we are continuing the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
