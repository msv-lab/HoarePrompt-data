Output State: **`N` and `n` retain their values between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` retains its value between 1 and 3000, and `k` will range from 1 to `s`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged for that iteration. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value. The loop will execute a maximum of `s` times, and if `s` is 0 or negative, `dp` will remain unchanged and the loop won't execute.**
