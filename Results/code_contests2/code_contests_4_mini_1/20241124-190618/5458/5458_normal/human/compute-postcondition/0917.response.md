Output State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp` is updated accordingly. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, if j is greater than k. If j is not greater than k, there are no changes made to `dp`, and the next iteration of the loop will proceed with the same values for `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `s`.**
