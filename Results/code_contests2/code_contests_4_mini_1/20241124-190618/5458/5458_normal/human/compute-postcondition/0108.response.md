Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0 or greater, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` will take values from 1 to `s`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it after taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The loop iterates `s` times provided `s` is at least 1; otherwise, no iterations occur, and `dp` remains unchanged.**
