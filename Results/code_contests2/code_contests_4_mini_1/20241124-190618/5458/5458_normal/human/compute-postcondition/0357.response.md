The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer greater than `s`, `dp` is updated at [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is `s + 1; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
