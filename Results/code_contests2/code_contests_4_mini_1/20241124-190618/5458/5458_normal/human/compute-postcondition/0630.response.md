Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][3][k]` to 1 if `j` (which is 2) is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is at least `s + 1`, and `s` is at least 2). If `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is at least 2, the update occurs at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. In the else block, if `j` (2) is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. In all cases, `m` remains at least 2, `s` is at least 2, and `i` can vary.***
