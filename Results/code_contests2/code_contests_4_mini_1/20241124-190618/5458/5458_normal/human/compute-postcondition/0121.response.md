The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the values of `N`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged and the state indicates that we are continuing to the next iteration, the output state reflects the current values of the variables and acknowledges the continuation of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is equal to `n` and is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is now incremented by 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
