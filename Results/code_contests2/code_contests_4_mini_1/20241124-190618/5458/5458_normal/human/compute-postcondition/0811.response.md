Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there are no changes made to the variables or the array.***
