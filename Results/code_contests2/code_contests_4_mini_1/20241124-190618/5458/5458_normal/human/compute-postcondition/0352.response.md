Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, and `dp` is a 2-dimensional list. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged throughout the execution.***
