Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds without executing the if statement.***
