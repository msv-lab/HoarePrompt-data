Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the relationships between `j` and `k`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, where `j` is at least 1 and `k` is at least 2. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp`. Thus, the state of `dp` reflects this relationship accordingly.***
