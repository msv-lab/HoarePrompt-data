To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop's conditions and the information provided about the previous iteration.

1. The loop is structured as `for j in xrange(1, m + 1)`, which means it will iterate over values of `j` starting from 1 up to `m`.
2. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, and it will run for each value of `j` from 1 to `m`.
3. Since we know that at the end of the previous iteration, the loop executed `s` times, we can conclude that `j` must have reached at least `s` during the last iteration.
4. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented. Given that `j` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `m`, if the last iteration had `j` equal to `s`, then for the loop to continue executing, `j` must be set to `s + 1` in the next iteration.
5. Furthermore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least `s + 1`, meaning that `m` must be adjusted to be at least `s + 1`.

Based on these considerations, the adjusted states are:

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 1`, `j` is `s + 1`**
