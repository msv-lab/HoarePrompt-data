Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the relationship between `j` and `k`, where `j` is 2 and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, specifically in this case where `j` is 2 and `k` is 1, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp` at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged, as it takes the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp` at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. Throughout this process, `m` remains at least 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` can vary, affecting the computation of `dp` based on the value of `j` relative to `k`.***
