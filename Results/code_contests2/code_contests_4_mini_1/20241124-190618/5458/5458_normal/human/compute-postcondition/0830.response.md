The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the `dp` structure. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`. The value of `j + 1` is `4` since `j` is `3`. The value of `k` is `1`. Therefore, the code sets the value of `dp[1][4][1]` to `1`. 

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is: `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `i` is 0, `dp` is modified with `dp[1][4][1] = 1`, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `i` is 0, `dp` is modified with `dp[1][4][1] = 1`, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
