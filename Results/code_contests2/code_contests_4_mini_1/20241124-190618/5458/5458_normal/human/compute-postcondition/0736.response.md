The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index in a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The affected variables are `i`, `j`, and `k`. The values for `k` is `2`, and both `j` and `k` are at least `s + 2`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either `0` or `1` based on the parity of `i`. Since `s` is at least `1`, `j + 1` is at least `s + 3`. 

The output state does not change the existing values of `s`, `m`, `j`, `k`, or `i`, but indicates that an assignment has taken place in the `dp` array. Thus, the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is at least `s + 2`, `k` is 2, `i` is an integer, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is at least `s + 2`, `k` is 2, `i` is an integer, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
