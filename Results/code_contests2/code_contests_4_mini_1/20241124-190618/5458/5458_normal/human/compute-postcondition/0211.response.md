Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[0][3][3]` modulo `mod` and adding the value of `dp[0][3][0]` modulo `mod`. In all cases, the values of `dp` at indices influenced by the conditions reflect the operations performed based on the relationships between `j` and `k`.***
