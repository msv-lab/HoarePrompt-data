The statement `continue` indicates that the program will skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are being modified or returned, we only note that the loop continues without any changes to the current state of the variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated based on the relationships between `j` and `k`, `m` is at least 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
