According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Therefore, `k` must be adjusted to be 3, and `s` must remain at least 3 (to ensure that the loop can execute with `k` at 3). 

State: **`j` is less than `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3**
