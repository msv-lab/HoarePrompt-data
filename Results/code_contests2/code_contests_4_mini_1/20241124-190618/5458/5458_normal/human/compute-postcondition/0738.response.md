The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns a value from the `dp` array based on the indices calculated from the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

- The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes the bitwise AND of `i + 1` and `1`, which results in either `0` or `1`. This means it toggles between two states based on whether `i + 1` is even or odd.
- The index `j + 1` simply increments `j` by `1`.
- The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, meaning it copies the value from one position in the `dp` array to another. 

None of the initial state variables (`s`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `i`) are modified directly by this assignment; rather, the assignment affects the `dp` array based on the computed indices.

Since we do not have specific values for `i`, `j`, or the contents of `dp`, we cannot determine the specific values in the `dp` array after this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of the initial variables along with the nature of the assignment.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is at least `s + 2`, `k` is 2, `i` is an integer, and the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
