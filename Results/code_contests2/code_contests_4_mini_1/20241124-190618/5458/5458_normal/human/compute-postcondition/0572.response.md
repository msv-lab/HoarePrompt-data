According to the code, the loop iterates over variable `k`, and it will execute if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `k` should be 4. Additionally, `s` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 4 to ensure the loop can continue. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is 4**
