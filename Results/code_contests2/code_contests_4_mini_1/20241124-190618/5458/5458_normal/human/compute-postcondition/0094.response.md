Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0 or greater, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no change to the `dp` array or operation performed in this block, and the state remains unchanged with respect to the `dp` array.***
