Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000, and `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `n`, `m`, or `s` is not equal to 0, the program continues execution beyond this block.***
