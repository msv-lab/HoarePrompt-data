According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased to the next value, which would be 4. Additionally, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 4 for the loop to execute again, as the loop condition is `k in range(1, s + 1)`. Given that `s` is greater than or equal to 3, this means that `s` must be at least 4 for `k` to be valid in the next iteration.

State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is 4**
