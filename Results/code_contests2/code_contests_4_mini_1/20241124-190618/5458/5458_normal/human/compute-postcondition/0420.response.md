Postcondition: ***`N`, `n`, `m` are integers with values at least 3; `s` is at least 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to the value of `dp[1][3][2]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][4][2]` is computed as the sum of `dp[1][3][2]` and `dp[0][3][0]` modulo `mod`, where `k` must also account for the values of `j`, ensuring the program handles all cases related to the relationships between `j` and `k`.***
