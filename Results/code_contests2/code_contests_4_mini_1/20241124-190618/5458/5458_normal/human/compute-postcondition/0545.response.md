Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, reflecting that the condition for updating the `dp` array was satisfied. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, but the other variable conditions remain unchanged.***
