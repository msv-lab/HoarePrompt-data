The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index of a multi-dimensional list `dp`. 

First, we need to calculate the indices:
- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which equals `1`.
- `j + 1` is `2 + 1`, which equals `3`.
- `k` retains its value of `2`.

Thus, the assignment modifies `dp[1][3][2]` to `1`. 

The values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are unchanged by this operation, and the assignment does not affect any other variables.

Therefore, the output state is:
`N` retains its value, `n` retains its value, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` retains its value, `n` retains its value, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1**
