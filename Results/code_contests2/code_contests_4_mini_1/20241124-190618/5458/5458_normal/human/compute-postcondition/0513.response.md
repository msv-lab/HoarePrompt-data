Postcondition: ***`j` is less than `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop without modifying any values. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there are no changes to any variables or states.***
