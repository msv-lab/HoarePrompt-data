Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is equal to `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][3]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp` and the execution proceeds without modification.***
