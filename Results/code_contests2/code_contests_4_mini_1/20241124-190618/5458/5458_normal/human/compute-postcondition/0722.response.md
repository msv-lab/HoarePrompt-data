To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we must analyze the provided conditions and the loop structure.

1. The loop iterates `k` from `1` to `s`, inclusive. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least `1`. This condition is already satisfied as stated (`s` at least `1`).

2. The loop will execute a total of `s` times, which aligns with the condition that `k` can take values between `1` and `s`. 

3. The variable `j` is set to `s + 2`, but its relevance depends on how it is used within the loop body, which is omitted. However, we know from the state description that `m` is at least `s + 2`, which is consistent with the value of `j`.

4. The variable `i` is stated to be an integer that will remain unchanged throughout the loop. Its initial value is not specified, but it does not affect the loop's execution directly. 

Given these points, the state includes:
- `s` is at least `1` (ensured).
- `m` is at least `s + 2` (ensured).
- `j` is `s + 2`.
- `k` will take values from `1` to `s`, starting at `1` in the first iteration.

To summarize, before the loop starts, the state should reflect the initialized conditions.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is `s + 2`, `k` is 1, `i` is an integer**
