Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the values remain unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and also includes the contribution from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. In all cases, the values of `N`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
