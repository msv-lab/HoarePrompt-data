Postcondition: ***`N` and `n` retain their values between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to `k + 1` and less than or equal to 3001, `k` is equal to `k + 1`, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. There is no change to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` if `j` is less than `k`.***
