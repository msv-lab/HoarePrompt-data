Output State: **`m`, `s`, `j` are at least 3; `i` is equal to `n`; `k` is 3; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped; if `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp` and the loop continues normally.**
