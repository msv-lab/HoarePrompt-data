Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and `j` is between 2 and 8. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` remains unchanged.***
