According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented, meaning `j` should be equal to 2 at the start of the next iteration. Additionally, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 to ensure that the loop can execute again.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect this:

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is equal to `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `s` is equal to the original value of `s`, and `dp` has been updated based on the conditions provided in the loop.**
