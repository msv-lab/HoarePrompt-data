According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the variable `s`. The loop iterates through the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `s` is at least 1, it allows for `k` to take the value of 2.

State: **`m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n`, and `k` is 2.**
