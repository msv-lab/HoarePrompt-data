According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop `for j in xrange(1, m + 1):` will execute if `m` is at least 1, since `j` will take on values from 1 to `m`. The initial state indicates that `i` is `n`, but it does not relate to the execution of the loop. For the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and that `j` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop. 

State: **`i` is n, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
