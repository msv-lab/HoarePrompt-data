The code executes a `continue` statement, which causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. As a result, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` remains unchanged, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than 1, `i` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` remains unchanged, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than 1, `i` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
