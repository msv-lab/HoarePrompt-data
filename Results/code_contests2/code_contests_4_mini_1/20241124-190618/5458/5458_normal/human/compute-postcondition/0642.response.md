According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 3 (so that `j` can be 2 in the next iteration) and `j` will be updated to 3.

Thus, we need to ensure `m` is at least 3 to allow the loop to run again, and set `j` to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`dp` is updated based on the values of `j` and `k`, `j` is 3, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, and `m` is at least 3**
