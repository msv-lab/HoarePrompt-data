Postcondition: ***`j` is less than `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, maintaining the values in the `dp` array for the indices affected by this condition. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program will not execute the body of the if statement, thus not altering the state of `dp` or the iteration.***
