Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, this condition does not apply.***
