According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop is set to iterate over the range from `0` to `n ** 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` remains `n`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. Since `i` is currently `n`, we need to adjust it to `n + 1`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `m` and `s` are stated to be at least 1, ensuring the conditions for the loop to execute again are satisfied.

State: **`i` is n + 1**
