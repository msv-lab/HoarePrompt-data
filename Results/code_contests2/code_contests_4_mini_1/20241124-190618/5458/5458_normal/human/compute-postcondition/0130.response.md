The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is equal to `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
