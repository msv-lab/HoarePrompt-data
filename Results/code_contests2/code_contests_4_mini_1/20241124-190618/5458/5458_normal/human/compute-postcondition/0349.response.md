Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, and `dp` is a 2-dimensional list. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the loop continues.***
