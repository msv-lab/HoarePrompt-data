According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the range specified by `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n ** 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, since the outer loop will execute `m` times and `s` is at least 1, it indicates that the conditions for the loop execution are met. The variable `i` needs to be incremented for the loop to run again.

If the outer loop has reached its last value, `i` should be adjusted to be equal to `n ** 2`. Therefore, to allow for one more execution of the loop, `i` must be set to `n ** 2`.

State: **`dp` remains unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `s` is at least 1, `j` is unchanged, `i` is `n ** 2`**
