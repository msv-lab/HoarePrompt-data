The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop it is in. Since there are no changes to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` has been updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`**
