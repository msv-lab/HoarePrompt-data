Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, while the values of `N`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `j` is less than `k`, the values remain as they were, and the assignment does not occur.***
