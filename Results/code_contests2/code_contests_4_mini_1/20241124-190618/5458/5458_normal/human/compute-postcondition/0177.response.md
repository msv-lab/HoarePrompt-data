Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[1][3][3]` is updated based on the value of `dp[0][2][3]` and `dp[0][2][1] % mod`, while also ensuring that it incorporates the modulo operation to handle potential overflow cases. In either case, the state of the `dp` array is modified accordingly based on the value of `j` relative to `k`.***
