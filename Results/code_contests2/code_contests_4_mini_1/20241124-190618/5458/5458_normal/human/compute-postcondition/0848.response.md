Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n`, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, thus covering all edge cases related to the values of `j` and the state of the `dp` array.***
