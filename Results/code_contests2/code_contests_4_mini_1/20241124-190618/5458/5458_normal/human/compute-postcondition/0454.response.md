Postcondition: ***`N` and `n` retain their values between 1 and 7; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3001; `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the current loop iteration is skipped, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
