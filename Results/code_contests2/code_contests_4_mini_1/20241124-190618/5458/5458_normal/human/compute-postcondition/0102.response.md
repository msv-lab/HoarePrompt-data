The values of the variables do not change, but we continue the loop or the execution of the block of code that we are currently in. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0 or greater, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and the dp array is updated at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue the execution.
