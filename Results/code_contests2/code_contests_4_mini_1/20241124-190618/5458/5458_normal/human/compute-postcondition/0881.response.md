The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is in and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop continues without altering the values of the variables.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and the loop continues.**
