The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and move to the next iteration. However, it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same, indicating that the loop continues without altering the existing variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and the operation on `dp` is performed, and we continue to the next iteration.**
