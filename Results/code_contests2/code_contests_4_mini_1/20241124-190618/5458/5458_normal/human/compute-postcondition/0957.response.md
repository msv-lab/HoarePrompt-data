The assignment modifies the value at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to the value at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `i` remains as `n`, `j` is 3, and `k` is 3. The operation does not change any of the values of `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, or `k` directly; it only affects the contents of the `dp` array at the specified indices. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables involved.

Output State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3**
