The statement `continue` does not change the values of the variables but causes the program to skip the remainder of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variable values.

Output State: **`m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 2, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
