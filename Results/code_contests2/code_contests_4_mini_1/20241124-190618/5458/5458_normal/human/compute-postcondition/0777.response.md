Postcondition: ***`dp` remains unchanged at all indices except at `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. In all cases, the preconditions regarding the values of `dp`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` are maintained, ensuring that `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, and `k` is `s + 1`.***
