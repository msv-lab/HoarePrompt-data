Postcondition: ***`N` and `n` retain their values between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to `k + 1` and less than or equal to 3001, and `k` is equal to `k + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1; otherwise, if `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is first set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures that all scenarios regarding the comparisons of `j` against `k` are covered while updating the appropriate indices of `dp` accordingly.***
