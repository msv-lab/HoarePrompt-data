Postcondition: ***`N` retains its value, `n` retains its value, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][2][2]`, and the program continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
