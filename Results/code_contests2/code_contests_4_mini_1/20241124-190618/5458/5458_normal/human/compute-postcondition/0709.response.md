Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `m` is at least `s + 1`, `j` is at least `s + 1`, `k` is 2, and `i` is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` added to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All updates to `dp` maintain the variable constraints and appropriately reflect the relationships among `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
