The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` represents an assignment to a 3-dimensional array (or list) called `dp`. 

1. The value of `i` is currently 0. Therefore, `i + 1` equals 1, and the expression `1 & 1` evaluates to 1 (since bitwise AND of 1 and 1 is 1).
2. The value of `j` is currently 3. Therefore, `j + 1` equals 4.
3. The value of `k` is currently 1.

Thus, the assignment translates to `dp[1][4][1] = 1`. The states of other variables (`N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`) do not change as a result of this operation.

Output State: **`N`, `n`, `m` are integers with values at least 3; `s` is an integer with a value of at least 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `k` is 1; and `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1**
