The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates that we are assigning the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

In this context:
- `i` is an integer and not equal to 0.
- `j` is at least `s + 2`, which is greater than `k` (since `k` is 1).
- `j + 1` will be at least `s + 3`.
- The expression `i + 1 & 1` results in either `0` or `1`, depending on whether `i` is even or odd.

The values of `dp` are being modified, but we cannot determine the exact values since the initial state of `dp` is not provided. However, we know that the operation does not change the values of `s`, `m`, `j`, `k`, or `i`. 

Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding the known variables.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is `s + 2`, `k` is 1, `i` is an integer and `i` is not equal to 0, and the value of `j` is greater than `k`.**
