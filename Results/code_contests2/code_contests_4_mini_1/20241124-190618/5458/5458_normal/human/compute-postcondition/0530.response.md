The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables directly, but it affects the flow of execution in a loop by skipping the remaining code in the current iteration and moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variables' values.

Output State: **`j` is less than `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
