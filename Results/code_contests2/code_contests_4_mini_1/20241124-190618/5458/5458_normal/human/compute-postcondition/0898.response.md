According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `s + 1`. 

The current state indicates that `k` is ranging from 1 to `s`, and since `k` starts at 1, it is already positioned correctly for the first iteration as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is currently 1 (as it is the starting value). The values of `i`, `m`, `j`, and `dp` do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated accordingly**
