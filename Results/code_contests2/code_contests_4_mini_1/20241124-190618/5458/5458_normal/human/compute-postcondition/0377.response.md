Postcondition: ***`N` retains its value, `n` retains its value, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. All other variable values remain unchanged.***
