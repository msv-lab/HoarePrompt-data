Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least `s + 1`, `j` is at least `s + 1`, `k` is 3, and `i` is an integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` array or the loop state. Thus, the program maintains the integrity of the input conditions while potentially modifying the `dp` array based on the value of `j`.***
