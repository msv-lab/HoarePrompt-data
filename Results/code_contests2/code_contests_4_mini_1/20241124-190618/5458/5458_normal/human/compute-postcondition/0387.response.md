According to the code, the loop is governed by the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 2. Since `s` retains its value and is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Additionally, `s` must be at least 3 to allow for this increment.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `k` should be updated to 3, and `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N`, `n`, `m`, `s` retain their values, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 2, and `k` is equal to 3**
