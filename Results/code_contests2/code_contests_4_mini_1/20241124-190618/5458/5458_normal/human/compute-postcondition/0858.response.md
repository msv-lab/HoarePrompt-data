To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop structure.

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - The state indicates that `m`, `s`, and `j` are at least 3.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `k` is 3.
   - The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s + 1` (inclusive of 1 and exclusive of `s + 1`).

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s + 1`. 
   - Currently, `k` is 3. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3 (since `k` needs to go to `s` at its maximum). If `s` is exactly 3, the loop will execute one more time with `k` becoming 4, which would not be valid as it exceeds the limit. Therefore, `s` must be greater than 3 to allow for the next iteration of the loop with valid `k`.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `k` is currently 3, we need to ensure that `s` is greater than 3 for the loop to continue. Additionally, since `k` is incremented in the loop, we need to adjust `k` to be equal to 4 for the next iteration. 

Thus, the adjustments needed are to ensure that `s` is greater than 3 and to set `k` to 4.

State: **`m` is at least 3, `s` is greater than 3, `j` is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n`, and `k` is 4**
