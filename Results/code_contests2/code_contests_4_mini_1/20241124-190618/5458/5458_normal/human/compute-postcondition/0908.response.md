The statement updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp` are not provided, but we know that `i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than 2, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is accessed and its result is then taken modulo `mod`. This updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, but does not affect the values of `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, or `s`.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of the variables and the updated state of the `dp` array.

Output State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than 2, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
