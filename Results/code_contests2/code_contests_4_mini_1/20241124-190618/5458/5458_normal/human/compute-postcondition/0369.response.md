Postcondition: ***`N` retains its value, `n` retains its value, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1. There is no change to `dp[1][3][1]` if `j` is less than `k`, and all other variable values remain unchanged.***
