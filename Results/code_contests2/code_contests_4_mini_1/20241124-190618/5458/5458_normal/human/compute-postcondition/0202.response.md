Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is equal to `dp[1][3][2]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is updated based on the modulus of `dp[1][3][2]` and includes an addition from `dp[0][3][0]`, ensuring that all cases are handled appropriately.***
