The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop it is in and moves to the next iteration, if applicable. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` equals `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
