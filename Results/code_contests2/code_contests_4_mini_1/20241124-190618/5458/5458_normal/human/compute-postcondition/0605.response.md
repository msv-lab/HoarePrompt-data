Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the value of `i`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value. If `k` is less than 1 or greater than `s`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. In all cases, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, inclusive.***
