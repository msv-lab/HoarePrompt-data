The command `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 2, `k` is at least 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `k` is at least 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
