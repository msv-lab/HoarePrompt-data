According to the code provided, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n ** 2`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is currently at its maximum value for this loop (which is `n ** 2 - 1`), then to execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n ** 2`. However, since `i` needs to be less than `n ** 2` for the loop to continue executing, the state of `i` must also be adjusted accordingly. 

If `i` is currently 0 (the starting point of the loop), it will increment up to `n ** 2 - 1`. After the last iteration, `i` would be `n ** 2 - 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be adjusted to `n ** 2`, which would mean the loop can no longer execute.

Thus, since the conditions around `n`, `m`, and `s` have not been specified and are not changing the loop execution, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`.

State: **`i` is n ** 2**
