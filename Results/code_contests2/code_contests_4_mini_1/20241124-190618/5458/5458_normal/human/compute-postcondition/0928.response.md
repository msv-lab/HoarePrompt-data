Postcondition: ***`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]` is updated based on the values of `dp` without changing the values of `i`, `j`, or `k`. Thus, the state of the `dp` array is modified according to the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
