Postcondition: ***`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration without changing the state of the variables. There are no changes made to the variables or the array `dp` in this case, and if `j` is not greater than `k`, the code does not execute as there is no else part.***
