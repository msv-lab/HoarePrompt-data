The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables but rather instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that there is no change in the values of the variables. 

Output State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated accordingly, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
