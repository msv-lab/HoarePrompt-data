According to the code, since the loop is a `while 1` loop, it is designed to execute indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time, as it will continue to do so without any conditions.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` equals `N`, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, and `dp[n`**
