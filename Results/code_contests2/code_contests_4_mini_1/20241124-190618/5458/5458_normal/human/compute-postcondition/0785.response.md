The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue to the next iteration. The values of the variables `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not changed by this statement, but it affects the flow of control in the program by moving to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration without modifying the variable states.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] based on the previous value at indices [i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
