Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the relationships between `j` and `k`. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, leaving `dp` unchanged in terms of the impact of `j` and `k`. In the case where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The state of `dp` thus reflects all conditions and relationships among `i`, `j`, and `k` accordingly, ensuring no edge cases are left unaddressed.***
