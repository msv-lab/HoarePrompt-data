Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer greater than `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is `s + 1`); if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
