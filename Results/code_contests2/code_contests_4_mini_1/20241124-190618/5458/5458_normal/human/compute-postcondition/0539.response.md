According to the code, the outer loop will execute for each `i` from 0 to `n^2 - 1`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` can take on the next value, which is `i + 1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, if `i` is equal to 0 or 1, the loop can execute again for the next value of `i`. If `i` is currently at `n^2 - 1`, the loop cannot execute again since it has reached its upper limit. 

Since the task states that `s` is at least 1 and the behavior of the loop is structured for `i` being 0 or 1, we can conclude that, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to `1` if it was `0`, or incremented if it was `1`. 

No other variables are affected by the outer loop's execution, so we only need to adjust `i` accordingly.

State: **`i` is 1**
