The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, while the values of the variables are not modified, it implies that we are skipping the rest of the code within the loop for the current iteration. Thus, the values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to the variable values.

Output State: **`N` retains its value between 1 and 7, `n` retains its value between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` retains its value between 1 and 3000, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
