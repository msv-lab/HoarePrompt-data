The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
