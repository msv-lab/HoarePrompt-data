The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables do not change, but we will skip the rest of the current loop iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and indicates that we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `j` is between 2 and 8, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
