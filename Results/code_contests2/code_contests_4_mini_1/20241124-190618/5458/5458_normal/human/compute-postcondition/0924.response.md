The `continue` statement is executed, which skips the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop. The values of the variables `i`, `m`, `j`, and `k` do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state is: `i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
