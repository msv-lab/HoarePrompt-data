Postcondition: ***`m`, `s`, and `j` are at least 3, `i` is equal to `n`, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, ensuring that the update respects the conditions of the variables involved.***
