Postcondition: ***Given that `N` is valid, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 2, and `k` is 3, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][j][k]` modulo `mod` plus `dp[0][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, ensuring that all values remain consistent with the initial preconditions.***
