According to the code, the loop will execute for `j` in the range from 1 to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1, and since `m` is at least 1, we need to adjust `j` to be 2 for the loop to execute again. The value of `m` remains unchanged.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`**
