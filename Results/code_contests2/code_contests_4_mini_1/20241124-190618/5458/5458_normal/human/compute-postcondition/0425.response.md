The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp[1][4][k]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N`, `n`, `m` are integers with values at least 3; `s` is at least 3; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `k` is 3; `dp[1][4][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
