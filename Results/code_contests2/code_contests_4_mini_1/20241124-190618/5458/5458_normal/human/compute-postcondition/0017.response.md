Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is `N`, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program continues with the current iteration.***
