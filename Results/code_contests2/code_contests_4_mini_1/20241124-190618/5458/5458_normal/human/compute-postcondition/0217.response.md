According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1, which is already satisfied since `m` is at least 1. The variable `j` will start at 1 and increment until it reaches `m`. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the states do not need to be adjusted beyond what is already provided. The initial condition for `j` is correctly set to 1, and since `m` is at least 1, the loop will start executing with `j` as 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` remains the original value of `s`**
