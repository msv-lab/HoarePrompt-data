The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. However, since no specific loop context or variables are defined, we can only state that the execution continues without affecting any variable's value. Therefore, the output state preserves the existing values of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
