Postcondition: ***`dp` remains unchanged, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, if `j` is greater than 1, then `j` remains unchanged and we continue to the next iteration of the loop with `i` greater than 0 and `k` equal to 1. If `j` is less than or equal to 1, the program does not modify `dp` and continues without any updates to the variables.***
