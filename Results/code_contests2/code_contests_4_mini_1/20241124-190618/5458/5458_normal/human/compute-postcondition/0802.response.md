Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `i` is greater than 0, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp` and the loop continues.***
