Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is at least `s + 2`, `k` is 2, and `i` is an integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration; otherwise, no changes occur within the program fragment.***
