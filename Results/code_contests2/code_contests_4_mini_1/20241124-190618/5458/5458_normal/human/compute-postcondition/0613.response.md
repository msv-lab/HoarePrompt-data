Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the conditions where `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Specifically, if `j` (which is 2) is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. Additionally, `m` remains at least 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is equal to 0. There is no change to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`, as there is no else part in the code.***
