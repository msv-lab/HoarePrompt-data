The code snippet contains the `continue` statement, which causes the current iteration of a loop to terminate, and the next iteration to begin. However, the values of the variables are not directly modified by this line. The output state will reflect that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop without changing any values.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `i` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
