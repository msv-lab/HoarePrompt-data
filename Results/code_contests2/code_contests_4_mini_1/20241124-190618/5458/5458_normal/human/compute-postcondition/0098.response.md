To determine the modified states at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement carefully.

1. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s + 1`. This means the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is equal to 2. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 2 (as specified), the loop can still execute as long as `k` does not exceed `s`.
3. Since the current value of `k` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted to allow the loop to execute one more time is the value of `k`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0 or greater, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is 3.**
