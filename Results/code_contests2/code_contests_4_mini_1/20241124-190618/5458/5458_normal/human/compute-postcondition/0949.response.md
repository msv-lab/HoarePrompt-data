The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead moves to the next iteration of the loop or the next step in the program flow without executing any subsequent code within the current iteration. Given the initial state, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration without changing the state.**
