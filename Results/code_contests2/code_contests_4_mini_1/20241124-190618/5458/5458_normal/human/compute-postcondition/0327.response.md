Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, and `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the execution continues without any changes to the variables.***
