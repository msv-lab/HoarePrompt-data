Output State: **For `s` at least 1, `m` at least `s + 1`, and `j` at least `s + 1`, after the loop executes `k` times (where `k` is between 1 and `s`), `i` is an integer and will remain unchanged throughout the loop. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 on the first iteration where this condition holds. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to include contributions from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The loop will not execute if `s` is less than 1, in which case `k` would not be defined, and `m`, `j`, and `s` would remain unchanged. Thus, if `s` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and the values remain as initially defined.**
