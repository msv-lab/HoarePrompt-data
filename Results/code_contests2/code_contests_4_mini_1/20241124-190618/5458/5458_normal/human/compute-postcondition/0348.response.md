The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, the values of the variables `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp[1][2][2]`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged as the `continue` statement does not modify any variable values. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `dp[1][2][2]` is updated to `dp[1][1][2]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
