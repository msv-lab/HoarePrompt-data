Postcondition: ***`j` is less than `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without modifying the state of `dp`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the condition does not trigger, and the subsequent iteration logic will proceed, potentially affecting `dp`.***
