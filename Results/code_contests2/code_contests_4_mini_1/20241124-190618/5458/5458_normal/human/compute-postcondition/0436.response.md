According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `s` must be at least 1. Given that `s` retains its value between 1 and 3000, it meets the requirement for the loop to execute since `s` is greater than or equal to 1.

The loop variable `k` will start at 1, and based on the loop structure, it will increment until it reaches `s`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state would include confirming that `s` is within its defined range, `k` starts at 1, and the initial values of `i` and `j` are not relevant to the execution of this loop.

State: **`N` retains its value between 1 and 7, `n` retains its value between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` retains its value between 1 and 3000, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
