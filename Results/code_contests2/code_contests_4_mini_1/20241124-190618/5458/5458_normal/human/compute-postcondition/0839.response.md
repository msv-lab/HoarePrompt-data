Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n`, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, modulo some constant, while `dp` remains otherwise unmodified in all cases. Edge cases involving index bounds and the values of `j` and `k` are handled appropriately.***
