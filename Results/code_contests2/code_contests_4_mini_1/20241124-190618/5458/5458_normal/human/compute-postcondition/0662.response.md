The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the loop will continue executing from the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are still within the loop and has not affected any variable values.

Output State: **`N` is valid, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
