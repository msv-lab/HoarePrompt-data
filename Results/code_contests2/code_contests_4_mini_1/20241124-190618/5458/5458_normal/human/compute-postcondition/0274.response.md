According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3, and we need to ensure that `s` is at least 3 so that the condition for the loop holds true.

Therefore, the other states (`N`, `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j`) do not need to be modified as they do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3**
