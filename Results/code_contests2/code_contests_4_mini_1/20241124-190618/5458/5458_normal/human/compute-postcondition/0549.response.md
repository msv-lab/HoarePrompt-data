The code contains a `continue` statement, which does not alter the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Since the values of `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, and we are in the context of a loop, the output state reflects the unchanged values. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
