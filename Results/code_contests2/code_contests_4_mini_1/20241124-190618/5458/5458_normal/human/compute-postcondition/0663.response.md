Postcondition: ***`N` is valid, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration; if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not change the state of `dp` for those indices.***
