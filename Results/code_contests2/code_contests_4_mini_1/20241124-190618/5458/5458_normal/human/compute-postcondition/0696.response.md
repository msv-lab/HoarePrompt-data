The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the values of `s`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `i`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 1`, `j` is `s + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
