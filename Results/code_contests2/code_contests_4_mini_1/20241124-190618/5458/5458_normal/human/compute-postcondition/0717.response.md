The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is at least 3
- `m` is at least `s + 1`
- `j` is at least `s + 1`
- `k` is 3
- `i` is an integer
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`

We need to check the effect of the new line of code. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be incremented. 

The previous state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is not specified, but it will now be increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 

Thus, the output state describes the change in the `dp` array without being specific about the exact values, as they are not provided.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least `s + 1`, `j` is at least `s + 1`, `k` is 3, `i` is an integer, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
