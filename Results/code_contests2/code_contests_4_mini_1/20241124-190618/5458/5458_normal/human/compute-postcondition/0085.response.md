Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute any other actions within this fragment. The boundaries are handled: `j` will always be greater than `k` since `m` is at least 2, making `j` at least 3 when `k` is 1. Thus, the postcondition primarily reflects the case where the loop continues.***
