Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer greater than `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the 2-dimensional list `dp` is updated such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the loop will proceed without any updates.***
