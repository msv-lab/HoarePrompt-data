Postcondition: ***`N`, `n`, `m` are integers with values at least 3; `s` is an integer with a value of at least 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `k` is 1; and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. There is no change to the values of the variables if `j` is less than `k`, as there is no else part in the code.***
