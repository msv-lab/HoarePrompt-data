According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4, and `s` must be at least 4 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` equals `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 4**
