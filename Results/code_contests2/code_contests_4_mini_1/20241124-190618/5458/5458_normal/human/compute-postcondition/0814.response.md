Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]` and `dp[i & 1][2][0]`, while the states of the variables `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. All modifications to the `dp` array are performed modulo `mod`, ensuring the calculations handle boundary values correctly.***
