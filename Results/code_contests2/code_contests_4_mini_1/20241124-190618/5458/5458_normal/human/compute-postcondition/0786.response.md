Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the value of `i`, `i` is `n`, `j` is at least `1`, `m` is at least `1`, `s` is at least `1`, and `k` is equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp` in this iteration of the loop.***
