The code executes a `continue` statement, which does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the values of the affected variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N`, `n`, `m` are integers with values at least 3; `s` is at least 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `k` is 2; `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][2]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
