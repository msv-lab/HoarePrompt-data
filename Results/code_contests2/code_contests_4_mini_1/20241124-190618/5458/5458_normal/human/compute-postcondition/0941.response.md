Postcondition: ***`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the next iteration of the loop continues. There are no changes to the state if `j` is not greater than `k`, as there is no else part in the code.***
