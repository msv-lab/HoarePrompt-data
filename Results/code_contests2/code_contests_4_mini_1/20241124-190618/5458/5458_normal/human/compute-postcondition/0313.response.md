Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` equals `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without making any changes to the variables. Otherwise, there are no changes made as there is no else part in the code.***
