Postcondition: ***`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[n + 1 & 1][4][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` remains unchanged, reflecting the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is updated to be `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][k]` modulo `mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is further incremented by `dp[i & 1][3][k - j]` modulo `mod`. All conditions preserve the values of `m`, `s`, and the relationships among `j`, `k`, and the `dp` matrix based on the specified conditions.***
