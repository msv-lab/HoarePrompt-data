Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 2; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`; otherwise, the current state of the variables remains unchanged.**
