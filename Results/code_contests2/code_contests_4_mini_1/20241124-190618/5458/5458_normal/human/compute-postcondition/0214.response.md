According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m` and the current value of `j`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `m + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have the following states:
- `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7,
- `n` is equal to `N`,
- `i` is 0,
- `m` is greater than or equal to 3,
- `j` is 3, 
- `s` is greater than or equal to 1,
- `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`.

Since `j` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 4. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 4.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `j` should be updated to 4,
- `m` must be adjusted to be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the updated state should be:
State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`.**
