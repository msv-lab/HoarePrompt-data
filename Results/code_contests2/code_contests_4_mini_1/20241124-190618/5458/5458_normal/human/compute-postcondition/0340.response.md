Postcondition: ***`N`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers where `N` and `n` are between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, and `s` is between 1 and 3000. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged and the execution proceeds beyond the if statement. Thus, the potential values of `j` and `k` must be considered, ensuring that all cases where `j` equals or is less than `k` are accounted for while `j` is strictly greater than `k` in the context of the if condition.***
