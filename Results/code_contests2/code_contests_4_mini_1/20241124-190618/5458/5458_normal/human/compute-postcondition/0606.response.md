According to the code, the loop is dependent on the variable `k`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute again. The loop will increment `k` by 1 on each iteration.

Since `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, and we need to find the state for the next iteration, we need to set `k` to the next value, which would be `k + 1`. 

Therefore, if `k` was `s` at the end of the last iteration, the loop will not execute again. If `k` was less than `s`, we simply increment `k` for the next iteration.

We do not have values for `i`, `j`, or `dp`, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`dp` is updated based on the value of `i`, `j` is unchanged, `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to s, `k` is now 2 (assuming it was 1 in the previous iteration) or `k` is now s + 1 if it was s.**
