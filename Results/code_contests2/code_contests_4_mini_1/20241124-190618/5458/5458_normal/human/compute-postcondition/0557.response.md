The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns a value to a specific index in a 3D array `dp`. 

Let's analyze the components:
- `i` is 1, so `i + 1` results in 2. 
- The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `2 & 1`, which is 0 (since 2 in binary is `10` and 1 is `01`, their bitwise AND is `00`).
- `j` is greater than or equal to 1, so `j + 1` will be at least 2.
- `k` is 2.

Thus, the left-hand side of the assignment becomes:
`dp[0][j + 1][2]`.

For the right-hand side:
- The same calculation for `i` and `k` applies, resulting in `dp[0][j][2]`.

The assignment effectively sets `dp[0][j + 1][2]` to the value of `dp[0][j][2]`. The state of `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[0][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][2]**.
