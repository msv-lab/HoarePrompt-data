Postcondition: ***`dp` remains unchanged except at index `[1][j + 1][k]`, which is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k` as `i` is `n`. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged. In all cases, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, and `k` is `s + 1`.***
