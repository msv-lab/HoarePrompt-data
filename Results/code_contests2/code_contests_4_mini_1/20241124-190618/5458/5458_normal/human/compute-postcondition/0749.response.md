Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is at least `s + 2`, `k` is 3, and `i` is an integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds without any updates.***
