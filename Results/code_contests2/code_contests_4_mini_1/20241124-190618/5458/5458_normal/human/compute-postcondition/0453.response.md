The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest loop. Therefore, the output state is: `N` and `n` retain their values between 1 and 7; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3001; `k` is less than or equal to `s`; and the current loop iteration is skipped.
