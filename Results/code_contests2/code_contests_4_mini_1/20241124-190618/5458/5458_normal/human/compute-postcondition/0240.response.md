According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` (the loop variable) is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to 3, and `s` should still be at least 3 to allow for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
