Postcondition: ***`N`, `n`, `m` are integers with values at least 3; `s` is at least 3; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is updated to `dp[1][3][3]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is updated to the sum of `dp[1][3][3]` modulo `mod` and `dp[0][3][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This accounts for all possible relationships between `j` and `k` in both the if and else statements.***
