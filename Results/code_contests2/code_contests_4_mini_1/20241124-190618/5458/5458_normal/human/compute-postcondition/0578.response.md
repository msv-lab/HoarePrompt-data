The given code updates a specific element in the `dp` array based on the current indices `i`, `j`, and `k`. Here, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. The operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` calculates the indices as follows:

1. `i + 1 & 1` calculates `(0 + 1) & 1`, which results in `1 & 1 = 1`.
2. `j + 1` is `1 + 1 = 2`.
3. `k` remains `1`.

Thus, the statement effectively updates `dp[1][2][1]` to `1`.

The states of the other variables (`m`, `j`, `k`, and `s`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state summarizes the unchanged variables and the modification made to the `dp` array.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [1][2][1] to 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
