The statement updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are referenced, where `k` is equal to `s`, and `j` is at least `1`. Because there is an if conditional statement about `j` relative to `k`, if `j` is greater than `k`, the assignment takes place, otherwise, no changes are made to `dp`.

Since the specific values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not provided, the output state can only reflect the conditions described. Therefore, the output state will note whether the assignment occurred or not based on the relationship of `j` and `k`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`, otherwise no changes are made to `dp`.**
