The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state remains as it was with no direct modifications.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and the value of `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[0][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
