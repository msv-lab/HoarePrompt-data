The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, without an explicit loop structure present in the provided context, it simply indicates that we are to continue. The values of the variables and the state of the program remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the values of all variables remain as they were initially defined.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` equals `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2; dp[0][3][k] is assigned the value of dp[0][2][k], and we continue without any change to the state.**
