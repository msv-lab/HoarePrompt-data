The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same, reflecting that the loop continues without any changes to the variables.

Output State: **`N` is valid, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
