Postcondition: ***`j` is less than `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The overall state of `dp` reflects these updates based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
