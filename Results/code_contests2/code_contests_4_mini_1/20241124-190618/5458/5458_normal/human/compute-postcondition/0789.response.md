Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated such that if `i` is 0 and `j` is at least `1`, `k` is at least `1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures that `dp` reflects the appropriate values based on the relationships between `i`, `j`, and `k`, along with the modular constraints.***
