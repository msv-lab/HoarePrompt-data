According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1, which is already satisfied since `s` is greater than or equal to 1. The loop variable `k` will start at 1 and go up to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` will equal `s + 1`, and since `k` starts at 1, it will iterate through all integers from 1 up to `s`. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and initialize `k` at 1. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0 or greater, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1, `k` is 1**
