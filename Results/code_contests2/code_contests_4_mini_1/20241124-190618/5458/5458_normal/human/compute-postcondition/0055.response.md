According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `k`, which iterates from `1` to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is `1`. To execute the loop again, `k` needs to be `2`. Since `s` is greater than or equal to `1`, it allows for at least one more iteration with `k` being `2`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` to `2` and we can retain the other states as they are, provided they are still valid for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0 or greater, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2.**
