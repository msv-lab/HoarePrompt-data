Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. There is no else part in the code, meaning if `j` is not greater than `k`, no modifications are made to the state.***
