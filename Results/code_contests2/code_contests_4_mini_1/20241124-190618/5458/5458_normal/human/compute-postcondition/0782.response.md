The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` updates a specific position in the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The bitwise operation `i + 1 & 1` will yield either `0` or `1`, depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd. The variables `j` and `k` are incremented by `1` and their previous values are known to be at least `1`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment that occurs in the `dp` array.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1, where `i` is `n`, `j` is at least `1`, `k` is at least `1`.**
