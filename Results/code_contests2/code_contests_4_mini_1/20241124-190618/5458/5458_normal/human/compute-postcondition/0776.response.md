The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the rest of `dp` remains unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
