Output State: **`N` is valid, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`; if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes occur in the state of `dp`.**
