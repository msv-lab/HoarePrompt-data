According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the condition `s`. The loop iterates over `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3, and `s` must be at least 3 (since `k` can only go up to `s`).

Since `s` is already greater than or equal to 2, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`. 

State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3**
