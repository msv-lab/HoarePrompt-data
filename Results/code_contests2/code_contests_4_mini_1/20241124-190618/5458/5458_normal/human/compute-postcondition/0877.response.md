According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2, and since `s` is at least 1, we can assume it remains unchanged. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect the updated value of `k`.

State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2**
