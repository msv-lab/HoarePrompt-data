According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relation to `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2, and `s` must be at least 2 to ensure that the loop can run again.

State: **`j` is less than `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2**
