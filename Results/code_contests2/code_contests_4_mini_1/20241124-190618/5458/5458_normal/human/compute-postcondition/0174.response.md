Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, while the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made and the program proceeds without executing the if block.***
