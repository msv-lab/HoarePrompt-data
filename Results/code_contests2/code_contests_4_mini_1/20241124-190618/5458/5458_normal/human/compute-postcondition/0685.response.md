According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4, and we need to ensure that `s` is at least 4 for the loop condition to hold true.

Thus, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `s` is greater than or equal to 4.

State: **Given that `N` is valid, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is 4**
