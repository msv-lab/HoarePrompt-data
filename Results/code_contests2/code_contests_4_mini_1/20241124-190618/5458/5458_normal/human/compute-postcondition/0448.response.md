Postcondition: ***`N` and `n` retain their values between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` retains its value between 1 and 3000. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. All updates to `dp` involve calculations that respect the boundaries of the indices based on the values of `j` and `k`.***
