Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than 3, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding it to the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. All changes to `dp` are made under the constraints of the variables as described, ensuring that the program state is consistent with these conditions.***
