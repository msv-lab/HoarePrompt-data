Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made and the program proceeds without executing the if block.***
