According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1, since `k` starts from 1 and goes up to `s`. Given that `s` is already stated to be greater than or equal to 1, this condition is satisfied. 

Since `k` starts at 1, its initial value does not need adjustment. However, it is important to note that the loop will iterate for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the start of the loop, `k` will be initialized to 1, which is the first value it will take on.

The state of `dp` does not affect the execution of the loop directly, but it is updated based on the relationships between `j` and `k`. 

Thus, the required state adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- `m` is at least 2, which does not need to be changed.
- `s` is greater than or equal to 1, which also does not need to be changed.
- `j` is 2, which does not need to be changed.
- `k` is initialized to 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`dp` is updated based on the relationships between `j` and `k`, `m` is at least 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1**
