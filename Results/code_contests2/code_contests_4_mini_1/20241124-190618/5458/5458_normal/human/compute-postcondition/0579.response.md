Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated at index [1][2][1] to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The variables remain consistent with their precondition values: `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged.***
