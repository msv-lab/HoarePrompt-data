According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s + 1`. To check if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `k` has not yet reached `s + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is at least 1, `s + 1` is at least 2. Therefore, `k` can take the value of 2 in the next iteration. 

No other states need to be adjusted because `s`, `m`, `j`, and `i` are not affected by the loop's next iteration. 

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is at least `s + 2`, `k` is 2, and `i` is an integer.**
