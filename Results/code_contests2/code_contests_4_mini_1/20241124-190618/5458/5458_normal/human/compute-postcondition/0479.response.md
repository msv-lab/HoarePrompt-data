Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp` is unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
