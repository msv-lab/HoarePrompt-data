The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop if one were to be present, and proceeds to the next iteration. Since no specific loop context is provided, we can consider that the states of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`N`, `n`, `m`, `s` retain their values; `m` is at least 2; `s` is at least 3; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
