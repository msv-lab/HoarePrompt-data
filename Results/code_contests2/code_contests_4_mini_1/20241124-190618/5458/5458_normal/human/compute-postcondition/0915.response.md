The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop continues without altering the state of any variables.

Output State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp` is updated accordingly, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
