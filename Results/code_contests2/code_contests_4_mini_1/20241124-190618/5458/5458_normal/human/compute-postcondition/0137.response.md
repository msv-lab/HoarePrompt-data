Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is equal to `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]` is assigned the value 1. There is no else part in the code, so no changes occur to the variables or the state of `dp` if `j` is less than `k`.***
