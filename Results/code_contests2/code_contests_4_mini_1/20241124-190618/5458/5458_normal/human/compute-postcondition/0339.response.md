The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified or returned, the output state remains unchanged except for the note about continuing in the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `dp` is initialized as a 2-dimensional list, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and we continue in the nearest enclosing loop.**
