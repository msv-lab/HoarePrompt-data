According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, meaning `k` will take values from 1 up to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is 1, and since `s` is at least 2, it means that the loop can execute again as `k` is still less than `s + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration of the loop, `k` should be adjusted to 2, while `s` remains at least 2 since it is not modified in the loop.

State: **`dp` is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2**
