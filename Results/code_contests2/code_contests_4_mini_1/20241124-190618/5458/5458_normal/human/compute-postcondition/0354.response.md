The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` executes an assignment operation on the 2-dimensional list `dp`. 

1. The value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` equals `1`.
2. The bitwise operation `1 & 1` equals `1`, so the first index of `dp` will be `1`.
3. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and since `k` is `s + 1` where `s` is a positive integer, `j + 1` will also be at least `s + 2`.
4. The `k` index remains unchanged as it is `s + 1`.

Thus, the assignment affects `dp[1][j + 1][k]`, setting it to `1`. The other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer greater than `s`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is `s + 1`**
