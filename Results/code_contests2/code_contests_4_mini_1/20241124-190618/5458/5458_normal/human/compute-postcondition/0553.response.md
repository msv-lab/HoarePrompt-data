Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values in the `dp` array, specifically `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and includes a modulus operation with `mod`. In summary, the state of `dp` reflects the conditions based on the relationship between `j` and `k`, while `i`, `m`, `s`, and `k` retain their respective precondition values.***
