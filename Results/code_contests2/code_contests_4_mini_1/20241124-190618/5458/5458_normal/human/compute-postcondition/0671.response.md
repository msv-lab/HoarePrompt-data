The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables do not change, but we skip the rest of the current loop iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is valid, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is now equal to `dp[1][j][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is valid, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is now equal to `dp[1][j][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
