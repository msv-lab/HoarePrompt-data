The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, it does not change the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the values of `N`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged after executing this statement. 

The output state is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
