To determine the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided conditions and the for loop construct.

1. The for loop iterates over `k` in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to the next value within this range.
2. The current state indicates that `k` is `2`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented to `3`.
3. The condition for the loop to execute again requires `s` to be greater than or equal to `2`. Since the state indicates that `s` is greater than or equal to `2`, it can support this increment.

No other states (`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`) need to be adjusted because they do not influence the loop's ability to execute again based on the current conditions.

Thus, the adjusted state will reflect the new value of `k`.

State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2**
