According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute one more time if `k` is incremented. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to 2. Since `s` is at least 1, it will allow the loop to continue as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted since `N`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `s` do not change within this for loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2**
