According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for values of `j` from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 1, and `j` is 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3, and it must still be less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, to allow for one more execution of the loop, `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`m` is at least 3, `s` is less than 1, `j` is 3, `i` is equal to `n`, and `dp` remains unmodified.**
