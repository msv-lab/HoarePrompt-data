The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement, but it affects the flow of control.

The output state remains the same for the unaffected variables. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is updated, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is updated, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
