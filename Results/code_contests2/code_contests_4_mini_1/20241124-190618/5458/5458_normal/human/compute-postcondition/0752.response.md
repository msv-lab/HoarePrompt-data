Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is at least `s + 2`, `k` is 3, and `i` is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes occur to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value. All cases maintain the constraints of the variables as stated in the precondition.***
