According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n`, `m`, `s` retain their initial values between 1 and 7. Since `n` is at least 1, `n ** 2` is at least 1 as well, meaning the loop can execute again.

To ensure that the loop executes one more time, `i` must be incremented. After the current iteration, `i` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again, it must satisfy the condition `i < n ** 2`. Therefore, we need to adjust:

- `i` to 1.

Other variables like `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` do not need to be adjusted since they do not directly affect the ability for the loop to execute again in the next iteration.

State: **`N`, `n`, `m` retain their initial values between 1 and 7; `s` retains its value between 1 and 3000; `i` is 1; `j` varies from 1 to `m`; `k` varies from 1 to `s`.**
