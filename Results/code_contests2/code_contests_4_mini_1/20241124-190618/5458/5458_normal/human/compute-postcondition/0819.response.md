The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables do not change due to this statement, the output state reflects that no changes were made. The values of `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` remain as they were. 

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
