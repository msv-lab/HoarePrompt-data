The value of `j` is 2 and the value of `k` is 3. Since `j` (2) is less than or equal to `k` (3), the program does not make any updates to `dp` and continues execution beyond this point. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 3, and no updates were made to `dp`.**
