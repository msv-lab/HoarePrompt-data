According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented from its current value to the next value in the range. Since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `s`, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. The state at the end of the previous iteration needs to reflect the next value of `k`.

Given that the state of `dp` has already been updated based on the conditions involving `i`, `j`, and `k`, we only need to adjust `k` to reflect its next value in the loop.

State: **`dp` is updated based on the relationships between `j` and `k`, `k` is the next value in the range, which should be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `s`**
