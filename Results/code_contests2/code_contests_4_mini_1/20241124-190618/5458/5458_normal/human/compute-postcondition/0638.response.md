The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Given that `j` is 2 and `k` is 1, we need to evaluate `k - j`, which results in `1 - 2 = -1`. Since negative indices are typically invalid in this context, it will not access a valid index in the `dp` array.

As a result, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged because the addition is effectively from an invalid index. Therefore, the output state reflects that the update does not change any values in the `dp` array.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged due to invalid index access**
