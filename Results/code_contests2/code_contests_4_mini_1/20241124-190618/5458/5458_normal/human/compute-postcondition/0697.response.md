Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 1`, `j` is `s + 1`, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no change to the state of `dp`.***
