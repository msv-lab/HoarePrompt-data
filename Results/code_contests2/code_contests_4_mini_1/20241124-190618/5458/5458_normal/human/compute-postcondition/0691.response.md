The code snippet modifies the `dp` array at the position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is currently 0, so `i + 1` is 1. The bitwise AND operation `1 & 1` results in 1. Therefore, the first index of the `dp` array becomes `1`. The value of `j` is at least `s + 1`, which will be incremented by 1, becoming `j + 1`. The value of `k` remains 1.

After executing the code, we have:
- The first index of `dp` is now 1.
- The second index is `j + 1`, which is still at least `s + 2`.
- The third index remains `k`, which is 1.

The output state will reflect that the `dp` array has been updated at the specified indices.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 1`, `j` is at least `s + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1**
