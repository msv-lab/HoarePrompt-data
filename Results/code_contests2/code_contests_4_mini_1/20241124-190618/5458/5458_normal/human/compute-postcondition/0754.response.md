Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is at least `s + 2`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, and `i` is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes occur to `dp` and the values of `s`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on both `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `s` is less than 1, then the loop does not execute, and all variables retain their initial values. If `j` is less than `s + 2`, the loop will execute but may not modify `dp` if the conditions within the loop are not satisfied.**
