The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index in the `dp` array. The indices are determined by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `dp` is updated based on the relationships between `j` and `k`
- `m` is greater than or equal to 2
- `s` is greater than or equal to 2
- `j` is at least 1
- `k` is at least 2

The specific calculation of the indices is as follows:
- The first index `i + 1 & 1` will result in either `0` or `1` depending on whether `i` is even or odd.
- The second index `j + 1` will be at least `2` because `j` is at least `1`.
- The third index `k` remains at least `2`.

Thus, the assignment modifies the `dp` array at an index determined by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly provided, we cannot specify the exact indices that were updated, only that one specific location in the `dp` structure is set to `1`. 

The output state reflecting the changes is as follows:
Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] to 1, where `j` is at least 1 and `k` is at least 2**
