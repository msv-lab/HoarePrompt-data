The code modifies a multi-dimensional array `dp` at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3, we can evaluate the indices as follows:

1. `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
2. `j + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1`, which is `3`.
3. `k` retains its value of `3`.

Therefore, the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` translates into `dp[1][3][3] = 1`.

The other variables `N`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are not affected by this operation, and their previous values remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state reflects the update made to the `dp` array, while the other variable states remain intact.

Output State: **`N`, `n`, `m`, `s` retain their values; `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1**
