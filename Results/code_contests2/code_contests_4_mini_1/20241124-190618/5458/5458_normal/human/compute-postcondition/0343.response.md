Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `dp` is a 2-dimensional list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][2][1]` is set to `dp[1][1][1]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][2][1]` is updated to the sum of `dp[1][1][1]` and `dp[0][1][k - j]`, each taken modulo `mod`. Thus, the state of `dp` can change based on the values of `j` and `k` in both branches of the if-else structure.***
