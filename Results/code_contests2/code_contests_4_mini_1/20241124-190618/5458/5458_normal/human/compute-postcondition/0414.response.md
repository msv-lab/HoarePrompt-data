Postcondition: ***`N`, `n`, `m` are integers with values at least 3; `s` is at least 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to 1. There is no change to the state of `dp` if `j` is less than `k`, but since `j` equals 3 and `k` equals 2 in the given precondition, the assignment occurs.***
