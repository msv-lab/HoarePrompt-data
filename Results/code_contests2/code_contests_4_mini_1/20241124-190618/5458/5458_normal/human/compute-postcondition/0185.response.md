Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. There are no changes made to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`, but this case is not possible since `j` (which is 3) is greater than `k` (which is 1).***
