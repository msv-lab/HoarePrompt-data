Postcondition: ***`N` is valid, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`.***
