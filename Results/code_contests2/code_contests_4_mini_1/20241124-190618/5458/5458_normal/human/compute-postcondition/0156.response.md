Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, reflecting that the state of `dp` has been modified accordingly. There are no additional actions taken if `j` is not greater than `k`, as there is no else part in the code.***
