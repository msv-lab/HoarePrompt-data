Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` has been updated based on the conditions provided in the loop, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise, no changes are made to `dp` or the loop control variables.***
