According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is at least `s + 1`, and `m` is at least `s + 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be adjusted to be at least `s + 2` so that `j` can take the value of `s + 1` in the next iteration. Additionally, `j` should be adjusted to `s + 2` since we are considering the next iteration of the loop.

State: **For `s` at least 1, `m` at least `s + 2`, and `j` is `s + 2`, after the loop executes `k` times (where `k` is between 1 and `s`), `i` is an integer and will remain unchanged throughout the loop.**
