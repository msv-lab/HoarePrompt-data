Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is equal to `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and then increased by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
