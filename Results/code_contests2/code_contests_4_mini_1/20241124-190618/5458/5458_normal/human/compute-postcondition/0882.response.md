Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues; if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no change to `dp` or the loop state.***
