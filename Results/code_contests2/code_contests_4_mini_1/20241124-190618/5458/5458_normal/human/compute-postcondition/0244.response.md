The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. However, there are no changes to the values of the variables involved. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values, but it indicates that the execution has skipped to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
