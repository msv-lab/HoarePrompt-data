Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2; if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes occur to `dp`.**
