The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead causes the execution to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same as before the execution of the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` is unchanged, and `dp` is updated based on the assignment.**
