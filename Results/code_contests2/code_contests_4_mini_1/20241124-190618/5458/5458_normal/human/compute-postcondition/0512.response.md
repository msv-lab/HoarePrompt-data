The `continue` statement is used within a loop to skip the current iteration and continue with the next iteration. In this case, it indicates that we will skip the remaining code in the current loop iteration.

The values of the variables do not change, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`j` is less than `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
