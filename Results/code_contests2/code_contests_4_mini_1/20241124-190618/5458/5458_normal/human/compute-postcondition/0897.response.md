According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` remains less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, and `m` must be at least 2 for the loop condition to still hold true. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be updated to 2.
- `m` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to s, `dp` is updated accordingly**
