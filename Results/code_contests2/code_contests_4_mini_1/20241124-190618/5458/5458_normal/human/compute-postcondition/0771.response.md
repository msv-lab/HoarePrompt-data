Postcondition: ***`dp` remains unchanged except at index `[1][j + 1][k]`, which is set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by assigning it the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`, or by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` otherwise. In all cases, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, and `k` is at least 1.***
