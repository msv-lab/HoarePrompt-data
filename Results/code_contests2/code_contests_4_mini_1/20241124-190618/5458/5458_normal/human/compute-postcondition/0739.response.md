The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the loop in which it is placed. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variable values. The values of `s`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `i` are still as they were, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `j` is at least `s + 2`, `k` is 2, `i` is an integer, and the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
