The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves a few calculations. 

1. The current value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`.
2. The bitwise operation `1 & 1` results in `1`.
3. The current value of `j` is `3`, so `j + 1` is `4`.
4. The current value of `k` is `2`.

The code assigns the value `1` to the array `dp` at the index `[1][4][2]`.

The state of the other variables (`N`, `n`, `m`, `s`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to the `dp` array.

Output State: **`N`, `n`, `m` are integers with values at least 3; `s` is at least 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `k` is 2; `dp[1][4][2]` is 1**
