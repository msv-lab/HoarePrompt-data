The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since the values of `N`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and the state of `dp` are not affected by this statement, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0 or greater, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]; we continue to the next iteration.**
