Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is equal to `n` and is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. There is no else part in the code, so the program does not alter the state if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
