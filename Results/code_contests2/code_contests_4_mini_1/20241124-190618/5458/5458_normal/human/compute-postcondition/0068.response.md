The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the values of `N`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `s`, and `k` are not altered by the `continue` statement, the output state will reflect that the loop continues without any changes to the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0 or greater, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and the loop continues to the next iteration without changes.**
