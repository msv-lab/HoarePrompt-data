Postcondition: ***`N`, `n`, `m`, `s` retain their values, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 2, and `k` is equal to 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, or if `i` is not 0, `dp[1][3][2]` is updated either based on the value of `dp[0][2][2]` or the sum of `dp[0][2][0]` and another computed value, taking into account the modulus operation with `mod`. The state of `dp` reflects these updates accordingly.***
