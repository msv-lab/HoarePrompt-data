Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0 or greater, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than 1, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is also updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
