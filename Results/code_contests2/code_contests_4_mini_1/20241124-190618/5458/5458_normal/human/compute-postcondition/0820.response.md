Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and skips to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not make any updates or changes to `dp` and continues execution beyond this point.***
