Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3; `j` is less than or equal to `k`, so no changes are made and the program proceeds without executing the if block.**
