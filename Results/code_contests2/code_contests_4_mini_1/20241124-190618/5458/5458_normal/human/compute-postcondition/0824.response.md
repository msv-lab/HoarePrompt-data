According to the code, the for loop iterates over the values of `k` from 1 to `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, we have `k` equal to 3, and since `s` is at least 3, the loop can proceed to the next iteration with `k` being incremented.

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be adjusted to 4. No other states need adjustments as `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, and the condition `k` being less than or equal to `s` are already satisfied.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `n`, and `k` is 4**
