Postcondition: ***`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][1]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][k]`. In the case where `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][1]` is updated to include the value from `dp[i & 1][3][k - j] % mod`, ensuring that all relevant updates to `dp` are reflected based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` while maintaining the conditions set in the precondition.***
