Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no change to the state and the loop proceeds without executing any further actions.***
