Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `k` is equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated accordingly. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
