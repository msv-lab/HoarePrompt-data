Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In the remaining case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All updates to `dp` preserves the modular arithmetic with respect to `mod`.***
