The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the loop to skip the rest of its body for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for all variables involved. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
