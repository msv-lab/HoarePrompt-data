The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the `dp` list at a specific index. Here, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2.

1. Calculate `i + 1 & 1`: 
   - `i + 1` is `0 + 1`, which equals `1`.
   - `1 & 1` is `1` (bitwise AND operation).
   
2. Calculate `j + 1`: 
   - `j + 1` is `1 + 1`, which equals `2`.

3. So, the expression updates `dp[1][2][2] = 1`.

The values of the other variables (`N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k`) are not affected by this operation directly, and since we don't have specific values for the `dp` list, we just note that `dp[1][2][2]` is now set to `1`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `dp[1][2][2]` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2**
