Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` has been updated based on the conditions provided in the loop, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][1]` is updated based on the preceding state of `dp` and may lead to invalid operations if `k - j` is negative, which should be handled properly to avoid negative index access.***
