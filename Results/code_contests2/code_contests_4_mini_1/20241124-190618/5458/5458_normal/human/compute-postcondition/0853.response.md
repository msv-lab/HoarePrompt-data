The code `continue` does not change the values of the variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration, assuming it is within a loop structure. The values of `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` remain the same. Therefore, the output state is `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 3, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 3, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.**
