Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. There is no change to the state of `dp` if `j` is less than `k`.***
