The values of the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the code indicates that we skip the current iteration of the loop and continue to the next one. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.**
