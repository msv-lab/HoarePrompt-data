The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged aside from the loop's control flow. 

Output State: **`i` remains `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
