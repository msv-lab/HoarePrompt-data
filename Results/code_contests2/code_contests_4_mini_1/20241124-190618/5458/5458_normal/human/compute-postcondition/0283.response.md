According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the variable `s`. The loop will iterate while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4. Therefore, `k` should be adjusted to 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 4, and `s` is at least 3.**
