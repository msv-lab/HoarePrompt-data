According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `k` in the range from 1 to `s` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than `s`. Therefore, `s` must be adjusted to be greater than the current value of `k` (which is `s`), and `k` should be set to `s + 1` to allow for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer greater than `s`, `dp` is a 2-dimensional list, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is `s + 1`**
