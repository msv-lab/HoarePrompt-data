Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1, specifically at `dp[1][3][2]`. If `j` is less than `k`, no updates to `dp` occur. All variable relationships and conditions from the precondition are maintained.***
