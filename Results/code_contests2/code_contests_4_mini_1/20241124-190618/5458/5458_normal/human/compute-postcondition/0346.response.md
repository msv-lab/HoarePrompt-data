Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, and `dp` is a 2-dimensional list. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, with `i` being 0, `j` being 1, and `k` being 2, and the updates to `dp` only occur based on the condition of `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to `dp`.***
