Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute the if statement, and no changes are made to the variables or the `dp` array.***
