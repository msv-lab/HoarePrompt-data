Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to the `dp` array.***
