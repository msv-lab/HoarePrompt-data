The value of the variables does not change due to the `continue` statement, which skips the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop. However, since the initial state states that `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is 1, we note that the loop is still in progress. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing in the loop without changing the variable values.

Output State: **`N`, `n`, `m` are at least 3; `s` is at least 1; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is 3; `k` is 1; `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue in the loop.**
