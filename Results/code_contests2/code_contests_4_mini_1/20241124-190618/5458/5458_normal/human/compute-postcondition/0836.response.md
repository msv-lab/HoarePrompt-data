Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `i` is greater than 0, `dp` remains unmodified, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no modifications occur.***
