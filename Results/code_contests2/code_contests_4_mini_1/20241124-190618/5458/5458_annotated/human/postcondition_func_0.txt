The function accepts three integer inputs (N, M, S) from the user in a loop until all inputs are zero. For each set of inputs, it computes a value using a dynamic programming approach and prints the result, which is derived from the 3D list `dp` based on the last values of N, M, and S. If N, M, or S are zero, the loop does not execute, and no output is generated. The function does not return any value and terminates when all inputs are zero.
