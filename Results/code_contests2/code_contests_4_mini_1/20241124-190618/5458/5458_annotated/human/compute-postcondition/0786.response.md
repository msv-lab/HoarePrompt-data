Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop, leaving the state of `dp` unchanged for the current iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the if block, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged for this iteration as well.***
