Postcondition: ***`S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. In the case that `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in the state of `dp`.***
