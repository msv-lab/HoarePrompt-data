Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Additionally, edge cases concerning the boundaries of `j` in relation to `k` are handled appropriately.***
