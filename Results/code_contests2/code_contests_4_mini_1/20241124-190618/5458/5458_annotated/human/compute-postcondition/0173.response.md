The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceeds with the next iteration. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`; `m` is greater than 0; `j` is an integer less than `m`; `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 3; and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
