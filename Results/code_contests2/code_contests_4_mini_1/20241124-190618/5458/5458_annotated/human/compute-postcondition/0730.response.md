The statement `continue` does not alter the values of any variables or affect the current state outside of skipping the current iteration of a loop. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The output state reflects that we are continuing in the loop without modifying any variables.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue in the loop.**
