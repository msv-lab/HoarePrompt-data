Postcondition: ***Given that `N`, `M`, and `S` are at least 1, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 2, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` added to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The modifications to `dp` depend on the values of `j` and the conditions of `i`, ensuring the updates respect the boundaries of the indices involved.***
