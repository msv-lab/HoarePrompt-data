Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is either 0 or greater than 0; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 3; and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program continues without any modifications to the `dp` array.***
