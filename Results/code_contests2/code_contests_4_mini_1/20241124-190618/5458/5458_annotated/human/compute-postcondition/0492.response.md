According to the code, the loop will iterate over `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `k` is currently 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `S` is at least 2, `k` can be incremented to 3. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`, which should be updated to 3.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M`, and `k` is 3**
