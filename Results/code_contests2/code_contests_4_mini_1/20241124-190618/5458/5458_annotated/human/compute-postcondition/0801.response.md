The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it will skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop that it is involved in and move to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables are not affected by this statement, the output state reflects the current state of the variables without any changes.

Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
