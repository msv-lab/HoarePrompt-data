Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on previous values, specifically adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. In all cases, the preconditions regarding `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.***
