The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but alters the flow of control by skipping the remainder of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state is that the values of the variables remain unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
