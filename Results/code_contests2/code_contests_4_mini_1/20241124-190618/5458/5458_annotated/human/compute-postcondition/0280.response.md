The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The initial state indicates that `j` is less than or equal to `k`, so the code does not execute the body of the if statement. Therefore, the values of `dp` remain unchanged for the given indices. The output state reflects that no changes were made to the variables.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and the values of `dp` remain unchanged for the given indices**.
