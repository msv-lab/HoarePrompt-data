The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the closest enclosing loop. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, but we note that we have skipped the remainder of the current iteration.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1, and we skip the remainder of the current iteration of the closest enclosing loop.**
