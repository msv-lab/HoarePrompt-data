The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the remaining code within the current loop iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are skipping the current iteration of the loop without affecting the variable states. 

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
