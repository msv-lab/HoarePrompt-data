The provided code assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The calculation depends on the current values of `j` and `k`. Since `j` is equal to `k` (both are `2`), the condition `j > k` is false, and the assignment does not take place. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `2`, `k` is `2`, `j` is `2`, and the block of code is not executed.**
