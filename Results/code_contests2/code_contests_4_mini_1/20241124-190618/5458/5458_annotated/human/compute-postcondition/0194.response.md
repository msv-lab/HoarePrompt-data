According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be `2`, and since the loop iterates while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `s` must be at least `2` to allow for the next iteration.

In summary, to allow the loop to execute again, we need to adjust `s` to be at least `2` since `k` will be incremented to `2` in the next iteration.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 2**
