Postcondition: ***`i` is `n^2` and is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. There is no change if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, and we proceed with the existing values without modification.***
