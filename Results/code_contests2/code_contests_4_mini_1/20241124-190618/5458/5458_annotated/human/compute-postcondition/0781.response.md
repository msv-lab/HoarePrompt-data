According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is in the range from 1 to `s` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Additionally, the value of `s` should be adjusted to ensure that it is at least 3, so that the loop can execute with `k` equal to 3.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3**
