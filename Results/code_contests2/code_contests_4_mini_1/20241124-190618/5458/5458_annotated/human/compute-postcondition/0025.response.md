The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the indication of the loop's behavior.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `dp[1][j + 1][2]` has been set to the value of `dp[1][j][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
