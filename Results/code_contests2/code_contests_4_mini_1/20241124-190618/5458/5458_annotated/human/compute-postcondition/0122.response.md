Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is less than `N`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. The conditions ensure that `j` must be greater than 1, while `k` remains at 1, maintaining the integrity of the indices involved in the array.***
