Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and if `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1; otherwise, no changes are made to the `dp` array. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
