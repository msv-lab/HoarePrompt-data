According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `S`. The loop will execute for values of `k` in the range from 1 to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is at least 1 and `S` is at least 1, which implies that the loop has executed at least once.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Since `k` is at least 1 at the end of the last iteration, we need to adjust it to reflect that the next value of `k` will be 2. This means that the loop can execute again as long as `S` is at least 2.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i`, `j`, are at least 1, `k` is 2**
