The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration without changing the values of any variables. Since `i` is less than `N`, we will proceed to the next iteration of the loop where the checks on `j`, `S`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that no variables have changed due to the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M + 1`, `S` is at least 1, `m` is at least `M + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
