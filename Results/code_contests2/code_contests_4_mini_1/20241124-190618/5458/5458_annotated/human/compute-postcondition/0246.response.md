Output State: **`i` is `n^2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`, otherwise no changes are made to `dp` and the loop proceeds without modifying the specified indices.**
