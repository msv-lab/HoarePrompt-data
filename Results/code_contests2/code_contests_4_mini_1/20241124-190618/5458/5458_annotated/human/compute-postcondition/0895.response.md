According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be updated to the next value, which is 4. However, since `s` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue executing, `s` will also need to be adjusted to be at least 4.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 4, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, and `k` is 4**
