The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The `& 1` operation is a bitwise AND operation that will yield either 0 or 1 based on the value of `i`. However, since we do not have the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, we can only describe the relationship. Other variables `N`, `M`, `S` are not affected directly by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
