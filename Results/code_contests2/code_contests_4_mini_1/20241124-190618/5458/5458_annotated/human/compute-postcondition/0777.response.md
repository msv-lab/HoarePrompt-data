Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, leaving the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` unchanged as it is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. There is no action taken if `j` is less than or equal to `k`.***
