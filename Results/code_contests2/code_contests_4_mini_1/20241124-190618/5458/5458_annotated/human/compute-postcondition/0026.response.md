Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to the value of `dp[1][j][2]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` array in this fragment.***
