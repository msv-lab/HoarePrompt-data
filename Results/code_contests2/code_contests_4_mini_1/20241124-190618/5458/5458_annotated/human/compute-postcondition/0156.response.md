Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer less than `m` and greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there are no changes to the values of `dp`, and the execution proceeds accordingly, maintaining the integrity of the variables involved.***
