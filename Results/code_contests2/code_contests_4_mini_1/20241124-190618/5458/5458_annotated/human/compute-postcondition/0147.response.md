According to the code, the loop will execute if the variable `s` is greater than or equal to 1, since the range for `k` is from 1 to `s + 1`. Given that `s` is a positive integer, it is already ensured that `s` is at least 1. 

At the start of the loop, `k` should be initialized to 1 for the first iteration, which is already the case since `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` should be 1 to start the loop execution, which is already implied by the definition of `k`.
- The current value of `j` can be greater than or equal to 0 but less than `m`, which is already stated.

Since all conditions are satisfied for the loop to execute, we can summarize the state as follows:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer less than `m`, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 1**
