Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is less than or equal to `s - 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. This implies that the condition allows for the updating of the dp array only when `j` meets or exceeds `k`, thus ensuring that the indexing remains within the bounds defined by `s`. If `j` is less than `k`, no change occurs to the dp array.***
