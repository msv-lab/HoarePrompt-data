Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M`, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring that the values of `dp` reflect the conditions and operations performed based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
