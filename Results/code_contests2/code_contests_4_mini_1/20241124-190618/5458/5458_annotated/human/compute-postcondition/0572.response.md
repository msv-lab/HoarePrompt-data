According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the value of `S`. The loop iterates from `1` to `S` (inclusive), meaning for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `S`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have `k` is 3 and `S` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4 (which means it can still execute as long as `S` is at least 4). 

Since `S` is at least 3 and we need it to be at least 4 for the loop to continue executing, the value of `S` needs to be adjusted to at least 4. 

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 4, `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 4**
