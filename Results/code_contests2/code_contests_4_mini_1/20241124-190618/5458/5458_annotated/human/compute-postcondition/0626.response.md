The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and move to the next iteration. However, it does not change the values of any variables directly. 

The values of `S`, `j`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and we simply continue to the next iteration of the loop. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
