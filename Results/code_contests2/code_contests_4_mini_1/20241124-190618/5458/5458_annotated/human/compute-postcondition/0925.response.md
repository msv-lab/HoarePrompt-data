Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` equals `s`, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the assignment modifies the `dp` structure such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` equals `k`, then no modifications are made to `dp`, and control continues to the next iteration of the loop. Additionally, the program maintains the constraints on `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` throughout its execution.***
