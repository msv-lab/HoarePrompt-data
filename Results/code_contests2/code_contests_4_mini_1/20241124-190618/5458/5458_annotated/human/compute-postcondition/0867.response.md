The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index in the multi-dimensional list `dp`. 

Here, `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` equals `1`. The expression `1 & 1` results in `1`. Therefore, the first index is `1`.

The variable `j` is `1`, so `j + 1` equals `2`. 

The variable `k` is `1`, and it remains unchanged.

Thus, the assignment is made to `dp[1][2][1] = 1`.

The values of `m`, `s`, `dp`, and the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1**.
