Postcondition: ***`S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value 1. There is no change to the state of `dp` if the condition is not met, but since `j` is fixed at 3 and `k` is fixed at 1 in the precondition, the assignment will always occur.***
