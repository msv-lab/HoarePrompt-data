According to the code, the loop will execute if `j` is within the range from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, which means it is currently outside the range of the loop. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 1, which is the starting point of the loop range. Since the problem states that `j` remains equal to `m + 1`, `m` must be adjusted to ensure that `j` can take a value within the loop range.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `m` to at least 1, and reset `j` to 1.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1**
