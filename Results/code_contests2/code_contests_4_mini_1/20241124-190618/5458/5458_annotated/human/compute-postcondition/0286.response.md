According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, which it is according to the given state (`s` is at least 1). The loop will initialize `k` to 1 at the start of the first iteration. 

Since `m` is at least 2 and `j` is `m + 1`, these values do not affect the execution of the loop directly. Therefore, the values of `m` and `j` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, but `k` should be set to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1**
