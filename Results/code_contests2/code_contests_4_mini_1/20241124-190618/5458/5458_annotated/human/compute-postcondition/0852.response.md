The code assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `j` and `k` are currently `2`, and `i` can be either `0` or not equal to `0`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to `1` if `i` is `0` and to `0` if `i` is not equal to `0`. Therefore, we have two cases for the output state.

1. If `i` is `0`: 
   - `dp[1][3][2] = dp[1][2][2]`
2. If `i` is not equal to `0`:
   - `dp[0][3][2] = dp[0][2][2]`

Since the actual values of `dp` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot specify the exact changes to the `dp` array, but we can describe the references made.

The output states will reflect the conditional nature of `i`.

Output State: **`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `2`, `k` is `2`, `j` is `2`, and if `i` is `0`, then dp[1][3][2] = dp[1][2][2]; if `i` is not equal to `0`, then dp[0][3][2] = dp[0][2][2]**
