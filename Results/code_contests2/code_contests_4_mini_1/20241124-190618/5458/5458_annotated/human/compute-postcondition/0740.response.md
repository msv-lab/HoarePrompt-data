Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][2]`, and the next iteration of the loop is initiated. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes to `dp` occur, and the loop continues to the next iteration without any further modifications.***
