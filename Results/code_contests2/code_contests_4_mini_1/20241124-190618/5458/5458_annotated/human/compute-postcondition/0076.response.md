To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement.

1. The loop is defined as `for k in xrange(1, s + 1):`. This means that `k` will take on values starting from 1 up to and including `s`. 

2. The variable `s` is defined as a positive integer. This implies that `s` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

3. The current state indicates that `k` varies from 1 to `s`. However, since `k` should start at 1 when the loop begins, we need to ensure `k` is initialized to 1.

For the loop to execute:
- `s` must be at least 1, which is satisfied since `s` is a positive integer.
- `k` should be set to 1 at the beginning of the loop.

Thus, the states can be adjusted as follows:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 3, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
