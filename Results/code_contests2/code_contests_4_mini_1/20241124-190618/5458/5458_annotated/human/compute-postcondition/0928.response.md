Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` equals `s`, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` and taking the modulo with respect to `mod`. All cases ensure that the conditions stated in the precondition are preserved.***
