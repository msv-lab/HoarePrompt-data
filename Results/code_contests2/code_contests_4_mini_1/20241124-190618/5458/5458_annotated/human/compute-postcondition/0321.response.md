According to the code, the for loop is determined by the value of `i` and the range it iterates over, which is from `0` to `n**2 - 1`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n**2`. At the end of the last iteration, we don't have the exact value of `i`, but we know it has been incremented by 1 for each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to be equal to the current value of `i` plus 1.

Since the loop runs `n**2` times, if `i` is currently the maximum value (i.e., `n**2 - 1`), the loop will not execute again. If `i` is less than `n**2 - 1`, it can execute once more by incrementing `i`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented by 1, thus becoming `i + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n**2`.

Therefore, the final adjusted state will depend on the current value of `i` but will generally reflect that `i` is now `i + 1`.

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is such that `n` is greater than 0 (to ensure `n**2` is valid)**
