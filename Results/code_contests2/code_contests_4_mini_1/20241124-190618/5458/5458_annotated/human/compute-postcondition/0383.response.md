Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no change in the program state as there is no corresponding else part.***
