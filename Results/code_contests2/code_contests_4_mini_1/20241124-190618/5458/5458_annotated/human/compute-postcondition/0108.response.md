Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is either 0 or greater than 0; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 3; `s` is a positive integer; `k` varies from 1 to `s`. If `s` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][k]` is set to 1 for each valid `k`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The loop executes `s` times, where `k` takes values from 1 to `s`.**
