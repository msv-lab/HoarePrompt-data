According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. The loop will run for `k` in the range from 1 to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2 for the next iteration. Therefore, `s` must be at least 2 to ensure that `k` can take the value of 2.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is 2**
