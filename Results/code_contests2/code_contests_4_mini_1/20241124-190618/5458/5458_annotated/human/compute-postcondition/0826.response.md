According to the code, the loop will execute for `j` ranging from `1` to `m + 1`. The variable `j` starts at `1` in the first iteration. If the loop has executed `s` times, it implies the last value of `j` at the end of the last iteration was `s + 1`, since `j` is incremented by `1` in each iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Given that `j` is at least `2` at the end of the last iteration, we can conclude that for the next iteration, `j` needs to be adjusted to `2` (the next value for the loop to execute). 

Additionally, since the loop starts with `j = 1`, after executing `s` times, and if `s` is at least `1`, then `m` must be at least `s + 1` for the loop to execute again; hence it needs to be adjusted to reflect that `m` is at least `s + 1`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` to `2` and `m` to be at least `s + 1`.

State: **`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` remains unchanged, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is 2**
