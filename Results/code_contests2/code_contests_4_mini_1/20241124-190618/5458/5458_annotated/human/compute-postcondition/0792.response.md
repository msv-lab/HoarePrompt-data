To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given loop and the states provided.

1. The loop iterates over `j` in the range `1` to `m + 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`. 
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is at least 1, indicating that `j` can be 1, which would be the first iteration of the loop. Since `j` starts at 1, if `j` is currently at 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next state for `j` would be 2, allowing for another iteration.
3. Since `m` is at least 1 and `j` is currently at least 1, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 2 for the loop to continue executing.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state:

- For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 2.
- The current state of `j` must be updated to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is 2**
