The code assigns values to `n`, `m`, and `s` by taking input from the user and splitting it into three integers. The initial state indicates that `N`, `M`, and `S` are all at least 1, but the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `s` will depend on the input provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned based on the user's input, while retaining the information that `N`, `M`, and `S` are at least 1.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values from input**.
