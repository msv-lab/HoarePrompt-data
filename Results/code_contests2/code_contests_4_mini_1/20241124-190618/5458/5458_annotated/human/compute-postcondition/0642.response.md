According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. Since the loop uses `xrange(1, m + 1)`, it will iterate from `1` to `m`, inclusive.

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `j` must be equal to `m` for the loop to finish. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `m + 1`, and `m` must be at least `1` (to ensure the loop can run). If `S` is at least `1`, it implies that `m` is also at least `1`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` should be updated to `m + 1` to indicate the next iteration.
- `m` should remain unchanged to keep the loop's range valid.

State: **If S is at least 1, then `k` will be at most `s`, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is unchanged**.
