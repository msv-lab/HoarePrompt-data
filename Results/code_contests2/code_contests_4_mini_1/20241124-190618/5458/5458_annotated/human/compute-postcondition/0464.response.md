Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are at least 1; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is at least 1; `k` is 3; `s` is at least 3; if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`; if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` array, and the subsequent loop iteration continues.**
