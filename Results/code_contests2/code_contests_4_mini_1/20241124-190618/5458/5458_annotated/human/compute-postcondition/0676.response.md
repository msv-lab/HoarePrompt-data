To determine the adjusted states for the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop iterates over `k` in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. Given the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is at least 1
- `m` is at least 1
- `s` is at least 2
- `i` is 0
- `j` is at least 1
- `k` is 2

The loop will continue iterating while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Currently, `k` is 2. For the next iteration, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `k` to be 3, and we must ensure that `s` is at least 3 (since `s` must be greater than or equal to `k` for the loop to continue).

We do not need to adjust `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, or `j`, as their current states are sufficient for the loop to run again.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 3**
