The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there are no changes to the state of the variables from this statement and it does not affect any variable values, the values of `S`, `j`, `m`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
