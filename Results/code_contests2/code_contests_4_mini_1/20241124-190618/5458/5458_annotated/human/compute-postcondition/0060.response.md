Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` array.***
