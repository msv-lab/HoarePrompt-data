Output State: **If `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M`, and `S` is at least 1, the loop will execute for `k` from 1 to `S`. After the loop executes:
- If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
- If `i` is greater than 0 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j][k] % mod`.
- If `i` is greater than 0 and `j <= k`, then `dp[i + 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j][k] % mod + dp[i][j][k - j] % mod`.

It is important to note that if `S` is less than 1, or if `i` is not less than `N`, or `j` is less than `M`, the loop will not execute, and the values of `dp` will remain unchanged. The variables `N`, `M`, and `S` remain at least 1, `i` remains less than `N`, and `j` remains at least `M`.**
