The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` affects the `dp` array. The specific indices are calculated as follows:

- The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so it is unknown.
- The value of `j` is given as `2`, so `j + 1` will equal `3`.
- The value of `k` is given as `3`.

Thus, the indices used in the assignment are:

- `i + 1 & 1`: This expression will result in either `0` or `1`, depending on the value of `i`.
- `j + 1`: This is `3`.
- `k`: This is `3`.

The assignment sets the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]` to `1`. The values of `S`, `m`, `j`, and `k` are unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `S` is at least 3,
- `m` is at least 2,
- `j` remains 2,
- `k` is 3,
- and `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]` is now set to `1`.

Output State: **`S` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` remains 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]` is set to 1**.
