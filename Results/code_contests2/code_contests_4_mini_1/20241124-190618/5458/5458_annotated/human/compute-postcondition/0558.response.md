The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration instead. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
