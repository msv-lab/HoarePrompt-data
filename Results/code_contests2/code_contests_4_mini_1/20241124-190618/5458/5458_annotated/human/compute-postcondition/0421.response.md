According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `S`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, the states indicate that `k` is 2 and `S` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to increase to 3, and we must ensure that `S` is at least 3 to allow for this increment.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is 3**
