According to the code, the loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, which means that for the next iteration, `k` should be increased by 1, making it `k + 1`. 

Since `s` is at least 1, `k` would need to be adjusted to `s + 1` for the loop to continue executing. Additionally, `i` and `j` are not dependent on the loop iteration over `k`, so they remain unchanged. 

State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` equals `s + 1`, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
