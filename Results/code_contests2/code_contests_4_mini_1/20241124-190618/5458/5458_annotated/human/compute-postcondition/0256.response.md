Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, effectively meaning `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1 when `j` is at least 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` array.***
