According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop runs from `k = 1` to `k = s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least greater than or equal to 3, allowing `k` to take the value of 3 in the next iteration. Additionally, since the loop variable `k` increments with each iteration, the next value of `k` should be 3. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are that `s` must be at least 3, and `k` should be updated to 3.

State: **If `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M + 1`, `S` is at least 1, `m` is at least `M + 1`, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
