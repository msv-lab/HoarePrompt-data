Postcondition: ***`S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. There is no else part, so no changes occur if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
