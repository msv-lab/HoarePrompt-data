The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the remainder of the current loop iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M`, `k` is 3, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M`, `k` is 3, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.**
