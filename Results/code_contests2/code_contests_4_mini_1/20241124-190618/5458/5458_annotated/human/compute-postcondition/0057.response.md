Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is either 0 or greater than 0; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2; if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` is set to 1, which means `dp[1][3][2] = 1` if `i` is 0 or `dp[0][3][2] = 1` if `i` is greater than 0.***
