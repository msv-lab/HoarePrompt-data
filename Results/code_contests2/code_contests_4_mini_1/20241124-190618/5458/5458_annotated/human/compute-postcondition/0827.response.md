According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. The loop will iterate from `1` to `s`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least `1`. 

Given that `m` is at least `s + 1`, it implies that `s` is at least `0`. However, since we need `s` to be greater than or equal to `1` for the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `s` is indeed at least `1`. The variable `k` will take values starting from `1` and will be `1` at the start of the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `1`, `k` is `1`, `j` is `2`**
