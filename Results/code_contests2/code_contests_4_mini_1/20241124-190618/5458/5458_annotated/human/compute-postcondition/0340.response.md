Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no effect on `dp` and the execution proceeds to the next iteration without changes to the current state.***
