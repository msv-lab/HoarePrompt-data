According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from 0 to `n ** 2 - 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented to 1 for the loop to execute again.

The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `dp` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop control variable `i`.

State: **If `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `dp` remains as it is.**
