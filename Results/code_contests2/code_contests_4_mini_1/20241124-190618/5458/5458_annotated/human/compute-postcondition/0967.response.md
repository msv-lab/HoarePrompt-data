According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for `i` in the range from 0 to `n ** 2 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, which means it could potentially be any value from 0 up to `n ** 2 - 1`. 

If `i` is already `n ** 2 - 1`, then it cannot execute again, as the loop has reached its limit. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to `n ** 2`, which would be the next value in the range.

Thus, the key states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be adjusted to `n ** 2` to allow for another iteration of the loop.

No other states need to be adjusted because `m` is at least 1, `s` is the initial value, and the other conditions for loop execution do not change.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is the initial value, `i` is `n ** 2`, and for each `j` from 1 to `m`, `k` varies from 1 to `s`.**
