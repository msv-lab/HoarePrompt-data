The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
