The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modifies the `dp` array based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The `&` operator performs a bitwise AND operation and, since `i` is less than `N`, `i + 1` will be at least `1`. This means `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either `0` or `1`, depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd.

The variable `j` is at least `M + 1`, so `j + 1` will also be at least `M + 2`. The assignment does not affect the other variables directly but updates a specific location in the `dp` array.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `i`, `j`, `S`, `m`, `s`, and `k`, but we note that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M + 1`, `S` is at least 1, `m` is at least `M + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
