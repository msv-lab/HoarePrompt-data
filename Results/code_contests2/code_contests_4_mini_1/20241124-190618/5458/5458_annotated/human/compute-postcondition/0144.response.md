According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `k` is 3 and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to increase to 4, and `s` should be at least 4 to accommodate that increment.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is equal to 4.**
