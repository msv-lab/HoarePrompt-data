Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][j][k]`. In all other cases, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation with `dp[1][j][k]` and the value of `dp[0][j][k - j]`. The overall state of `dp` is modified according to these conditions.***
