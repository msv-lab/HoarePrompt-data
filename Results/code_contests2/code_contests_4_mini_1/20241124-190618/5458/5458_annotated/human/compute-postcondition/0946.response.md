The assignment updates the value of `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to `1`. The value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` becomes `1`, and `1 & 1` evaluates to `1`. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is less than or equal to `s - 1`, but the specific values of `j`, `k`, and `s` are not provided, so they remain unspecified. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is less than or equal to `s - 1, and dp[1][j + 1][k] is set to 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is less than or equal to `s - 1, and dp[1][j + 1][k] is set to 1**
