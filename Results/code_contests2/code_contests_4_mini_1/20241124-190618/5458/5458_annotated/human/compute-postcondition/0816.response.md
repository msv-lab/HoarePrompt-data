The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index in a multi-dimensional list or array `dp`. The indices depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The variables `m`, `s`, `k`, and `j` are not directly modified by this operation, but their values influence which indices of `dp` are being accessed and modified. 

Since `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and `j` is at least 2, we can infer that `j + 1` is at least 3 and `k` is 3. The value of `i` is not specified, so it could affect the result based on its current value. However, the exact state of `dp` cannot be determined without knowing `i` and the structure of `dp`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the known variables and the change that occurs to `dp`.

Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, `j` is at least 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
