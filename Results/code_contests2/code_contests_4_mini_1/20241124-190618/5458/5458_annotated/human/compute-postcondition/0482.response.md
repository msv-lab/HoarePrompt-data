Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are at least 1, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M`, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][1] % mod`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is updated to include the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][0] % mod`, where `k - j` is still valid. In all cases, the necessary updates to the `dp` array occur based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
