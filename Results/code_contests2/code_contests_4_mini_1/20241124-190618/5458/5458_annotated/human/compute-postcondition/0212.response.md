According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from `1` to `s + 1`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `s` must be at least `4` (since it needs to be greater than or equal to `3`, and the loop starts at `1`).

At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `s` is at least `3`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` needs to be adjusted to be at least `4`. The value of `j` does not need adjustment since it is already equal to `m + 1`, which is not affected by the loop iteration. The value of `k` does not need adjustment either, as it will be updated in the loop.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 3**
