The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables do not change, but we effectively skip the remainder of the current loop iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values. 

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip the current loop iteration.**
