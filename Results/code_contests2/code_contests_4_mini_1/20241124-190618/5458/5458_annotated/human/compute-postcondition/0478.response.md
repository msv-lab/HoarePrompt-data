The statement `continue` causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is in and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified or affected directly by this statement, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values along with the indication that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `M` and greater than 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
