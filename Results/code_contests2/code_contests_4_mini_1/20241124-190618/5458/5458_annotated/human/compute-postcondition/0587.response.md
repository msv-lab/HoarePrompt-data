Postcondition: ***`S` is at least 1, `dp` is modified at index `[1][3][1]` to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value. Throughout this process, `m` is at least 2, `j` remains 2, and `k` remains 1. All updates to `dp` are performed under these conditions.***
