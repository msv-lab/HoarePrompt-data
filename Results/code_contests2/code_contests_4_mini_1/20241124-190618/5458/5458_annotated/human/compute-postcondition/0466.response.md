Postcondition: ***Given that `N`, `M`, and `S` are at least 1, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is taken from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, plus the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This ensures that all updates to `dp` properly reflect the conditions based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
