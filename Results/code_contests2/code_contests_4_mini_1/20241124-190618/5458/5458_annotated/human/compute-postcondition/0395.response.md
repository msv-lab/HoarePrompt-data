Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Overall, the updates to `dp` depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, ensuring all conditions are handled appropriately.***
