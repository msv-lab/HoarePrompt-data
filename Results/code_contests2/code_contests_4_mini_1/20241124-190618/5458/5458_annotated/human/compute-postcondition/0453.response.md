The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the indication that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
