Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, specifically `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. There is no change to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`.***
