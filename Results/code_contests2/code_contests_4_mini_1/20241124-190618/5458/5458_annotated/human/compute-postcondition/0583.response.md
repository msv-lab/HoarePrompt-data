The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the fact that we acknowledge that we are continuing to the next iteration. 

Output State: **`S` is at least 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `m` is at least 2, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
