Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program fragment does not execute any updates to `dp`, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
