Output State: **If `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once with `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. After the loop executes `s` times, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the conditions involving `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be 1 for each `k`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will hold the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `s` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the values of all variables remain unchanged. Additionally, edge cases where `j` is equal to `k` or less than `k` are handled to ensure all scenarios are covered correctly.**
