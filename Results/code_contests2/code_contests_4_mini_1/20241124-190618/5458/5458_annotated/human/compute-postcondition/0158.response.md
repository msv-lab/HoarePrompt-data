Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer less than `m` and greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod added to it.**
