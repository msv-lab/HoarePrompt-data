Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the array `dp` is modified at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] by assigning it the value from index [i + 1 & 1][j][k], and the program continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no modification to `dp` occurs, and the program does not execute the contents of the if block. The conditions for `s`, `m`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged throughout the program.***
