Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, and `k` equals `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is also updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, ensuring that all updates are computed under modulo conditions.***
