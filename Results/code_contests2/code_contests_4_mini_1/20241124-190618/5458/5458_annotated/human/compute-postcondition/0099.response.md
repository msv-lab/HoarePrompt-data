The code snippet `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional list or array `dp`. 

1. First, we calculate the indices:
   - `i + 1 & 1`: Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` equals 1. The expression `1 & 1` results in 1. So, the first index is 1.
   - `j + 1`: Since `j` is 3, `j + 1` equals 4. So, the second index is 4.
   - `k`: `k` is 3, so the third index remains 3.

2. The assignment `dp[1][4][3] = 1` sets the value at the specified index of the `dp` array to 1. 

3. There are no other variables affected by this operation, and no variables are changed.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and the assignment made to the `dp` array.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; `dp[1][4][3]` is 1**
