According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. To execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `k` should be adjusted to 3, and since `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 3**
