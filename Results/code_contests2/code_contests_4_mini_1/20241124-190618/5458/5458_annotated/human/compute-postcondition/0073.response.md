According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The variable `k` is currently set to 3, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4. Additionally, since `s` is greater than or equal to 3, it allows for `k` to go up to 4 without exceeding the limit of `s + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, which means for the next iteration, `k` needs to be 4. No other states need to be adjusted as the other variables do not affect the loop execution in this context.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is 4**
