The `continue` statement indicates that the current iteration of the loop will be skipped, and the next iteration will start immediately. The values of the variables themselves do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer less than `m`, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
