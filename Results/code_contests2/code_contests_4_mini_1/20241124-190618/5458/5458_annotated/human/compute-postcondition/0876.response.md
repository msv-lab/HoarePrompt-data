Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is either 0 or greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1; otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged for this case. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, leaving the rest of `dp` unchanged. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, `dp` remains unchanged except for the specified updates. The values of `j` and `k` influence how `dp` is modified, ensuring the program handles scenarios when `j` equals `k`, as well as when `j` exceeds or is less than `k`.***
