According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration, we know `k` is currently 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted to 2. The rest of the states do not need to be modified, as they are not dependent on `k`.

State: **`S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 2**
