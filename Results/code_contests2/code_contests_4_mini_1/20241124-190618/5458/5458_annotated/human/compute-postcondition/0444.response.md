The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
