Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][3]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not modify `dp` and proceeds to the next line of code after this block.***
