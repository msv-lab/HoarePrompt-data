The code assigns the value `1` to the array `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is `0`, `j` is `3`, and `k` is `1`, we can calculate the indices:

- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- `j + 1` gives `3 + 1`, which is `4`.

Thus, the assignment is made to `dp[1][4][1]`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value 1**.
