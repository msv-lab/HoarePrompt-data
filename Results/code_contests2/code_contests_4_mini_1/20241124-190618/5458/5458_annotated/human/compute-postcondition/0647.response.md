According to the code, the `while 1` loop will always execute indefinitely because the condition is always true. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `N^2 - 1`, `j` is at least 1 and at most `M`, `k` is at least 1 and at most `S`, and the value at `dp[n`**
