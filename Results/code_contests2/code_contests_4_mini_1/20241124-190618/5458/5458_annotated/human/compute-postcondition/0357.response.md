The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables do not change due to the `continue` statement, but it indicates that we will skip the remaining code within the loop for this iteration.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
