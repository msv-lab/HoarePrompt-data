Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[1][j][k]`. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is modified using `dp[1][j][k] % mod` and the value from `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`. All changes ensure that the relationships between the indices of `dp` are preserved according to the specified conditions.***
