Output State: **If `i` is less than `N` and `s` is at least 1, then after the loop executes, `k` will take values from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 for each relevant `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, both taken modulo `mod`. If `i` is equal to or greater than `N`, or if `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, leaving `dp` unchanged in that case.**
