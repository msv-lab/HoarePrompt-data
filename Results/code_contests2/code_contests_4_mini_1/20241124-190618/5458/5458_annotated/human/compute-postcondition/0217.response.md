According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for `j` starting from `1` to `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least `1`. Additionally, the loop starts with `j` at `1`. 

Since `i` is `n^2` and doesn't influence the execution of the loop, it remains unchanged. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are that `m` must be greater than or equal to `1`, and the loop variable `j` will start at `1`.

State: **`i` is `n^2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
