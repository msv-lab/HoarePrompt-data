Postcondition: ***If `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M + 1`, `S` is at least 1, `m` is at least `M + 1`, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2; if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring the result is computed modulo `mod`.***
