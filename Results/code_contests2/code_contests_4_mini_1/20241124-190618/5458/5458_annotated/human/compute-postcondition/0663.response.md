Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop and updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In this case, the state of `dp` is modified without any return or output, and no else part is present.***
