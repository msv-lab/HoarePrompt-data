According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from `1` to `s`, inclusive. Since `s` is at least 1, the loop will indeed execute at least once, starting with `k` equal to `1`. The current values of `m`, `i`, `dp`, and `j` do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the only states that need to be adjusted are `k`, which will start at `1`, and we need to confirm that the loop can indeed execute. 

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
