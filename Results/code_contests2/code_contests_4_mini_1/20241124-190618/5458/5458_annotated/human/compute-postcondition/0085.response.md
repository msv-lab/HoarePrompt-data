Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 3, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues execution. There is no change to `dp` or control flow if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
