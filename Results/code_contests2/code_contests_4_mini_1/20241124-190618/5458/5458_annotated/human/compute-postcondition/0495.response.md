The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` do not directly change, but the operation affects the `dp` array based on the indices derived from `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

The previous values are as follows:
- `i` is less than `N` (at least 1)
- `j` is at least `M` (at least 1)
- `k` is 3

This means the specific values of `dp` are being updated, but the exact values of `dp` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot specify the new state of `dp`, but we understand that an assignment is taking place.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M`, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**.
