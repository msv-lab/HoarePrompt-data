Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of itself and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. In all cases, if `j` is greater than `k`, there is no change to `dp` other than potentially setting the value to 1 when `j` equals `k`.***
