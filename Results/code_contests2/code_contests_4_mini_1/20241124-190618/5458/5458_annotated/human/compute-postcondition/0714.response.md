The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change with this statement, but it indicates that we are moving past the current loop iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
