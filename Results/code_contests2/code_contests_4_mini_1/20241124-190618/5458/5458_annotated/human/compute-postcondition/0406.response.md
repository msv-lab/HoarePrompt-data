The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `k` are not directly relevant to the assignment itself, but we note that `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is 1. 

The impacted variable is `dp`, where the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The exact numeric values at these indices are not provided, thus we cannot specify them.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
