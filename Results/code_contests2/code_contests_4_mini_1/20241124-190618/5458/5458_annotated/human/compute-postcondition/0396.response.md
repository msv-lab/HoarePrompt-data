According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and since `S` is at least 3, the loop can execute for `k` values up to `S`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to 4.

Thus, the necessary adjustments will be:
- `k` needs to be adjusted to 4.

No other states need to be adjusted because `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged and do not impact the ability of the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 4.**
