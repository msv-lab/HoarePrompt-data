Postcondition: ***If `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M + 1`, `S` is at least 1, `m` is at least `M + 1`, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3, then if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures that all relevant updates to the `dp` array are accounted for based on the conditions of `i` and `j`.***
