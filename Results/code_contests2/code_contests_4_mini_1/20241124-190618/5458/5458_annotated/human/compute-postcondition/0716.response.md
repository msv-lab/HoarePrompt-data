The program evaluates the condition `if j > k`. Given that `j` is at least 2 and `k` is 3, the condition `j > k` evaluates to false. Therefore, the program does not execute the block inside the `if` statement, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged.**
