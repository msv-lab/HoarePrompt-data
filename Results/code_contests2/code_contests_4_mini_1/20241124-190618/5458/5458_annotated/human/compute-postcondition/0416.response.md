The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
