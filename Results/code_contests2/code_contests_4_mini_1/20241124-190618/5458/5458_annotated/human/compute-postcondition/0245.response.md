Postcondition: ***`i` is `n^2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the state of `dp` at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp` at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp` and the loop proceeds without modifying the specified indices.***
