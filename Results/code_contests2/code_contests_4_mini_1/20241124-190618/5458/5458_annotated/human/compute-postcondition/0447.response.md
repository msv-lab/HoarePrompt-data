The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. This means that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the previous state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Next, the statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` indicates that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` (which was just updated) will now be further incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Since the current values of `dp` and `mod` are not provided, the exact values cannot be calculated, but the overall state will reflect the updates made to `dp`.

Thus, the output state will be:
Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
