Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][4][3]` is updated with the value of `dp[0][3][3] % mod`, and `dp[1][4][3]` is also incremented by `dp[0][3][0] % mod`. In all cases, the state of `dp` is modified based on the conditions of `j` relative to `k`.***
