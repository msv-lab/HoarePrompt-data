The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves assigning the value `1` to a specific element in a 3D array `dp`. The indices used in the assignment are determined by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` equals `1`. Therefore, `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- `j` is at least `1`, so `j + 1` will be at least `2`.
- `k` is at least `1`.

No other variables are affected by this assignment.

After the execution:
- `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the assignment made to the `dp` structure.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**.
