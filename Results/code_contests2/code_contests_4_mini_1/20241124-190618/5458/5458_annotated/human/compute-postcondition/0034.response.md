The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
