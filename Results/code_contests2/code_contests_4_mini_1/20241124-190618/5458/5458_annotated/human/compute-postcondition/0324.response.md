According to the code, the `while 1` loop is a loop that will always execute indefinitely, as it is designed to run forever. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the variables `N`, `M`, or `S` for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1**
