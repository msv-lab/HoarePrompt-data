Postcondition: ***`S` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, we skip the current iteration of the loop and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program continues without executing the block, leaving the values of `dp` unchanged.***
