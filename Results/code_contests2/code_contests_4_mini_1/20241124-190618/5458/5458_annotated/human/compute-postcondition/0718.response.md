Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k` and greater than 0, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[0][j][k]` and `dp[0][j][k - j]`, specifically `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[0][j][k] % mod` and also increments by `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, the dp state is modified accordingly based on the given conditions.***
