Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and if not, it's updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures that the appropriate values are assigned to `dp` based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
