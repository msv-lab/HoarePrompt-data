According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`, which is incremented in the loop from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, meaning the loop has reached its upper limit. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Since `k` is currently equal to `s`, it needs to be adjusted to `k` is equal to `s + 1` to reflect that the loop is moving past its current limit. 

As a result, the variable `j` remains unchanged since its condition is greater than or equal to `k`, and `i` is unaffected by the loop's execution.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`**
