Postcondition: ***If `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M + 1`, `S` is at least 1, `m` is at least `M + 1`, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3, then if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur, and the loop continues to the next iteration as well.***
