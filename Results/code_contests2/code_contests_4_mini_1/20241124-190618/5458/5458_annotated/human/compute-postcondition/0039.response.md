According to the code, the loop executes as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `k` to reflect this increment.

Since `k` is being iterated from 1 to `s`, and given that `N`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `s` do not change their constraints based on the loop execution, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `k`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 4, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1.**
