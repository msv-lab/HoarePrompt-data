The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the variables. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer less than `m` and greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
