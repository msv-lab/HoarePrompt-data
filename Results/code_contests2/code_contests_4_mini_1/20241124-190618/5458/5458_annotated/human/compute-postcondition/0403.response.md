Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. There is no change to the state of the program if `j` is less than `k`, as there is no else part in the code.***
