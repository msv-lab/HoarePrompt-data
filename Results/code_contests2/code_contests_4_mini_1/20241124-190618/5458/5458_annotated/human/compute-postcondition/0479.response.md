Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, and `S` are at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `M` and greater than 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration.***
