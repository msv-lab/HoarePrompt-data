The condition checks if `j` (which is 3) is greater than `k` (which is also 3). Since `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not modify `dp` and proceeds to the next line of code after this block. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; and `dp` remains unchanged.**
