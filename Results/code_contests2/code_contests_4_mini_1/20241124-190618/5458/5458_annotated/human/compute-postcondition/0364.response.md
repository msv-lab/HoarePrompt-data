According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `M`. The loop will execute for values of `j` starting from 1 to `M` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1, and `M` is at least 1, indicating that the loop has executed at least once.

To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `j` should be incremented by 1. Since `j` is currently at least 1, it can be adjusted to at least 2.
- `M` should remain at least 1 to ensure that the loop can still execute.

Thus, the states to be adjusted are:
- `j` is at least 2 (this means the loop will now iterate for `j = 2`).

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is at least 1**
