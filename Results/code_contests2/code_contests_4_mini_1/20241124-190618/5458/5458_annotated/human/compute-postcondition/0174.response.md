Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer less than `m`, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][3]`, and the program continues to the next iteration; otherwise, no changes occur to `dp` as there is no else part. This ensures that the state of `dp` is updated only when `j` exceeds `k`, maintaining the constraints on all variables.***
