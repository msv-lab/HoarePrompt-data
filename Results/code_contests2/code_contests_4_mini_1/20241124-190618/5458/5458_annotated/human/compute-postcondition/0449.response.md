According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relation to `S`. The loop will execute for each value of `k` starting from 1 up to `S`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 1, and `S` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `S`. Since `k` is currently at least 1, to execute again, we need to ensure `k` becomes 2 for the next iteration, and it should still be less than or equal to `S`. 

Thus, the adjustment needed is to set `k` to 2. No other states need to be adjusted since `N`, `M`, and `S` are already at least 1, and `i`, `j` remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2.**
