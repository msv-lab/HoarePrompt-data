The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned based on the input from `raw_input()`, which accepts a string and splits it into three parts, converting each to an integer. The previous values of the variables `N`, `M`, and `S` are unknown, but we know that they are at least 1. Therefore, after executing the code, `n` will be at least 1, `m` will be at least 1, and `s` will be at least 1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1**
