Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, and `k` equals `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there are no changes made to the `dp` array and the program proceeds accordingly.***
