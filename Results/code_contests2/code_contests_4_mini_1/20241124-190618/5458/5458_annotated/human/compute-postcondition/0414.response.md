Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is 2. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 when `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, which is the case here as `j` is 3 and `k` is 2. There are no other conditions or modifications to the variables in this fragment.***
