The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged during this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` equals `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the assignment modifies the `dp` structure.**
