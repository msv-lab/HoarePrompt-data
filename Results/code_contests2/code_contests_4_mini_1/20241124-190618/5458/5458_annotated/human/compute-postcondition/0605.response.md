Postcondition: ***`S` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` remains 2, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation with the values from the dp array, which includes adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This ensures that the updates to the dp array consider all conditions based on the values of `j` and `k`.***
