Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The program ensures that all updates to `dp` respect the modular arithmetic defined by `mod`, and that the boundaries of `j` and `k` are appropriately handled.***
