The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values from input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
