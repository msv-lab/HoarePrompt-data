According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop will iterate as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4, and this value must be less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, `s` must be adjusted to be at least 4. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `i`, `j`, and `n` are not directly affected by the loop increment, and their current values do not influence whether the loop will execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 4, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 4**
