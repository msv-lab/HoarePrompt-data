According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4. Since `k` is currently 3 and the loop iterates for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`, if `s` is at least 3, then `k` can take the value of 4 in the next iteration, provided that `s` is at least 4.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `k` to 4 and ensure that `s` is at least 4.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, and `k` is 4**
