The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks the current iteration of the nearest loop and continues with the next iteration. Since there is no information about the loop context in the initial state provided, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` equals `s + 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` equals `s + 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
