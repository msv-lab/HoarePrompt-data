The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but skips the remaining code inside the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same with no modifications to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and the assignment dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] occurs.**
