The `continue` statement does not change the values of `m`, `s`, or `k`. Instead, it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The previous values of `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
