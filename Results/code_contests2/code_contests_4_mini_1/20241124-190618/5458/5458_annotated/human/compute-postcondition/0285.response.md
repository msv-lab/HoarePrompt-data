According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `m`. The loop iterates from `1` to `m`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 2. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed `s` times, and for the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. 

Since `j` iterates from `1` to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `m + 1`. Thus, the state should reflect that `m` is at least 2 (to allow for at least one more iteration) and that `j` is `m + 1` after the current iteration.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`**
