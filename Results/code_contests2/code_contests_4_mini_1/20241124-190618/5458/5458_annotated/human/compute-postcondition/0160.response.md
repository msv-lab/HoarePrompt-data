According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2, and since the loop condition is `1 ≤ k ≤ s`, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer less than `m`, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2.**
