The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` updates a specific index in a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The operation `i + 1 & 1` calculates the value for the first index, `j + 1` calculates the second index, and `k` remains unchanged.

1. `i` is initially 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to 1.
2. `j` is at least 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, which is equal to `s`. Therefore, `j + 1` will also be at least 2.
3. `k` is equal to `s`, which is at least 1.

Thus, the expression assigns the value `1` to `dp[1][j + 1][k]`.

Other variables `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` equals `s`, `j` is at least 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**.
