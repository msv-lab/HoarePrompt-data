Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is greater than 0; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 1; and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the code does not perform any actions related to this condition.***
