The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if any) and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that there is no change to the values of the variables.

Output State: **`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `1`, `k` is `1`, `j` is `2`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
