Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues in the loop. Otherwise, this block does not execute since there is no else part.***
