Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop while maintaining the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no actions are performed for this block, and the program continues without any changes to the relevant variables.***
