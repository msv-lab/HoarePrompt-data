According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2 in the next iteration of the loop. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, it can support this increment as long as `s` is at least 2.

No other states need to be adjusted as `i`, `m`, `j`, and `s` do not affect the ability for the loop to execute again based on the current loop's logic.

State: **`i` is `n^2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2**
