The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, it is assumed that we are within a loop, but the state of the variables does not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the variables defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `2`, `k` is `2`, `j` is `2`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
