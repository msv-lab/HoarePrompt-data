Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the block, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
