The code `continue` does not change any values of the variables but instead skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop. Thus, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.**
