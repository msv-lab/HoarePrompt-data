Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `j` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to `dp`. If `j` is equal to or less than `k`, the program does not execute the if block and proceeds with the current values of `dp` and the loop.***
