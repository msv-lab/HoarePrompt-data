The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the value in a multidimensional array `dp`. The indices used are calculated as follows:

- `i + 1 & 1`: The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. The expression `1 & 1` results in 1.
- `j + 1`: Since `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `j + 1` will be at least 2.
- `k`: The value of `k` is 1.

Thus, the array index becomes `dp[1][j + 1][1]`, where `j + 1` is at least 2.

The value at this specific index in the `dp` array is set to 1. Other variables (`i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1**
