According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `i`, which is initialized in the `for` loop and iterates from 0 to `n ** 2 - 1`. Since `n` is at least 1, `n ** 2` will also be at least 1, meaning the loop will execute at least once. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be set to the first value in its range, which is 0. There are no other adjustments needed for the loop to be able to execute, as `n`, `m`, and `s` being at least 1 does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
