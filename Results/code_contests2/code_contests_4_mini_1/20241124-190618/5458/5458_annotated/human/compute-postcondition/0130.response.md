The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop**
