The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` will affect the indexing.

1. `i` is currently `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`. Using the bitwise AND operation, `1 & 1` results in `1`.
2. `j` is `2`, so `j + 1` results in `3`.
3. `k` is `1`.

Thus, the code assigns the value `1` to the element at `dp[1][3][1]`.

The values of `m`, `s`, `i`, `k`, and `j` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables and indicates the assignment made to the `dp` array.

Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1**.
