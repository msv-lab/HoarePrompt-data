Postcondition: ***`S` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` remains 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute any updates for the `dp` structure in this if statement and the control flow will proceed according to the remaining logic of the program.***
