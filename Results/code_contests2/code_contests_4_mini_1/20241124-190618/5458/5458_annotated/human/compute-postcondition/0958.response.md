The code contains a `continue` statement, which causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. The values of the variables themselves do not change due to this statement.

The previous values are `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` has been updated to `dp[1][j][k]`. Since the statement does not affect these values, the output state reflects their current status.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
