According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `j` can take a value in the range from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 3, and `m` is at least 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented to 4, and `m` must be at least 4 to allow `j` to take this value. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be updated to 4.
- `m` needs to be at least 4 to ensure the loop can continue executing past `j = 3`.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 4, `j` is 4, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s`.**
