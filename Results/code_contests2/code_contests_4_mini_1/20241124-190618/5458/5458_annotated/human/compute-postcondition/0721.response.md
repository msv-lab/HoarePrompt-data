According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2 and `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `j` is currently at least 2, we can maintain the condition that `m` is at least 2. 

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, we need to set `j` to 3. The other states do not require any modifications.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is from 1 to `s`.**
