Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous state of `dp`, where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, `dp` is modified according to these rules, ensuring that it reflects the appropriate calculations based on the values of `j` and `k`.***
