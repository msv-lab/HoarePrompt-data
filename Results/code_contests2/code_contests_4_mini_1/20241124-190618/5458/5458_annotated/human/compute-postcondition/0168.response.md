Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer less than `m`, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then it is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This covers all cases, including when `j` is equal to `k` and when `j` is less than `k`, ensuring the appropriate modifications to the `dp` array based on the conditions.***
