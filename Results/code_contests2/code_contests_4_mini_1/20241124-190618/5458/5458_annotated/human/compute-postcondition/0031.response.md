The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the value of a multidimensional array or list `dp`. The operation `i + 1 & 1` computes the bitwise AND of `i + 1` and `1`. Since `i` is initially `0`, `i + 1` equals `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`. Therefore, the first index of `dp` will be `1`.

The variable `j` is still unknown but is at least `1`, so `j + 1` will also be at least `2`. The variable `k` is fixed as `3`.

Thus, the assignment will affect the state of the `dp` array at index `[1][j + 1][3]`.

The output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the updated state of `dp`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1.**
