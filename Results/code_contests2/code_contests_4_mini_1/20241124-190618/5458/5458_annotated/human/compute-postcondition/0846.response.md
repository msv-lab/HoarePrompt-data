The condition states that `j` is equal to `2`, and `k` is also equal to `2`. Since `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute the operation in the block that updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, there is no change in the state of the variables or the data structure.

Output State: **`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `1`, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, `i` can be either 0 or not equal to 0, and no operation is performed.**
