According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Currently, at the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4. Since `s` is at least 3, it needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is at least 4 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 4, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 4.**
