The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement, but the loop continues on to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same as before the `continue` statement was executed.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is greater than 0; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 1; `k` is 1; `j` is greater than `k`; and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] is executed, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
