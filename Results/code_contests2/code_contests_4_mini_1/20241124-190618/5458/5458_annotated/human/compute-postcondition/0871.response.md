The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variable `dp` remains unchanged as specified. The values of `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly altered by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the values of the affected variables without changing them.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1**
