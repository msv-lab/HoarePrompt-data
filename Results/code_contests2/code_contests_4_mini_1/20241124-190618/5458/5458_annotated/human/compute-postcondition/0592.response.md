The `continue` statement is executed, which causes the program to skip the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `S`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`S` is at least 2, `dp` is modified at index `[1][3][1]` to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
