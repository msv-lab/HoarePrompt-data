According to the code, the loop will execute if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at its last value and has been incremented by 1 after each iteration. Since `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `m`, to execute the loop one more time, `j` must be adjusted to be equal to `m + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to set the state variables accordingly. Assuming `m` is the maximum limit for `j`, and since the loop increments `j` after each iteration, the state needs to reflect that `j` will be `m + 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`**
