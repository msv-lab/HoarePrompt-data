The value of `j` is at least 3 and `k` is 1, so the condition `j > k` holds true. Therefore, the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. This operation does not affect the values of `s`, `m`, `j`, `k`, or `i`. The output state reflects the unchanged values and the assignment made to `dp`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
