Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; if `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes to the values of `n`, `m`, or `s`.***
