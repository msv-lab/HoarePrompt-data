Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and continues to the next iteration of the loop, effectively skipping the remaining code in the current iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program continues with the subsequent logic.***
