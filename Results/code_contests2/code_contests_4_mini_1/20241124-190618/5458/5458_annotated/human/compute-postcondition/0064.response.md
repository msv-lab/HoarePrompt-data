According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `s` is at least 2, it allows for `k` to be 3.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3.**
