According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must remain at least 2, and `k` should be incremented to 3.

State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and `j` is at least 2.**
