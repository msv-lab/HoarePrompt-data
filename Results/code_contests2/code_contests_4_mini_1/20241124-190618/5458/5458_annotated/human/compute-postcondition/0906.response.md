The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables directly. Instead, it causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one. Therefore, the output state remains the same, reflecting that we are simply continuing the loop. 

Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `k` equals `s`, `j` is 1 (greater than `k`), and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
