The code contains a `continue` statement, which does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop in which it is contained. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is either 0 or greater than 0; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
