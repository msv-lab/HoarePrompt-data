Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is equal to 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value 1; otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
