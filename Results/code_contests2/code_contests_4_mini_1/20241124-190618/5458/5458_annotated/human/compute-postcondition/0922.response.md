Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` equals `s`, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. There are no changes to `dp` if `j` is less than `k` since there is no else part.***
