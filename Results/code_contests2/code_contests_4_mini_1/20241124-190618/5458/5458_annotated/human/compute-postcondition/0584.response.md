Postcondition: ***`S` is at least 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1). When the condition `j > k` is true, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. In this scenario, the state of `dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. There is no else part in the code, so no changes occur if `j` is not greater than `k` (i.e., `j` is less than or equal to `1`).***
