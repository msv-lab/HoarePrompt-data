Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Thus, the potential updates to `dp` depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, covering all edge cases.***
