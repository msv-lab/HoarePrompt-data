According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 1, meaning `k` can execute one more time if `s` is greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must be at least 3 and `k` should be incremented to 3.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 3**
