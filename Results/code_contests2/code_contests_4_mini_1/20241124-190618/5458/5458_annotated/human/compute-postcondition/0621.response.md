Postcondition: ***`S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 1, and if `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value 1 since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
