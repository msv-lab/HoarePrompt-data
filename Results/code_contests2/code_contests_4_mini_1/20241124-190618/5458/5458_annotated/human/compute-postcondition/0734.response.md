Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and `dp[1][4][1]` is also incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `j` equals `k`, `j` is less than `k`, and the access of `dp` may lead to invalid indices based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
