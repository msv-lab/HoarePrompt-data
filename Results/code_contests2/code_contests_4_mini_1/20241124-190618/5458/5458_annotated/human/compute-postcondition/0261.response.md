Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the current loop iteration is skipped and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop continues without modifying `dp`.***
