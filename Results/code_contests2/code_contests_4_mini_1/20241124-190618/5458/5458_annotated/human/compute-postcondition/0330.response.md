According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `m`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `m` must be at least `1`. Given that `M` is stated to be at least `1`, this condition is satisfied. 

At the beginning of the loop, the index variable `j` should start from `1` (the first value in the range). The variable `i` does not affect the execution of this loop. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows: `j` is now 1 (the starting index of the loop).

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1**
