The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but skips the current iteration of the loop that `i` is part of. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop continues without modifying any variable values.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and we continue in the loop.**
