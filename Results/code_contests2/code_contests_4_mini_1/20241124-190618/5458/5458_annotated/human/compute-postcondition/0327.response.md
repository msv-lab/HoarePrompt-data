Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are at least 1; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values from input. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the program is terminating that sequence of operations. There are no other conditions for execution beyond this check.***
