According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop is set to iterate over `k` from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4, and `s` must be at least 4 to ensure that the loop can still run since the loop continues as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

Given the current condition where `s` is at least 3 and `k` is 3, we need to adjust `k` to be 4, and we can keep `s` as it is since it is allowed to be at least 4 for the loop to run again.

State: **Given that `N`, `M`, and `S` are at least 1, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 4, and `s` is at least 4.**
