Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is less than `N`; `m` is greater than 0; `j` is 1 or greater; `s` is greater than or equal to 1; `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. There is no change to the state of the program if `j` is less than `k`.***
