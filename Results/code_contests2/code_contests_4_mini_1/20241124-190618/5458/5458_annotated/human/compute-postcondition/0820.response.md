Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and `j` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the assignment, and the current state remains unchanged for this iteration.***
