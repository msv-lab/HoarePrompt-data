Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` will be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` will be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]` modulo `mod`, plus `dp[i & 1][2][k - 2]` modulo `mod`. In all cases, the indices used in the `dp` array will depend on the updated values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
