The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` do not change due to this statement. The state of `dp` is not directly affected either. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the variables involved, and we note that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is less than or equal to `s - 1, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
