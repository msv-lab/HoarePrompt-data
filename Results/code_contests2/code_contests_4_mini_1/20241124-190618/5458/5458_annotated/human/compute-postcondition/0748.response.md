The values of the variables do not change but the `continue` statement causes the execution to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0 or incremented, `j` is unchanged, `k` is less than or equal to `s (specifically, `k` is the previous value plus 1), and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
