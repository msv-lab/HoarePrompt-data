The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the nearest enclosing loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not changed by this statement, the output state will reflect that we are still within the loop and the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M`, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
