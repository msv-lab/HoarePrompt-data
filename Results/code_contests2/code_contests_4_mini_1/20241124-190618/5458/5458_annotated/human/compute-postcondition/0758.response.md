According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1, which is already satisfied in the given state. The variable `j` will start from 1 and increment up to `m`. The variable `s` does not directly affect the loop execution but may be relevant for the loop body. 

Since `i` is stated to be 1 at the start and does not relate to the loop's execution, it can remain as is. The state of `dp` also remains unchanged. 

Thus, the necessary states are:
- `m` is at least 1, which is satisfied.
- `j` is 1, which is the starting point for the loop.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is 1**
