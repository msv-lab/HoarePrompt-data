Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no operations are performed on `dp`, and the program proceeds without any changes to `dp`.***
