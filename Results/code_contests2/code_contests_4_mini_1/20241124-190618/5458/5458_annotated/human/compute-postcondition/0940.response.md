The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the rest of the current iteration in the loop where `continue` is executed. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
