The code assigns the value `1` to the element at the position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in a 3D list `dp`. Since `i` is `0`, the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. The variable `j` is at least `2`, so `j + 1` is at least `3`. The variable `k` is at least `1`. Therefore, the specific indices affected in `dp` will be `[1][j + 1][k]`, where `j + 1` is at least `3` and `k` is at least `1`.

The other variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
