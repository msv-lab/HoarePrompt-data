According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, as the range for `k` goes from 1 to `s + 1`. Since it is stated that `S` is at least 1, that condition is satisfied. The value of `j` does not impact the execution of the loop directly and can remain as is. Since `k` will start from 1, it doesn't need adjustment either.

Therefore, the necessary states for the loop to execute are:
- `S` is at least 1
- `dp` remains unchanged
- `m` is at least 2
- `j` is 2
- `k` will start at 1

State: **`S` is at least 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1**
