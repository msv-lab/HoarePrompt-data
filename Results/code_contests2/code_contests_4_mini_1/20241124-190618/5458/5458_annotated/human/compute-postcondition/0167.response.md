Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer less than `m`, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2; if `j` is greater than `k`, the program skips the modification, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
