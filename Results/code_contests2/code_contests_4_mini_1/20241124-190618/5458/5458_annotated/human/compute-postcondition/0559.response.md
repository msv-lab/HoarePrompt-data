Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` array, and the flow proceeds as per the next steps in the loop.***
