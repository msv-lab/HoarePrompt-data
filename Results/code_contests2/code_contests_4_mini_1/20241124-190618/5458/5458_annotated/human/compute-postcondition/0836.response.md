Postcondition: ***`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `1`, `k` is `1`, `j` is `2`, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program continues to the next iteration without making any changes to the `dp` array.***
