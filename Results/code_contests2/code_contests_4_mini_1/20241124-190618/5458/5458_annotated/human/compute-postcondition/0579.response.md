Postcondition: ***`S` is at least 1, `dp` is modified at index [1][3][1] to 1 since `j` (which is 2) is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1). `m` is at least 2, `j` remains 2, `k` remains 1, and `i` is equal to 0. The condition for modifying `dp` is satisfied, thus the specified value is updated accordingly.***
