The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous state shows that `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and since `k - j` would be `1 - (m + 1)`, it is important to check if this value results in a valid index. However, since `j` is greater than `k`, `k - j` results in a negative or invalid index. 

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the affected variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` because the addition is not valid. The other variables remain the same. 

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.**
