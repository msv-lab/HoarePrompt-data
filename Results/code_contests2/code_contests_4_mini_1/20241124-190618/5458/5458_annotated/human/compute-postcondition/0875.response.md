The code attempts to modify the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. However, since it is specified that no statements within the if block are executed, it implies that the code does not affect the values of `dp`, `j`, or `k`. Therefore, the variables `m`, `s`, `i`, and `dp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `dp` remains unchanged, and no statements within the if block are executed.**
