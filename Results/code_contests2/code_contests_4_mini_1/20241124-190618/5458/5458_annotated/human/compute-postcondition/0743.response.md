Postcondition: ***If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is not updated in this block. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][3][2]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is updated with the value from `dp[1][3][2]` modulo `mod` and also added to `dp[0][3][0]` modulo `mod`. In all cases, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, with `i` either remaining 0 or incrementing based on the flow of control.***
