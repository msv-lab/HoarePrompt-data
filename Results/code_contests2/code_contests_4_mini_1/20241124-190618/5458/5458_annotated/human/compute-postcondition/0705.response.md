The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead causes the program to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the current values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
