According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Thus, `k` needs to be updated to 3, while `s` remains at least 2.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, and `k` is 3**
