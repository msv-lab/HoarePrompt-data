Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 3 or 4, and `k` is at least 3. If the loop executes, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `S` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `S` remains unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged for that iteration. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on a combination of previous states. The logic ensures that all possible edge cases related to `i`, `j`, and `k` are addressed.**
