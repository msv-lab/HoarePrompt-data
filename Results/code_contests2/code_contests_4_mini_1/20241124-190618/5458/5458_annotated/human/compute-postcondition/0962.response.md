Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][j][k]`. If `j` is equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulus of `dp[1][j][k]` and `dp[0][j][k - j]`. In cases where `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp`.***
