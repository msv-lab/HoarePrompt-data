Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][j][k]`. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value. All updates to `dp` maintain the relationship defined by the original conditions and the modulo operation as specified.***
