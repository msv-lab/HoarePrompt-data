The code assigns the value `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either `1` or `0` depending on whether `i` is `0` or greater than `0`. The values of `j` and `k` are incremented and are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, if `i` is `0`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`, and if `i` is greater than `0`, then `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`.

The output state is as follows, indicating the assignment to the `dp` array based on the value of `i`:

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and `dp` is updated based on the value of `i`**
