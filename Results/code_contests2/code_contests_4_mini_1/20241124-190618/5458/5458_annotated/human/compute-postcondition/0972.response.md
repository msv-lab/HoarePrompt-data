The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly; instead, it operates based on user inputs for `N`, `M`, and `S`, which are provided under specific constraints. `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. The function continues to process inputs until all three values, `N`, `M`, and `S`, are equal to 0. 

Since the output behavior is not specified in detail in terms of return values, the functionality of the function can be described as accepting input values for `N`, `M`, and `S` under the stated constraints and terminating when all three inputs are zero.

Functionality: **The function accepts inputs for N, M, and S within specified positive integer constraints, and terminates when N, M, and S are all 0.**
