Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the body of the if statement, leaving the values of `dp` unchanged for the given indices.***
