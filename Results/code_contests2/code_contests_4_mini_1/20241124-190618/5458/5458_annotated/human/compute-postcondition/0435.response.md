According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1, which is already satisfied according to the initial state. 

However, since we are using `xrange` and the loop variable `j` starts from 1, `j` will take values from `1` to `m`. Therefore, `j` should start at `1` for the first iteration. 

The variable `i` being less than `n` does not directly affect the execution of the loop since the loop does not use `i`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are that `j` is initialized to `1`.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1**
