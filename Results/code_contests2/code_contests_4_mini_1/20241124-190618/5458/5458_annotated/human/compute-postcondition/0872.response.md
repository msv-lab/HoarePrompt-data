The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
