The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but rather skips the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same. 

The output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and indicates that we are continuing with the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`i` is `n^2` and is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**
