Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer less than `m` and greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged as there is no else part in the code.***
