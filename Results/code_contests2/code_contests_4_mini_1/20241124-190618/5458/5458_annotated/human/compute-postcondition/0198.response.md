The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged because the `continue` statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing in the loop without changing any variable values.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
