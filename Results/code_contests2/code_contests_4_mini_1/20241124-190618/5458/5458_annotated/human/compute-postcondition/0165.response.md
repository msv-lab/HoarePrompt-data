Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer less than `m`, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, this condition does not apply, and the program continues without modifying the `dp` array. All conditions and relationships stated in the precondition are preserved.***
