Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is equal to 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration without any modifications.***
