The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The state of the other variables and the values of `dp` arrays are not given explicitly, but we know:

1. `i` is less than `N` and not equal to 0.
2. `j` is at least `M + 1`.
3. `k` is 1.
4. `S` and `s` are at least 1.
5. The operation involves accessing `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` which requires `k - j` to be valid and thus `j` must be less than or equal to `k`.

Since `k` is 1 and `j` is at least `M + 1`, `k - j` would be negative or invalid for the operation, leading to no change in the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M + 1`, `k` is 1, and no change occurs in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` because `k - j` is invalid.

Output State: **`i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M + 1`, `k` is 1, and no change occurs in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`**.
