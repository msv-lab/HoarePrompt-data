According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `S`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `S` is at least 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3, and S must be at least 3 to allow `k` to still be less than or equal to `S`.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 3, `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 3**
