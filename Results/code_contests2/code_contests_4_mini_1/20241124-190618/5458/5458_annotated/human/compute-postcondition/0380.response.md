Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
