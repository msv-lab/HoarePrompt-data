According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` in relation to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `S` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to at least 2, and `s` must be at least 2 to ensure that the upper limit of the loop (`s + 1`) allows for another iteration. 

Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to 2 and ensure that `s` is at least 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M`, and `k` is 2**
