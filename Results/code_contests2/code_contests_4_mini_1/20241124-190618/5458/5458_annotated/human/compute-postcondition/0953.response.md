Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is less than or equal to `s - 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes occur to the dp array. If `i` is not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is less than or equal to `s - 1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring that the dp array reflects the appropriate values based on the current indices and modular arithmetic. Care is taken to ensure that all indices remain within valid bounds relative to `s`.***
