The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific position in a 3D array `dp`. The indices for this assignment are calculated based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes the index for the first dimension of `dp`. This operation depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1, and `1 & 1` gives 1. If `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2, and `2 & 1` gives 0. Thus, `i + 1 & 1` will result in either 0 or 1 based on whether `i` is even or odd.
   
2. `j + 1` increments `j` by 1 for the second dimension of `dp`.

3. The third dimension is indexed by `k`, which is equal to 2.

Since the values of `N`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` are specified in the initial state but not given specific values, we cannot determine the exact indices or the resulting state of `dp`. However, we can state how the variables and the array `dp` are affected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is equal to 2, and `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1.**
