The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are all at least 1; `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
