According to the code, the for loop will execute for each value of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented.

Since `k` is currently less than or equal to `s`, to allow the loop to execute again, `k` should be set to the next integer, which would be `k + 1`. Additionally, since the loop starts at 1, if `k` is currently equal to `s`, the loop will not execute again because it will exceed `s`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `k` needs to be incremented to `k + 1`, and we need to ensure that `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`i` is 0 or incremented, `j` is unchanged, `k` is less than or equal to `s - 1`**
