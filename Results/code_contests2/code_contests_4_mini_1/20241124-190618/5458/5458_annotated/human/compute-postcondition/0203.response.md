According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to the next integer. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to 3.

Additionally, since the loop condition is that `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and we know that `s` is at least 2, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 3**
