According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the condition `n`. The loop is designed to iterate `n ** 2` times, which means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. If `i` is currently 0, it will still be less than `n ** 2` as long as `n` is at least 1. If `i` is greater than 0, it needs to be adjusted to be less than `n ** 2`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `N`, `M`, `S`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by the loop execution conditions.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is less than `n ** 2`, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least `M`, `k` is at least `S`**
