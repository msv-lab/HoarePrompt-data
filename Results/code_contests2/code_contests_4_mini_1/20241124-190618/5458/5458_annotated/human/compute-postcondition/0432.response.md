To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop conditions and state variables.

1. The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `1` to `M + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is either `3` or `4`. Since `M` is at least `3`, if `j` is `4`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, if `j` is `4`, we need to adjust it to `5` for the loop to execute one more time, which is out of the current range for `j`. 

2. If `j` is `3`, then the loop can execute again as long as `M` is at least `3`. In this case, we need to ensure that `j` is incremented to `4` for the next iteration.

3. The values of `N`, `S`, `i`, and `k` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute again, given that `M` is at least `3` and `j` is the primary variable controlling the loop iteration.

Based on this analysis, if `j` is `4`, the loop can't execute again, but if `j` is `3`, it can. 

If we assume `j` is `4`, we need to adjust `M` so that it allows `j` to iterate properly. If `j` is `3`, we can just increment `j` for the next iteration. 

Therefore, the main adjustments depend on the possible values of `j`. Since `j` can only be `3` or `4`, we will assume the worst-case scenario where `j` is `4` and needs to be adjusted.

### Conclusion
State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 4, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 4, and `k` is at least 3.**
