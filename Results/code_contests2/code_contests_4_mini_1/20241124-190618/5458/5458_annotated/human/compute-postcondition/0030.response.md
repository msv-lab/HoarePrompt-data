According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, it can accommodate this increment. 

Thus, the only states that need to be adjusted are `k`, which should now be 3. The values of `N`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `s` do not need to be changed because they are not impacted by the execution of the loop in this context.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1.**
