Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop, leaving the state of `dp` unchanged for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` as it takes the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made and the program continues to the next iteration as well. Thus, the specific state of `dp` may depend on the previous values of `j` and `i`, but the overall conditions of `m`, `s`, `i`, and `k` remain intact.***
