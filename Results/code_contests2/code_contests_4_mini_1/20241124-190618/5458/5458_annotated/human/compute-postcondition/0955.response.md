The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a 3D list or array named `dp`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to determine the indices for this assignment. 

- `i` is currently 0, so `i + 1` becomes 1. The bitwise AND operation `1 & 1` results in `1`.
- `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and since `k` is equal to `s`, we don't have specific values for `j` and `k`, but we can denote them as `j` and `k` respectively.
- The assignment sets `dp[1][j + 1][k]` to `1`.

Since the values of `j` and `k` are not specified beyond their relationships, we cannot determine specific values for them, but we acknowledge that the state of `dp` has been changed.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
