The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
