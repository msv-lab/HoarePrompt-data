Postcondition: ***If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions: if `j` is greater than `k`, it takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, otherwise it adds the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` after applying modulus `mod`. The values of `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged throughout the execution. The potential edge case where `j` equals `k` is also considered within the conditions.***
