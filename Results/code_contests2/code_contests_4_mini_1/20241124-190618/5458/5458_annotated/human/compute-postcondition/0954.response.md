According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` can take on the next value within the range defined by `xrange(1, s + 1)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s - 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be equal to `s`. This means that `k` will now take on the value at the upper bound of the loop range. 

The other variables (`i` and `j`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not directly affected by the current state of `k` for the next loop iteration.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is equal to `s`**
