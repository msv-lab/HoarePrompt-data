Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is greater than 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues; otherwise, no changes are made.***
