According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `m`. The loop iterates over `j` starting from 1 and going up to `m`. Given that `j` will take values from 1 to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 2. Since we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we also need to adjust `j` to the next value, which would be `j` equal to `2` for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was at least `1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented to `2` and `m` must be at least `2`.

State: **If S is at least 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
