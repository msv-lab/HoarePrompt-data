The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the execution continues with the next iteration of the loop that `continue` is inside. Therefore, no variables are modified.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, and `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
