The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that no variables have changed, but we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
