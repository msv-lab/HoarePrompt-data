The code assigns the value `1` to the array `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `i` is currently `0`, so `i + 1` becomes `1`. The `& 1` operation will result in `1`, since `1 & 1` equals `1`. 

Next, `j` is at least `1`, so `j + 1` is at least `2`. The value of `k` remains `1`. 

Therefore, the output state will be: `N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned a value of 1.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned a value of 1.**
