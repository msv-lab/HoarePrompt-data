According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute from 1 to `s`, so for the loop to run, `s` must be at least 1. The loop index `k` will start at 1 and will iterate up to `s`. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute:
- `s` must be at least 1 to ensure the loop runs at least once.
- `k` starts at 1 (the first iteration of the loop).

State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
