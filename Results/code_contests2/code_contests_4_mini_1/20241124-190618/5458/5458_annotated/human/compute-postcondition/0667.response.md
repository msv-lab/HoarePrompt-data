According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 1, and `s` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

As `k` is at least 1 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be updated to 2 (as it will be incremented), and `s` must be adjusted to be at least 2 to ensure the loop can continue executing.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 2.**
