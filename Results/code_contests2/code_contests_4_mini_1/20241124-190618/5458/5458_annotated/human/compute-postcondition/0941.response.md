Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, and `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and skips to the next iteration of the innermost loop. There are no modifications to the values of `m`, `s`, `i`, `k`, or `j` in this case. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program would not execute the code within the if statement, leaving the state unchanged.***
