Postcondition: ***`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `2`, `k` is `2`, and `j` is `2`. If `i` is `0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` or `dp[0][3][2]` is set to 1 based on the value of `i`. If `i` is not `0` and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated using `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with both updates modulo `mod`. The values of `j`, `k`, and other variables remain unchanged throughout.***
