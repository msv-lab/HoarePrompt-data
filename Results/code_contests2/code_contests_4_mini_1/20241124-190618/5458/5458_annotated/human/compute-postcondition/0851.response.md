Postcondition: ***`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `2`, `k` is `2`, `j` is `2`, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at either the index `[1][3][2]` or `[0][3][2]` to 1, depending on the value of `i`, while the values of `j`, `k`, and other variables remain unchanged.***
