Output State: **If `i` is less than `N` and `M` is at least 1 and `S` is at least 1, the loop executes `M` times with `j` taking values from 1 to `M` and for each `j`, it executes `S` times with `k` taking values from 1 to `S`. After the loop executes, `N`, `M`, and `S` remain at least 1, `i` is less than `N`, and `j` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for each applicable `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j < k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the defined relationships. If `M` is less than 1, or `S` is less than 1, or `i` is not less than `N`, the loop does not execute at all, leaving `dp` unchanged. In those cases, `N`, `M`, and `S` remain at least 1, `i` remains less than `N`, and `j` remains at least 1.**
