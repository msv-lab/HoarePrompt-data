The code `continue` causes the program to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and jump to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables without any modifications.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
