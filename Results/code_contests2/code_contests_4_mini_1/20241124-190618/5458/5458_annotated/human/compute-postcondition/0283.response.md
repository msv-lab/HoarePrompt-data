According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the variable `s`. The loop iterates `k` from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` when it starts its next iteration. 

Given that `k` is currently 3, in order for the loop to execute again, `k` should be adjusted to 4 for the next iteration. Since `s` is at least 3, it is valid for `k` to be 4 because `s` could be equal to or greater than 4.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3**
