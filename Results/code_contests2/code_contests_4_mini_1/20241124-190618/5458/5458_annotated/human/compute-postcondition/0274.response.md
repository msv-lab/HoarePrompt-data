According to the code, the loop will execute while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 1 and `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, `s` must be at least 3 to ensure that `k` remains within the bounds of the loop condition. 

Thus, we need to adjust `s` to be at least 3. 

State: **`s` is at least 3, `k` is 3**
