Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program proceeds to the next step without any modifications to `dp`.***
