The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `j` and `k` are both at least 3, which means `j + 1` will be at least 4. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Output State: **`S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
