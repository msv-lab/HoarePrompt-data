Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are all at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` array in this block.***
