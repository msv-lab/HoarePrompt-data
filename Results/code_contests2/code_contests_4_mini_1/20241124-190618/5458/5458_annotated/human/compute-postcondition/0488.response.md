Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no updates are made, and the current iteration continues without any changes.***
