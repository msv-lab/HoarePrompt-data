Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is an integer equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In the case where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures all possible transitions of `dp` are considered based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
