Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is either 0 or greater than 0; `m` is a positive integer; `s` is a positive integer. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is 0, for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as a sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The loop will execute `s` times if `s` is at least 1. If `m` is less than 1, the outer loop does not execute, and `j` remains undefined. If `m` is 0 or less, the outer loop will not execute and `dp` remains unchanged.**
