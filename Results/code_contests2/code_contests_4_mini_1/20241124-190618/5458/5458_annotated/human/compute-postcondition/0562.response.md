Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` plus the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This ensures that all possible relationships and updates of the `dp` array are covered based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
