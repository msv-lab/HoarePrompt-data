According to the code, the loop will execute for `j` from 1 to `m`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions that allow it to run. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `i` is less than `N`
- `j` is at least `M`
- `S` is at least 1

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be incremented. Since the loop iterates from `1` to `m + 1`, the current maximum value of `j` should be less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, if `j` is already at its maximum limit, we need to adjust `m` to allow for an additional iteration, and `j` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, if `j` is currently `M`, we would need to adjust it to `M + 1`, and `m` needs to be at least `M + 1` to allow this new value of `j`.

State: **`i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M + 1`, `S` is at least 1, `m` is at least `M + 1`**
