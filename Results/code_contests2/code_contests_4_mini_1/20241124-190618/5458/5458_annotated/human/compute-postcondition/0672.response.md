Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the nearest loop, while the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state as there is no else part.***
