Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, where the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no change to the state of the program.***
