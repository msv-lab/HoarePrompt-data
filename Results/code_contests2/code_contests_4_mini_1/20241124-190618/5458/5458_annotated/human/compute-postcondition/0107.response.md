According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `s`. Specifically, the loop will continue to run while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4, and `s` must be at least 4 to ensure that the loop condition `k ≤ s` holds true.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 4; `k` is 4**
