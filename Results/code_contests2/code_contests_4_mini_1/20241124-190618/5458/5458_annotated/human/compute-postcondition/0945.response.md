To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions given:

1. The loop iterates over `k` in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. 
2. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.
3. The current state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Since `k` is not explicitly mentioned, we need to assume its current value.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `k` so that it is within the bounds of the loop's range. The next value of `k` would be `k + 1`.

Thus, we need to take into account the following:
- The current value of `k` must be less than `s` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, we can deduce that `s` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`.

In summary, the states we need to adjust are:
- `k` should be incremented by 1, which means if it was `k`, we now say it is `k + 1`.
- Additionally, since `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, we can keep `j` unchanged in our new state as it satisfies the conditions.

So, the adjusted state should reflect that `k` is now `k + 1` and that `s` must be at least `k + 1`.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is less than or equal to `s` - 1**
