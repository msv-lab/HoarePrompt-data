The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its current iteration and move on to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged; thus, the output state reflects that there has been no modification to the variables.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
