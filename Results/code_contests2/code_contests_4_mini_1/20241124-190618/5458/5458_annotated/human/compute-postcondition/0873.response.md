Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `dp` remains unchanged, and if `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1), the program assigns `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute any statements within the if block.***
