The line of code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are involved in this assignment, but since their specific values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact states of `dp`. However, we know that `j` is greater than `k`, and we can infer that the assignment does not change the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `j`, or `k`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the impact of this assignment and the known conditions.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
