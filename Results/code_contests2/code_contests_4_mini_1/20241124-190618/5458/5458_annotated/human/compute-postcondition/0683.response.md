The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` indicates that we are modifying a multi-dimensional array `dp` based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Here, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 3.

- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1` (since `0 + 1 = 1`, and `1 & 1 = 1`).
- `j + 1` will be at least `2` (since `j` is at least `1`).
- `k` remains `3`.

Thus, we are modifying the element `dp[1][j + 1][3]`. 

To compute the right-hand side, we need to evaluate `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. Here `i & 1` evaluates to `0`, so we are looking at `dp[0][j][k - j]`. Since `k` is `3`, `k - j` will be at least `2` (because `j` is at least `1`).

The impact of this operation is to update `dp[1][j + 1][3]` by adding the value of `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`.

The state of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remains unchanged, but `dp` is modified based on this calculation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is updated by adding `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`.**
