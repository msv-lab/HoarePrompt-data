To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the current state and the conditions for the loop to run.

1. The loop will execute for `j` ranging from 1 to `m`. 
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is currently at least 1 (as stated), and `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
3. For the loop to execute again, the value of `j` needs to be incremented to the next value, which means `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`.

Given that the current value of `j` is at least 1, the adjustment we need to make depends on ensuring that `j + 1` is still within the bounds of `m`. 

Since `j` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, we can assume that `m` is at least 2 (since if `m` were 1, the loop would not execute again after the first iteration). Therefore:

- The current value of `j` needs to be incremented to `j + 1` for the loop to run again.
- We also need to ensure that `m` is adjusted to be at least `j + 1` (which will be at least 2).

Thus, the adjusted states would be:
- `j` becomes 2 (if it was 1), 
- `m` needs to be at least 2 (to allow `j` to be 2).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1.**
