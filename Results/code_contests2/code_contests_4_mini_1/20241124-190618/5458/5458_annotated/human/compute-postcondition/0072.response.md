Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` == 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
