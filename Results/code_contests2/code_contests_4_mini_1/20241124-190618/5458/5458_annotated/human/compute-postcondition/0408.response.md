Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made, and the loop proceeds accordingly.***
