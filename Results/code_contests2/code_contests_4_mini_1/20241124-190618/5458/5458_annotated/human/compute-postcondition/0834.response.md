The operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value from one index of the `dp` array to another. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are involved in determining the indices.

Given that `i` is not equal to 0, `i + 1 & 1` will depend on the parity of `i`. If `i` is odd, then `i + 1 & 1` will be `0`, and if `i` is even, `i + 1 & 1` will be `1`.

The value `j` is `2`, and when incremented by `1`, `j + 1` becomes `3`. The value of `k` is `1` and remains unchanged.

Since `dp` is being accessed as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, we can summarize the impacts:

- The left side `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` accesses the `dp` array at indices determined by the parity of `i`, `3`, and `1`, respectively.
- The right side `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` also accesses the `dp` array at indices determined by the parity of `i`, `2`, and `1`, respectively.

Thus, after performing this operation, we have not changed the values of `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, or `i`. The state of the variables remains the same, but we have updated the `dp` array based on the values at the specified indices.

Output State: **`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `1`, `k` is `1`, `j` is `2`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
