Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the current loop iteration is skipped. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program continues without modifying `dp`.***
