The `continue` statement does not change the values of `s`, `m`, `j`, `k`, or `i`. It simply skips the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] and we continue to the next iteration.**
