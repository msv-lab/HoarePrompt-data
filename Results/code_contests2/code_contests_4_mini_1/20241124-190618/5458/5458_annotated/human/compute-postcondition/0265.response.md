According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop is defined to iterate from `1` to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2, and we must ensure that `k` does not exceed `s`. Since `s` is at least 1, it can accommodate `k` being 2 for the next iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `k` is now 2 for the next iteration, while the other states remain unchanged.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2**
