The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop. The values of `S`, `m`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the operation on `dp` cannot be determined because the value of `i` is still undefined. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and we are skipping the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`S` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and we are skipping the current iteration of the loop.**
