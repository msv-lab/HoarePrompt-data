Output State: **If `s` is at least 1, the loop executes `s` times. After the loop, `N`, `M`, and `S` are at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, and `j` is at least 2. The variable `k` will take values from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 for each valid `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.**
