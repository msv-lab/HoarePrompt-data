The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `m`, `s`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged, and no variable is returned or modified. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
