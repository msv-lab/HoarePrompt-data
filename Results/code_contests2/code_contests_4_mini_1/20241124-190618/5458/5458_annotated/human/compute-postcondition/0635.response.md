The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3] is set to dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
