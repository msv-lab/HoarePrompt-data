Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, both taken modulo `mod`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `s` is 1 and `j` is less than 2, the loop will also not execute, keeping `dp` in its initial state.**
