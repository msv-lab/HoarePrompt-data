The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n^2`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
