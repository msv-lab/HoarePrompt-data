According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is either 3 or 4, and `S` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted to 4 (if it was 3 before) or remain at 4 (if it was already 4). Additionally, `S` must be adjusted to be at least 4 to ensure the loop can continue executing.

Since `k` must be less than or equal to `S`, and given that `S` is currently at least 3, it needs to be at least 4 for the next iteration. Thus, `S` should be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 3 or 4, and `k` is 4**
