Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is made equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. There are no changes made to the state of the variables if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
