Output State: **If `s` is at least 1, the loop executes `s` times, with `k` taking values from 1 to `s`. After the loop executes, `N`, `M`, and `S` remain at least 1, `i` is less than `N`, and `j` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for each applicable `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute at all, leaving `dp` unchanged.**
