The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but will skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state reflects that no variable values have changed, but we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
