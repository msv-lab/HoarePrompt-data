The variable `mod` is assigned the value `100000`. The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `N`, `M`, and `S`, along with the new value of `mod`.

Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, M is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, S is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000**
