The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It causes the program to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there are no other values modified or returned, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned to `dp[1][3][3]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
