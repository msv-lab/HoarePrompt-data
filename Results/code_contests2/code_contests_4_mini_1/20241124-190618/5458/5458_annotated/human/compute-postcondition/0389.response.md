Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the array `dp` is updated at the position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`.***
