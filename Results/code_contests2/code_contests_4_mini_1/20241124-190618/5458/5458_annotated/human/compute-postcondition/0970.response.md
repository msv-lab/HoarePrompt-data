In the case of the `while 1` loop, the condition means that the loop will always execute indefinitely. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for any of the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, or `dp` to ensure that the loop executes again.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged; `dp` is updated according to the loop conditions, and the printed value is `dp[0][m + 1][s] % mod` if `n` is at least 1, otherwise, it is `dp[0][m + 1][s] % mod` with `dp` remaining a 2D list of zeros.**
