Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is equal to `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` array during this iteration.***
