Postcondition: ***`S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding the modulus of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. This ensures that the updates to `dp` properly reflect the conditions based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
