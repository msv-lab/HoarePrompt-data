Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. In the else part, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, which takes into account the cases where `j` is equal to or less than `k`. Therefore, the modifications to the `dp` array are contingent upon the relationships between `j` and `k`, while retaining the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `k` as specified.***
