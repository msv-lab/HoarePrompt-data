The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` indicates that we are accessing a two-dimensional list (or array) named `dp`. The indices used are derived from the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. **Index Calculation**:
   - `i + 1 & 1`: This operation will yield either `0` or `1`, depending on the value of `i`. If `i` is `0`, `i + 1` equals `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`. If `i` is greater than `0`, `i + 1` will be at least `2`, and `2 & 1` results in `0`. Thus, the first index can be `0` or `1`.
   - `j + 1`: Since `j` is at least `2`, `j + 1` will be at least `3`.
   - `k`: `k` is `3` as given.

2. **Assignment**:
   The assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` means we are setting the value at the specified indices in the `dp` list. The value being assigned comes from another index in the same list.

3. **Value Impact**:
   The state of `dp` at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to the value that exists at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This operation does not affect any other variables.

Given these observations, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the modification made to the `dp` array.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
