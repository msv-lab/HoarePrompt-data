Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the if statement and proceeds with the next logic following the if block.***
