The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged with respect to the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is equal to 3, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
