According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, and `k` equals `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to the next integer, which is `s + 1`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `k` must be changed to `s + 1` to allow the loop to execute again.

The other states (`m` and `s`) do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration since they meet the required conditions.

State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` equals `s + 1`**
