Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are at least 1, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds as per the next loop iteration without executing the if block.***
