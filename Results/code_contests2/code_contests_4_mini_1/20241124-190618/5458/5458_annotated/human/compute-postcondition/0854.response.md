Postcondition: ***`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `2`, `k` is `2`, and `j` is `2`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute the block and continues with its next steps.***
