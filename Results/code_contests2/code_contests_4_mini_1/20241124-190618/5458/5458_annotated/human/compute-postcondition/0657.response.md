The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional list or array `dp`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates the value of `i + 1` and performs a bitwise AND operation with `1`. Since `i` is `0`, `i + 1` equals `1`, and `1 & 1` equals `1`. Therefore, it effectively accesses `dp[1][j + 1][k]`.

Now, `j` is at least `1`, so `j + 1` will be at least `2`, and `k` is `1`. The code assigns the value `1` to `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. Other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged. 

The output state includes the unchanged state of the variables and the modification of the `dp` array.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
