According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The current state indicates that `k` is at least 3, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` (since the loop will stop when `k` exceeds `s`). 

Since `k` is currently 3 and `s` is at least 2, in order for the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased to the next value, which would be 4. However, we must also ensure that `s` is at least 4 to allow this new value of `k` to be valid in the loop's range. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `s` is now at least 4.

State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, and `j` is at least 2**
