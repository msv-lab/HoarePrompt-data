The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` uses the bitwise AND operator, which will evaluate to either `0` or `1` based on the value of `i`. Given that `i` is either `0` or greater than `0`, we can determine the specific index for `dp`:

- If `i` is `0`, then `i + 1 & 1` results in `1`, so the index becomes `1`.
- If `i` is greater than `0`, then `i + 1 & 1` results in `0`, so the index becomes `0`.

The values of `j` and `k` remain unaffected in this operation, but `j` is incremented by `1` in the assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the potential values of `i` and the updates to `j`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, and `k` is 3**
