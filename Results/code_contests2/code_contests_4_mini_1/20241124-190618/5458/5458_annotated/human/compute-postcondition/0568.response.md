Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 3, `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there are no changes made to the `dp` array in this code block.***
