Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, specifically `dp[1][3][1] = 1`. There are no actions taken if `j` is less than `k`, as there is no else part in the code.***
