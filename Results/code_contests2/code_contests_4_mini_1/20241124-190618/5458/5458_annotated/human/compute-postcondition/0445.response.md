Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute the if block and proceeds with the next statements outside of this if condition.***
