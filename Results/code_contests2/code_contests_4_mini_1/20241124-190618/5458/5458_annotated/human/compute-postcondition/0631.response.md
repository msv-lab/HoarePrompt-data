According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `S` is at least 1, which means that `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, `s` must be adjusted to at least 3, and `k` should be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
