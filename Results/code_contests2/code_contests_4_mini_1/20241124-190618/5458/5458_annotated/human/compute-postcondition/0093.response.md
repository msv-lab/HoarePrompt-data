The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there are no changes to the values of any variables in this case, the output state remains unchanged. The values of the variables `N`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and the assignment of `dp[1][4][2]` are unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2; and `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][2]`**
