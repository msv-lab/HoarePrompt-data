The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M + 1`, `S` is at least 1, `m` is at least `M + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and the loop continues to the next iteration without making any changes to the variable states.

Output State: **`i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M + 1`, `S` is at least 1, `m` is at least `M + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
