Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 3, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and when `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. There are no changes to the values if `j` is less than `k`, and all other variables remain unchanged.***
