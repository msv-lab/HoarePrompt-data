Postcondition: ***`S` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, indicating that the condition for the update was satisfied. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the else part does not apply as there is no else block in the code. Thus, after execution of the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to reflect the condition checked.***
