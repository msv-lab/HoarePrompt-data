Postcondition: ***`S` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without modifying the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. There are no changes to `j`, `m`, or `k` in this case. No action is taken if `j` is not greater than `k`, as there is no else part.***
