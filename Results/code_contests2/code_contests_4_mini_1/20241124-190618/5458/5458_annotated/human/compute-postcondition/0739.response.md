The code `continue` doesn't change any variable values but instructs the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][2]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
