According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented to 3.

Since `s` is greater than or equal to 2, it can accommodate the next value of `k`. 

State: **`i` is `n^2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3**
