Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are at least 1, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, provided `j` is greater than `k`. In cases where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the update to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will not include the increment from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
