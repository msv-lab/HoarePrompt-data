Postcondition: ***Given that `s` is at least 2, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is 2, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, resulting in no changes to `dp` if `j` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, effectively updating the `dp` structure while considering the modulus operation.***
