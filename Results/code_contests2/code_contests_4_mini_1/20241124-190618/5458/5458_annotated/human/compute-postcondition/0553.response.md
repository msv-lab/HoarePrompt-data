Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are at least 1, `i`, `j`, `k` are at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by copying `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0, `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding the modulus of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The state of the `dp` array is updated based on these conditions.***
