According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `i`, which will range from 0 to `n^2 - 1`. The value of `n` is given as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, meaning `n` will also be at least 1 and at most 7. Therefore, `n^2` will range from 1 to 49. 

For the loop to start executing, `i` should be initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `N` is still a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7).
- The variable `i` needs to be set to 0 to indicate the starting index of the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0**
