Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][4][2]` is updated based on the value of `dp[1][3][2] % mod`, and `dp[1][4][2]` is additionally updated based on `dp[0][3][0] % mod`, where `k - j` is taken into consideration. All operations are performed under the constraints of the initial variable states.***
