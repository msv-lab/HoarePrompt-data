In this scenario, we need to analyze the loop and the state variables provided.

The loop iterates over `k` with the statement `for k in xrange(1, s + 1):`. This means `k` will take values starting from 1 up to and including `s`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7
- `i` is either 0 or greater than 0
- `m` is greater than or equal to 2
- `j` is 2
- `s` is greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is 1

Since `k` starts from 1 and goes up to `s`, we need to check the value of `k` after the last iteration. If `k` is currently 1, then it has executed once, and now it needs to be adjusted to 2 for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2. Additionally, since the loop iterates while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute again because `k` will now be 2.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state variables are:
- `k` should be adjusted to 2.
- `s` should be adjusted to ensure it is at least 2.

Therefore, the modified state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2.**
