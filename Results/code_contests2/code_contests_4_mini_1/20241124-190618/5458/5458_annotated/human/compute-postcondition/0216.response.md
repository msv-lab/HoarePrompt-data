According to the code, the outer loop executes based on the variable `i`, which ranges from 0 to `n^2 - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n^2 - 1`. 

Given that `i` is currently at its end value (which is `n^2 - 1`), it needs to be incremented to `n^2` for the loop to execute again. However, this means that the loop cannot execute again since it would exceed its defined range.

Thus, the state needs to reflect that the loop has completed all its iterations, and at the start of the next iteration, since the loop cannot execute any further, the variable `i` should be set to `n^2`. Additionally, no other variables need to be adjusted, as they are not affected by the outer loop directly.

State: **`i` is `n^2`, all other variables remain unchanged**
