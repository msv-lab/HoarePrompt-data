According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1, allowing the loop to execute again if `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- The value of `k` should be updated to 2.
- The condition regarding `s` must confirm that it is at least 2 to allow for the loop to execute again.

State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is 2**
