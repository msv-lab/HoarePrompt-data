Postcondition: ***`i` is 0 or incremented, `j` is unchanged, and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not modify `dp` and continues without any changes.***
