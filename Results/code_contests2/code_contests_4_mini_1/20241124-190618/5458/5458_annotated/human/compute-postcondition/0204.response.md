The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific element in a 3-dimensional array `dp`. The specific indices being modified are dependent on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is at least 3 (but its specific value does not affect the assignment).
- `j` is equal to `m + 1` (we do not know the value of `m`, hence `j` is unknown).
- `k` is 3 (this value is known).

The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact indices of `dp` being modified. However, we know that:
- `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either `0` or `1`, depending on whether `i` is even or odd.
- `j + 1` will be `m + 2`, which is also unknown.

Since the state of other variables remains unchanged and we are only modifying the value in the `dp` array, the output state will reflect the current known values of `s`, `j`, and `k`, along with the indication that an assignment was made.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**.
