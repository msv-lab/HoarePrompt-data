Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, and depending on the value of `i`, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures that all edge cases concerning the relationship between `j` and `k` are handled appropriately.***
