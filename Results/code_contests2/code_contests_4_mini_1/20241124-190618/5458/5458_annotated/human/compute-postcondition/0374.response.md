Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `k` are integers, with `N` at least 1, `M` at least 1, `S` at least 1, `i` greater than 0, `n` at least 1, `j` at least 2, and `k` equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program execution proceeds without any update to `dp`.***
