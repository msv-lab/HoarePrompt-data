Output State: **If `S` is at least 1, the loop executes `M * S` times, updating the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. After the loop, `N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least `M`, and `k` is at least `S`. If `S` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `M` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and all variables retain their initial values. The loop also does not execute if `i` is less than 0, which is outside the initial conditions, but it is a potential edge case to consider.**
