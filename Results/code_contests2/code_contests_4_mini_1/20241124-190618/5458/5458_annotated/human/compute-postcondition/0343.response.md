Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All updates to the `dp` array respect the modulo operation with `mod`.***
