The assignment updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` do not directly affect this assignment, but it is important to note the conditions: `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. Since `j` is greater than `k`, this assignment will copy the value from the `dp` array based on the current indices determined by `i`, `j`, and `k`.

However, without specific values for the `dp` array or the current index values for `i`, `j`, and `k`, we cannot determine the exact values that are being assigned or copied. Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k`, along with the fact that the assignment operation took place.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1; assignment operation is performed on `dp` array.**
