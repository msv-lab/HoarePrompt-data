Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula involving `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, ensuring that all updates adhere to the modulo operation with respect to `mod`.
