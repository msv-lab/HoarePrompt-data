The statement updates the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The operation depends on the value of `j`, which can be either 3 or 4. 

1. If `j` is 4, the code updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][3]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3] % mod`. 
2. If `j` is 3, no operations are performed on `dp`.

The previous states of the relevant variables are:
- `N` is at least 1,
- `M` is at least 3,
- `S` is at least 3,
- `i` is either 0 or greater than 0,
- `n` is at least 1,
- `j` is either 3 or 4,
- `k` is 3.

Since the operation modifies the `dp` array based on the current state of `i`, `j`, and `k`, and we do not have the specific values of `dp`, we cannot provide exact values for the `dp` array. Therefore, the output state reflects the operation that would occur based on the value of `j`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, `k` is 3; if `j` is 4, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][3]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3] % mod`; if `j` is 3, then no operations are performed on `dp`.**
