The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. This operation does not modify the values of `i`, `j`, or `k` directly, but it utilizes their current values for the assignment. The variable `i` can either be 0 or some incremented value, `j` remains unchanged, and `k` is less than or equal to `s`, specifically `k` is the previous value plus 1. Therefore, while the state of `dp` changes, the state of `i`, `j`, and `k` remains as they were.

Output State: **`i` is 0 or incremented, `j` is unchanged, `k` is less than or equal to `s (specifically, `k` is the previous value plus 1)**
