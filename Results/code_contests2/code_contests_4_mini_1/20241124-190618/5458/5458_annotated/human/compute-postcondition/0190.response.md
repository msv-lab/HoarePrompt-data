Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1), then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the current iteration of the enclosing loop is skipped. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the state of `dp` and the iteration continues normally. The precondition ensures valid initial values for `s`, `j`, `k`, and `i`.***
