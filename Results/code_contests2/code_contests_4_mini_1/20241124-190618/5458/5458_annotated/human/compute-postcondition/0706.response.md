Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there are no changes made to the `dp` array in this block.***
