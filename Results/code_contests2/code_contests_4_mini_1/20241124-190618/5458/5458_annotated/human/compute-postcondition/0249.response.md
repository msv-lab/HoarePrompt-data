To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. This means that the loop will execute for `k` values starting from 1 up to `s`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
   - `i` is `n^2`
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `j` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `s` is greater than or equal to 3
   - `k` is 3

3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to check if the current value of `k` (which is 3) is less than `s` (which is at least 3). Since `k` is currently equal to 3, it can only execute again if `s` is greater than 3.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The value of `k` should be incremented to 4 for the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to execute again requires that `s` must be greater than 3.

Thus, the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `s` must be greater than 3.
- `k` should be 4 for the next iteration.

Now we can summarize the state as follows:

State: **`i` is `n^2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 3, and `k` is 4**
