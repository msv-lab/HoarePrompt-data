Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, if `i` is 0, then `dp` at index `[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` at index `[1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp` at index `[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The structure of `dp` is updated accordingly based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
