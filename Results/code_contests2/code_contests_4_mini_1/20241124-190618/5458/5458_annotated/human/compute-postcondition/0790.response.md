According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` in relation to `s`. The loop iterates with `k` starting from 1 and continues until `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4. Additionally, since `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, `s` must also be at least 4 to allow for this iteration.

Thus, we need to adjust `s` to be at least 4 and `k` to be 4 to ensure the loop executes one more time.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3**
