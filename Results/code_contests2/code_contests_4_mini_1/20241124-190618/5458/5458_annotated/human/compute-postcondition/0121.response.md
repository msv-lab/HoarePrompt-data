The code `continue` does not change the state of any variables; instead, it skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains as it was before the execution of the code. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is less than `N`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
