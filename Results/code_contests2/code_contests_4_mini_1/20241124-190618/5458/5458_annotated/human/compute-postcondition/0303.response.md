The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 2, and the array `dp` is modified at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k], and we continue to the next iteration.
