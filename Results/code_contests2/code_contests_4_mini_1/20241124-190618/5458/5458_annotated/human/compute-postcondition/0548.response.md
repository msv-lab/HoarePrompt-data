The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` utilizes bitwise AND operation, which affects how the index for the first dimension of the array `dp` is calculated. 

Given that `i` is at least 1, `i + 1` will be at least 2. The bitwise operation `2 & 1` results in `0`, meaning that the first index of `dp` will be `0`. 

`j + 1` increases `j` by 1, and since `j` is greater than `k` and both are at least 1, `j + 1` will always be at least 2.

Therefore, the output state reflects the following:

- `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`, meaning this assignment does not change the values in the `dp` structure, but it sets `dp[0][j + 1][k]` to be equal to `dp[0][j][k]`.

Since the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are all at least 1 and the operation does not affect their values, the output state is:

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are all at least 1; `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`**
