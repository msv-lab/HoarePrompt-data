According to the code, the loop iterates for the variable `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to 3. Since `s` is at least 2, it allows the loop to continue as long as `k` does not exceed `s`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `k` is incremented to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted because the conditions for `N`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged and do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer less than `m`, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 3.**
