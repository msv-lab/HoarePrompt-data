Postcondition: ***`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `1`, `k` is `2`, `j` is `2`, and `i` can be either `0` or not equal to `0`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute any operation in this block and continues with the next iteration of the loop as well.***
