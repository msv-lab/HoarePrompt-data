The code contains a `continue` statement, which is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since we do not have information about any enclosing loop or the context in which this statement is executed, we cannot determine any changes to the state of the variables based on the `continue` statement itself. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `1`, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, `i` can be either `0` or not equal to `0`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
