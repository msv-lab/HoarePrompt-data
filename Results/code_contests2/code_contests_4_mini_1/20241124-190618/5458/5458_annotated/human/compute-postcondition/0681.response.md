Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds without executing the if block.***
