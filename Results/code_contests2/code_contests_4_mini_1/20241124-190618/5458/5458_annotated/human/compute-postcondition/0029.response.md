Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures that the updates to `dp` are consistent with the values of `j` and `k`, covering all possible cases based on the conditions provided.***
