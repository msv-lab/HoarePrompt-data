Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 3, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1, with no changes to those variables.***
