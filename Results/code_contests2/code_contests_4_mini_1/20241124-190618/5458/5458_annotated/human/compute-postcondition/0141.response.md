Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`; `m` is greater than 0; `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is equal to 3; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`; if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the current state remains unchanged.**
