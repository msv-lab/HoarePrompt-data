Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the state of the program is updated by setting `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop.***
