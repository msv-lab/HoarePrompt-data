According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `S`. Since `S` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The loop variable `k` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `S`. The initial conditions given ensure that `i` is less than `n` and `j` is 1, but these do not affect the execution of the current loop.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes correctly, we need to confirm that `k` is initialized at 1. Since `k` will take values from 1 to `S`, we can also note that at the end of the last iteration, `k` will be `S + 1` after the loop finishes.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
