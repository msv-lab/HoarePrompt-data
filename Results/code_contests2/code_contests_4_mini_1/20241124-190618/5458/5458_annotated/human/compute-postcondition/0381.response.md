The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multidimensional list or array `dp`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are of interest for determining how the array is accessed and updated.

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` operates on `i`. If `i` is 0, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. If `i` is greater than 0 (1 or more), then `i + 1` will be at least 2, and `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to `0` (since any even number & 1 is 0).
2. The variable `j + 1` is directly accessed, which will always be at least `3` since `j` is at least `2`.
3. The variable `k` is `2`.

With this understanding, the indices used for the `dp` array are:
- For `i = 0`: `dp[1][j + 1][2] = dp[1][j][2]`
- For `i > 0`: `dp[0][j + 1][2] = dp[0][j][2]`

The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` are not directly affected by this operation, and there are no changes to the states of those variables. The operation simply updates an entry in the `dp` array based on the current state of other entries.

Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` determine how the `dp` array is accessed and updated, the output state will reflect that the `dp` array is being updated based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `dp` is updated based on the expression.**
