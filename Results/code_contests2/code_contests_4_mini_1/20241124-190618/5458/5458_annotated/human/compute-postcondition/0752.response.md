Postcondition: ***`i` is 0 or incremented, `j` is unchanged, and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, accounting for the potential edge case when `k - j` is less than 0.***
