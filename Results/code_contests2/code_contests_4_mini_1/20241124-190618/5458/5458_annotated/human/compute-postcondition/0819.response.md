The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `m`, `s`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged, as the `continue` statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are moving to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to the variable values.

Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, `j` is at least 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
