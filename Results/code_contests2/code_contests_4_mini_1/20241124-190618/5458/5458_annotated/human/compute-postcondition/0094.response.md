Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, specifically, `dp[1][4][2]` is updated based on the value of `dp[1][3][2]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`.***
