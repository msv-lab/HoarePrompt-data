Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program continues without any modifications to `dp`.***
