The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; instead, it skips the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified, the output state remains the same. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 3, `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
