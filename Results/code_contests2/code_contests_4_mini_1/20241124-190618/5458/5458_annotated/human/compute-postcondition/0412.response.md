To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided state and loop conditions step by step.

1. The loop iterates with `k` taking values from 1 to `S` (inclusive). Given that `S` is at least 1, the loop can execute at least once.
2. The current state indicates that `k` is currently 1.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to take the next value, which would be 2.
4. Since `S` is at least 1, we need to ensure that `S` is at least 2 for the loop to run again.

Thus, the adjustments to the states to allow for one more iteration of the loop would be:
- Update `k` to 2.
- Update `S` to be at least 2.

No other states (`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `n`) need to change for the next iteration.

Putting it all together, the adjusted state will be:

State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is 2.**
