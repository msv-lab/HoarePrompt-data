According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. Since `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` would be equal to `s + 1` (the loop will terminate when `k` exceeds `s`). Since `j` is given as 2, it does not affect the loop execution. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed:
- `k` starts at 1,
- `s` must be at least 1 (which it is).

State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is 2**
