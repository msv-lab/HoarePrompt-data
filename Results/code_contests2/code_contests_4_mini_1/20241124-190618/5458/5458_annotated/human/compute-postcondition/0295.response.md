Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the control flow proceeds to the next part of the program as there is no else block.***
