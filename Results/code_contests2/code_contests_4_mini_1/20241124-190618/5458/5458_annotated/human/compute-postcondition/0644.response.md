According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n^2` times, starting with `i` at 0 and incrementing it by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, it is clear that `i` is at its maximum value for the current execution of the loop, which is `n^2 - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n^2`. Thus, `i` must be adjusted to `n^2`, which is the next value.

Since the values of `N` and `M` remain at least 1, and there is no mention of changes to `j`, we do not need to adjust them. 

State: **`i` is `n^2`, `j` is at least 1, `N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1**
