The code assigns the value `1` to the element in the `dp` array at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is at least `1`, so `i + 1` is at least `2`. The value of `j` is also at least `1`, so `j + 1` is at least `2`. The value of `k` is `3`. The operation `i + 1 & 1` results in either `0` or `1`, depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd. Since we don't know the exact value of `i`, we cannot definitively state the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` other than that it is assigned `1`. The other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 3, `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**.
