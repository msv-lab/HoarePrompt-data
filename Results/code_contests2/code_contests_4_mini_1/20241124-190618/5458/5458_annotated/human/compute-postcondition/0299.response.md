According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` can take on another value within the range defined by `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1, which means the loop can execute again if `k` can be incremented to 2. 

Since the loop starts at `k = 1` and goes up to `k = s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to 2. Additionally, since `s` is at least 1, `s` itself does not need to change.

Therefore, we adjust the state to reflect that `k` is now 2.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 2**
