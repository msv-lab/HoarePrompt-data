The block of code is not executed, which means there are no changes to the variable states. The values of the variables remain as they were initially. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `2`, `k` is `2`, `j` is `2`, and the block of code is not executed.**
