The code uses the `continue` statement, which causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables in the current state are not modified by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged aside from indicating that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
