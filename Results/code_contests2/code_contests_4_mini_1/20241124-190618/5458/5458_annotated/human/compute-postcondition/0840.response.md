According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop iterates over `k` in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `1`, and `k` is `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `2`, and it should still be less than or equal to `s + 1`. Since `s` is at least `1`, the maximum value of `k` can now be `2`, allowing the loop to continue.

State: **`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `1`, `k` is `2`, `j` is `2`, `i` can be either `0` or not equal to `0`**
