According to the code, the loop will execute if the variable `s` is at least 1, which is already satisfied as `s` is stated to be at least 1. The variable `k` will start at 1 and will increment up to `s`. 

The initial state of `k` is already set correctly to start the loop since it is from 1 to `s`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` do not influence the execution of this specific loop. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are minimal. The state of `k` is correctly set to 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1**
