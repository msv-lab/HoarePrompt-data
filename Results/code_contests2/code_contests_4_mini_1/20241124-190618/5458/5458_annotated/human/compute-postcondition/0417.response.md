Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. There is no change to the program state if `j` is not greater than `k`, as there is no else part.***
