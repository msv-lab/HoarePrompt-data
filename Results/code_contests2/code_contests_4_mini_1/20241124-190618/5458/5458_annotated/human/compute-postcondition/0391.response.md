The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the flow of control is altered. Thus, the output state is: `N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
