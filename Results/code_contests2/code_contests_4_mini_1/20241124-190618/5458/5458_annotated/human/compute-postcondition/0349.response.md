Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. There is no change to the state of the program if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, as the program does not enter the if block.***
