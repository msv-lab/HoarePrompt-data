Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there are no changes made to `dp` in this iteration.***
