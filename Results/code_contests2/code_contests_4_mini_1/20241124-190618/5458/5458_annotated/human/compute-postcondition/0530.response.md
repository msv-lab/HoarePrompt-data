The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop. Given the initial state of the variables, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop without modifying any values. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M + 1`, `S` is at least 1, `m` is at least `M + 1`, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
