The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes were made to the variable values, but we note that we are continuing with the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**
