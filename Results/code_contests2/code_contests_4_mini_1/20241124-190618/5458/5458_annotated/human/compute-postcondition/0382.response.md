The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and there is no return value or modification to the state of the program.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
