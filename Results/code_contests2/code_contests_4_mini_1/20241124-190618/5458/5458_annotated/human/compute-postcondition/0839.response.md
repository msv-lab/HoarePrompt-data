Postcondition: ***`m` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least `1`, `k` is `1`, `j` is `2`, and `i` can be either `0` or not equal to `0`. If `i` is `0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is `0` and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to the state of `dp`. If `i` is not equal to `0` and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
