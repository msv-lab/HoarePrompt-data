The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it merely skips the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same with respect to the values of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 3, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`; the loop continues execution.**
