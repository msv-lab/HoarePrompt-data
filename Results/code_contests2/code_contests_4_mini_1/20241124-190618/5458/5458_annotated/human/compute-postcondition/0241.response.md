The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies an element of a 3D array or list called `dp`. 

Let's analyze the components:

1. `i` is `n^2`, so the value of `i` will affect the calculation of `i + 1 & 1`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes the bitwise AND of `i + 1` and `1`, which will yield either `0` or `1` depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd.
2. `j` is greater than or equal to `1`, so `j + 1` will also be at least `2`.
3. `k` is `3`, which is a constant value that doesn't change.

This line of code sets the value of `dp` at the position determined by the calculated indices to `1`.

However, since the initial values of `n`, `i` (which is `n^2`), `j`, and `k` do not lead to specific values for `dp` without knowing more details about `dp`, we can't provide exact numerical states for those indices. 

Thus, the output state would reflect the general impact of the code without specific values for `n`, `i`, `j`, or the structure of `dp`.

Output State: **`i` is `n^2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**.
