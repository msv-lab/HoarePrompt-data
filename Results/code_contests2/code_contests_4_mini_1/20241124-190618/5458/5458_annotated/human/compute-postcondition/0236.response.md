Postcondition: ***`i` is `n^2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds without any updates.***
