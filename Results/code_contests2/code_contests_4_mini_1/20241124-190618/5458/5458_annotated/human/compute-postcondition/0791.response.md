Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. If the loop executes, for each `k`, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged. If `j` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged.**
