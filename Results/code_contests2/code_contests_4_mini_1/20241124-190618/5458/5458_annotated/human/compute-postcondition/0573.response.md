Output State: **If S is at least 1, the loop will execute exactly S times, incrementing k from 1 to S. The values of N and M remain at least 1 throughout. If i is 0 and j is at least k during any iteration, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be set to 1. If i is 0 and j is less than k, there will be no change to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. If i is not 0 and j is greater than k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If i is not 0 and j is less than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be updated based on the values of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. If S is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the values of dp remain unchanged.**
