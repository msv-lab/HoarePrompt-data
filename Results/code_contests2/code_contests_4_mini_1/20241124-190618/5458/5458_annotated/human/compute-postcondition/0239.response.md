Postcondition: ***`i` is `n^2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is added to it.***
