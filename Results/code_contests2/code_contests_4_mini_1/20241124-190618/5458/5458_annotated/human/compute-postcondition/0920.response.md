According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` equals `s + 1`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted back to `s`. 

Since the loop starts at `k = 1` and goes up to `s`, we need to ensure that `k` is within this range. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to be equal to `s`, and since `s` is at least 1, this is valid.

No other states need to be adjusted as the values for `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j` do not change in the context of the loop iteration.

State: **`m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` equals `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
