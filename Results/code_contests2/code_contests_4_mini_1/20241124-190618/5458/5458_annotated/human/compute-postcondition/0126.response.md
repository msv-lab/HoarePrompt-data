According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. The loop will iterate for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and there is no mention of it being equal to 1 at the end of the last iteration, the only adjustment required is to increment `k`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `N`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is equal to 2**
