Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there is no change in the state related to `dp`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is added to it. This ensures the correct updating of the `dp` array based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
