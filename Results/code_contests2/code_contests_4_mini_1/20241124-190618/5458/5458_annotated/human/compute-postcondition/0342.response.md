The statement updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The current values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are relevant for this operation, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is influenced by the existing values in the `dp` array. Other variables (`N`, `M`, `S`, `n`) remain unchanged. 

Since `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k - j]` is being added to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, we denote that the previous state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the operation.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
