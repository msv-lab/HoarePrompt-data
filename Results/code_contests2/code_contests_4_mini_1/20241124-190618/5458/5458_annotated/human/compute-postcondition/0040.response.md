Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. The loop will execute `s` times if `s` is at least 1. After the loop execution, for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][j][k]`. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is modified using the sum of `dp[1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`. If `s` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and the values of `dp` remain unchanged.**
