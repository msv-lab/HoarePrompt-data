Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 2, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is at least `M`, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and is also incremented by the modulus of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. All modifications to `dp` respect the given bounds and conditions.***
