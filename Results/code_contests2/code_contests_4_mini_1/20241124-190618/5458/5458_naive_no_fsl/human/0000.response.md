To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation carefully.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The bingo card is an N x N grid with unique integers between 1 and M.
2. The sum of all integers in the grid must equal S.
3. Each column must be sorted in ascending order.
4. Each integer must be greater than any integer in the column to its left.
5. We need to calculate the number of valid bingo cards and return the result modulo 100000.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of ways to fill the bingo card under the constraints mentioned.

**Key variables:**
- `dp` is a 3D list that appears to track the count of ways to fill parts of the grid based on the remaining sum and the maximum number allowed.
- The loop structure iterates through each cell of the grid and each possible integer value to determine how many valid configurations can be formed.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Minimum Values**: What happens when N = 1, M = 1, S = 1? The only valid bingo card is [[1]]. The answer should be 1.
2. **Exceeding Sum**: If N = 2, M = 2, S = 5, there are no valid bingo cards since the maximum sum with unique integers from 1 to 2 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10) is less than 5. The program should return 0.
3. **Invalid Maximum**: What if N = 2, M = 3, S = 8? The maximum sum with unique integers from 1 to 3 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10) is greater than 8, which could lead to invalid configurations.
4. **Out of Range Values**: If N = 3, M = 10, S = 100, it is impossible to create a bingo card as the maximum sum achievable would be too low.

### Example Test Cases:
- For input `1 1 1`, the program should return `1`.
- For input `2 2 5`, the expected return should be `0`.
- For input `2 2 3`, the expected return should be `0` as it cannot meet the requirements.

### Implementation Issues:
In examining the code, there is a notable issue:
- The way the DP array is indexed and updated could lead to incorrect counts in some scenarios, particularly with how it handles cases where the integers exceed the sum or the maximum allowed value.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle edge cases effectively and will likely produce incorrect results for certain inputs, particularly where the grid cannot be filled under the specified constraints.

Thus, the conclusion about the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False** 

This is due to the potential failure to handle edge cases like exceeding maximum sums or invalid configurations leading to incorrect outputs.
