To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic and see if it adheres to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem states that we have `n` companies, each with a certain number of employees and their respective salaries. We can merge companies only if their maximum salaries are the same. To achieve this, we can increase salaries (but not decrease them), and our goal is to minimize the total increase across all companies.

### Analyzing the Program
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of companies and then reads each company's employee count and their salaries.
2. **Finding Maximum Salaries**: The program computes the maximum salary for each company and stores these in `arr`.
3. **Determining the Maximum Salary Overall**: It finds the highest salary among all companies (`maxval`).
4. **Calculating Total Increase**: The program computes the total increase required to make all companies' maximum salaries equal to `maxval`. The increase for each company is calculated as `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, where `arr2[i]` is the number of employees in the company.

### Potential Edge Case
Let's consider a case where we might find an issue:

**Example Input**:
```
3
2 4 3
2 2 1
3 1 1 1
```

- Maximum salaries are `4`, `2`, and `1`. The overall maximum salary (`maxval`) is `4`.
- To make all companies have a maximum salary of `4`, we need to increase:
  - Company 1: Already has a max salary of `4`, so no increase is needed.
  - Company 2: Needs an increase of `4 - 2 = 2`, and has `2` employees, so total increase is `2 * 2 = 4`.
  - Company 3: Needs an increase of `4 - 1 = 3`, and has `3` employees, so total increase is `3 * 3 = 9`.

Calculating the total increase:
- Total increase = `0 (Company 1) + 4 (Company 2) + 9 (Company 3) = 13`.

This matches the expected output from the problem description.

### Testing an Edge Case
Now, let's test a case where there might be confusion in the calculation:

**Example Input**:
```
2
1 1
1 10
```

**Expected Processing**:
- Maximum salaries are `1` and `10`. 
- `maxval` is `10`.
- Company 1 requires an increase of `10 - 1 = 9` for its single employee.
- Company 2 is already at `10`, so no increase is needed.

Total increase = `9 (Company 1) + 0 (Company 2) = 9`.

### Final Verdict
The program correctly calculates the required increases based on the maximum salaries and the number of employees in each company. After testing various potential cases, it seems to handle the inputs as per the requirements.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
