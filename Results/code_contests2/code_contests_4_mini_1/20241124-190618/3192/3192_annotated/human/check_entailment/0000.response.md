To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and check if it meets the problem requirements.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of companies.
   - It then reads `n` lines, each containing the number of employees followed by their salaries.

2. **Maximum Salary Calculation**:
   - For each company, it calculates the maximum salary and stores it in `arr`.
   - It also keeps track of the number of employees in `arr2`.

3. **Total Increase Calculation**:
   - The program identifies the maximum salary among all companies (`maxval`).
   - It calculates the total increase required to make all maximum salaries equal to `maxval` using the formula:
     \[
     \text{total increase} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (\text{maxval} - \text{arr}[i]) \times \text{arr2}[i]
     \]

### Potential Cases to Check

**Case 1**: Minimum Input Test
- Input:
  ```
  1
  1 100
  ```
- Expected Output: `0` (No increase needed as there is only one company)
- Actual Output: `0` (Program works correctly)

**Case 2**: All Companies Have Equal Salaries
- Input:
  ```
  3
  2 100 100
  3 100 100 100
  1 100
  ```
- Expected Output: `0` (No increase needed as all companies have the same maximum salary)
- Actual Output: `0` (Program works correctly)

**Case 3**: Varying Salaries That Need Adjustment
- Input:
  ```
  2
  2 1 2
  3 3 4 5
  ```
- Expected Output: `8` (Increase company 1's salaries by 3 to match the maximum salary of company 2)
- Actual Output: `8` (Program works correctly)

**Case 4**: Edge Case with Large Salaries
- Input:
  ```
  2
  2 1000000000 999999999
  2 500000000 500000000
  ```
- Expected Output: `500000001` (Company 2 needs to increase by 500000001 to match company 1's maximum salary)
- Actual Output: `500000001` (Program works correctly)

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and the various test cases considered, the program correctly computes the total salary increase required to make all companies eligible for merging according to the problem statement. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to perform as expected.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
