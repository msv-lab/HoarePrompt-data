To determine the output state, we analyze the given initial state and the code snippet provided.

1. The variable `temp` is updated based on the maximum of its previous value and the value at `arr1[j]`.
2. The value of `j` is 2, meaning we will access `arr1[2]`.
3. The condition states that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, but we need to consider the value at `arr1[2]` to compute the new value of `temp`.

Since the specific values of `temp` and `arr1` are not provided, we cannot calculate exact numeric results. However, we can describe the relationship based on the current information.

Thus, the output state reflects the relationship without specific numeric values:

Output State: **`temp` is updated based on its previous value and `arr1[2]`, where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `j` is 2**.
