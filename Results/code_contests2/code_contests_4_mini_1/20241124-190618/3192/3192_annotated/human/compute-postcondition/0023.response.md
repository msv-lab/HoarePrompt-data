According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` in relation to `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Given that `arr1` has a first element greater than 1, we can infer that `arr1[0]` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, and `arr1[0]` must remain greater than 2.

State: **`arr1` is a list of integers with the first element greater than 2, `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or 0, `j` is 2**
