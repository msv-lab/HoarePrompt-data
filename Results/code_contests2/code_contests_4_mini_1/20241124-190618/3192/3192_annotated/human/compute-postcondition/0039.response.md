According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the first element of `arr1`, which determines the range of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently 1, and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `arr1[0]` must be at least 2, and `j` should be incremented to 2.

State: **`temp` is updated based on its previous value and the value at `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 2**
