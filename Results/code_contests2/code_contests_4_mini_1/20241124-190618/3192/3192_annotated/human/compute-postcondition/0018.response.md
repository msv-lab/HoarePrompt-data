According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, but we know that `n` is some value greater than `i`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was the last value in the previous iteration, the updated state must reflect that `i` is now one greater. Additionally, `n` is not specified to change, so it remains the same.

Assuming `i` was the last value used in the previous iteration, we need to express this relation clearly. However, since we donâ€™t have the exact value of `i`, we can denote it as `i` which must be less than `n`.

State: **`arr1[0] > 1`, temp is the maximum value of `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, arr is updated to include `temp`, arr2 is updated to include `arr1[0]`, maxval is updated to the maximum value of `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `i` is less than `n`**
