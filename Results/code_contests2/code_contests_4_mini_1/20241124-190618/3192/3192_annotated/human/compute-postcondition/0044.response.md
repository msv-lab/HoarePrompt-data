The code appends the value of `arr1[0]` to `arr2`. The value of `arr1[0]` is not specified in the initial state, but `temp` remains unchanged, and the state of `arr2` is updated to include this new value. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is the maximum value among the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, and `arr2` is updated to include `arr1[0]`.

Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value among the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, and `arr2` is updated to include `arr1[0]**
