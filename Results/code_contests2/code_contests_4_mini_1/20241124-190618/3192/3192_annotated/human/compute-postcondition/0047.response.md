Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, then `arr` will contain the maximum values from the input lists after executing `n` times; `arr2` will contain the sizes of the input lists (i.e., `arr1[0]` values); `maxval` will be the maximum value found in `arr` after all iterations. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `arr` remains empty, `arr2` remains empty, and `maxval` remains 0. If any input list size (`arr1[0]`) is less than or equal to 1, then `temp` will be 0 for that iteration, and `arr` will contain 0 for that entry.**
