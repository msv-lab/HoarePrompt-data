The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The value of `j` is 2, so `arr1[j]` refers to the third element of the list `arr1` (since indexing starts from 0). The initial values of `temp`, `arr1`, and `j` will determine the new value of `temp`. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 2 and `arr1` has at least one element, we can assume `arr1[2]` is also a valid integer.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `temp`, but the exact value cannot be determined without knowing the initial value of `temp` and the actual contents of `arr1`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2**
