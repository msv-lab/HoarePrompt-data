According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2 (since `j` will increment by 1). The current value of `j` is 2, so it will need to be adjusted to 3 for the next iteration. 

Since `arr1[0]` is stated to be greater than 1, we do not have enough information to determine its exact value. However, for the loop to execute again, we can state that `arr1[0]` must be at least 4 (greater than 2). 

State: **`temp` is updated based on its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, `j` is 3**
