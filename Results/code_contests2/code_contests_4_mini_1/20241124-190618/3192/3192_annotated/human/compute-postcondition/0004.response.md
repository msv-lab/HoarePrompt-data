According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, it is guaranteed that the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `i` needs to be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 0. The states of `arr` and `arr2` being empty do not affect the execution of the loop itself, but we should note that `maxval` is set to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
