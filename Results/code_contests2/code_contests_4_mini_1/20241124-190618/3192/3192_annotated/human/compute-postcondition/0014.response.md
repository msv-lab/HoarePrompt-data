The loop iterates from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, searching for the maximum value in the `arr1` list, starting from the second element (index 1). The variable `temp` will store the maximum value found during the iterations. 

If `arr1[0]` is less than or equal to 1, the loop will not execute, and `temp` will remain 0. 

After analyzing the provided output states and considering edge cases, the following can be concluded:

1. If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the loop will execute `arr1[0] - 1` times, and `temp` will contain the maximum value found in the elements from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`.

2. If `arr1` has only one element or is empty, the loop will not execute. In this case, `temp` will remain 0.

Output State: **`if arr1[0] > 1 then temp is the maximum value of arr1 from index 1 to arr1[0] - 1; if arr1[0] <= 1 then temp is 0 and the loop does not execute.`**
