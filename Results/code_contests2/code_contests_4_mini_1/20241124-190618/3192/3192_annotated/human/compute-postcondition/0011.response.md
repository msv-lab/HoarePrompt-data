According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop starts with `j` at 1 and continues as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 2 (since `arr1` has at least 1 element and `arr1[0]` is greater than 2).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, and we need to ensure that `arr1[0]` remains greater than `j`. This means `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2 to allow `j` to be 2, thus guaranteeing the loop will execute again.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be increased to 2.
- `arr1[0]` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to run again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is compared with `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2**
