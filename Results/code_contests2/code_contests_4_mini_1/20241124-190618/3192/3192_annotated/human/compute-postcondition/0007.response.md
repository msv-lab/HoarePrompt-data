According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. In order for the loop to run, `arr1` must contain at least one element, and that element must be greater than 1 (since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to but does not include `arr1[0]`). 

Given that `arr` is an empty list and does not influence the loop execution, the key points to adjust are:

1. Ensure that `arr1` has at least one integer value.
2. Ensure that this integer value (i.e., `arr1[0]`) is greater than 1, so that the range for `j` will have at least one value to iterate over.

The state of `i` and `temp` is also relevant as they are initialized, but they do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, we can summarize the state modifications needed:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is 0**
