The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and the value of `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, we look at the second element of `arr1`. The first element of `arr1` is greater than 1, but the exact values of `arr1` are unknown. However, `arr1[j]` must be an integer and could potentially be 1 or greater depending on the structure of the list. 

If `arr1[1]` is greater than 0 (which it is likely to be, given the initial condition of the first element), `temp` will be updated to that value. If `arr1[1]` is 0 or less, `temp` remains 0. Therefore, after executing that line, the possible new value for `temp` can be either `arr1[1]` or remain 0.

The output state will be that `temp` is now either equal to `arr1[1]` (if `arr1[1]` is greater than 0) or remains 0. The other variables `arr1` and `j` are unaffected.

Output State: **`arr1` is a list of integers with the first element greater than 1, `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or 0, `j` is 1**
