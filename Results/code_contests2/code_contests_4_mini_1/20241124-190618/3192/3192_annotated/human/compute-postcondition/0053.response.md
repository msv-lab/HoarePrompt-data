According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. The condition states that `n` must be greater than `i`, thus `n` must also be adjusted to be greater than 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`arr` will contain the maximum values from the input lists, `arr2` will contain the sizes of the input lists, `maxval` will be the maximum value found in `arr`, `ans` is increased by (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i], `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
