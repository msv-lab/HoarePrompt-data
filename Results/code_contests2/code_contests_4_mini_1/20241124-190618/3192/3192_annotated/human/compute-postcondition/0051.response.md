According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1, and it must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is greater than 1.

State: **`arr` will contain the maximum values from the input lists, `arr2` will contain the sizes of the input lists, `maxval` will be the maximum value found in `arr` after all iterations, `ans` is increased by (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i], `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
