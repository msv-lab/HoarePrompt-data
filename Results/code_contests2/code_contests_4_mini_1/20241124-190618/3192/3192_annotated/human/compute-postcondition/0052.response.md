The variable `ans` is increased by the value of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. The specific previous values of `arr[i]`, `arr2[i]`, and `maxval` are not provided, but we know that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, the calculation will depend on these values. However, since the exact values are unknown, we can't determine a specific numerical output for `ans`. 

The output state reflects this dependency on the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` will contain the maximum values from the input lists, `arr2` will contain the sizes of the input lists, `maxval` will be the maximum value found in `arr`, `ans` is increased by (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i], `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`arr` will contain the maximum values from the input lists, `arr2` will contain the sizes of the input lists, `maxval` will be the maximum value found in `arr`, `ans` is increased by (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i], `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
