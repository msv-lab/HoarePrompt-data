According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its last value from the previous iteration. Since the loop starts with `j = 1` and goes up to `arr1[0] - 1`, we need to determine the value of `arr1[0]` to understand how far `j` has gone. 

If `arr1[0]` is greater than `j`, the loop can execute one more time. To allow the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is now `arr1[0] - 1` (the last valid value for `j` in the previous iteration) and ensure that `arr1[0]` is greater than this new value of `j`.

State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[j]`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr1[0]` is greater than `arr1[0] - 1`**
