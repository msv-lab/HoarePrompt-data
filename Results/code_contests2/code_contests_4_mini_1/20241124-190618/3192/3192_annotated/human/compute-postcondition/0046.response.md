According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value that is less than `n`, and since `n` is not specified, we will assume it remains unchanged. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, it should be adjusted to `k + 1`. There are no additional adjustments needed for `temp`, `arr2`, or `maxval` as they are not directly related to the loop's execution.

Thus, the state can be updated as follows:

State: **`temp` is the maximum value among the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1; arr2` is updated to include `arr1[0]; maxval` is either unchanged or updated to max(arr[i], maxval), `i` is k + 1, `n` remains unchanged**
