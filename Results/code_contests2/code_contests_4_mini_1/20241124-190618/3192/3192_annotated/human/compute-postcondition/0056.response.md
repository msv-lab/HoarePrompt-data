Output State: **`ans` is equal to the sum of (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i] for all valid indices `i` from 0 to n-1; `arr` contains the maximum values from the input lists; `arr2` contains the sizes of the input lists; `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains 0, while `arr` and `arr2` remain unchanged.**
