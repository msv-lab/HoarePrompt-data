The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The initial value of `temp` is 0, and since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (which means `arr1[j]` will also be greater than 1 for at least one valid `j`), `temp` will be updated to the value of `arr1[j]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `temp` is now assigned a value greater than 1 from `arr1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is greater than 1**
