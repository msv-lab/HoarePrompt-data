The variable `arr2` is assigned a new empty list. The initial state of other variables (`n`, `arr`, and `maxval`) is unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, and `arr2` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, and `arr2` is an empty list**
