The variable `arr` is assigned an empty list. The variable `n`, which is a positive integer from `raw_input()`, remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `n` and the new state of `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `arr` is an empty list**
