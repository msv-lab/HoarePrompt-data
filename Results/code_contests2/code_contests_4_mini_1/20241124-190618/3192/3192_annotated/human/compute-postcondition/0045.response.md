The code assigns `maxval` the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. The variable `temp` is already defined as the maximum value among the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, and `maxval` should be updated accordingly. The value of `arr[i]` is unknown, and since `maxval` is the maximum value from the previous context, it will either remain the same or be updated to a new maximum value depending on the comparison with `arr[i]`. 

However, the specific values of `arr[i]` and `maxval` are not provided, so we cannot determine the new value of `maxval`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `maxval` could be either updated or unchanged, while `temp` and `arr2` remain unaffected by this specific operation.

Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value among the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1; `arr2` is updated to include `arr1[0]; `maxval` is either unchanged or updated to max(arr[i], maxval)**
