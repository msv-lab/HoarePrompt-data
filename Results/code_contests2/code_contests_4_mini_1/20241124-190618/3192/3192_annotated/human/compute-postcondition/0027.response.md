According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the condition defined by `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` needs to be greater than 3, and `j` should be incremented to 4. 

Since it is given that `arr1` is a list of integers with the first element greater than 3, we only need to ensure that `arr1[0]` is greater than 4 for the loop to run again, and we need to adjust `j` to 4.

State: **`arr1` is a list of integers with the first element greater than 4; `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `max(arr1[1], arr1[2])`; `j` is 4; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`.**
