The variable `maxval` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of `n` as a positive integer and `arr` as an empty list remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, and `maxval` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, and `maxval` is 0**
