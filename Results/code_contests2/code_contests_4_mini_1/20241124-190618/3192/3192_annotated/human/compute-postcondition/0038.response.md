The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The variable `j` is defined as `arr1[0] - 1`, and since `arr1[0]` is greater than `arr1[0] - 1`, `j` will be a valid index for `arr1`. The previous value of `temp` is considered, but we do not have that specific value. Therefore, `temp` will be updated based on its previous value and the value of `arr1[j]`.

Given that `temp` is updated to the maximum of itself and `arr1[j]`, we can conclude that the output state is: `temp` is updated based on its previous value and the value at `arr1[j]`.

Output State: **`temp` is updated based on its previous value and the value at `arr1[j]**
