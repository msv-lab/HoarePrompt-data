The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[j]`. Since `temp` is initially 0 and `arr1[j]` is an integer from the list `arr1`, we need to determine its value based on the context. Given that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, it's likely that `arr1[j]` (where `j` is 1) is also greater than or equal to 1 (but we don't know its exact value). Therefore, the new value of `temp` will either remain 0 (if `arr1[j]` is less than or equal to 0) or take on the value of `arr1[j]` if it is greater than 0.

Since we don't have specific values for `arr1`, we state that `temp` will be updated to the maximum of its current value (0) and the value of `arr1[j]`. 

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[j]`**
