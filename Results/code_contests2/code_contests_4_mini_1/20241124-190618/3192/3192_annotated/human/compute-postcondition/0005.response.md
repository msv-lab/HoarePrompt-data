The code assigns the variable `arr1` the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input received from `raw_input()`, which reads a line of input and splits it into individual string components. The initial state indicates that `arr` is an empty list, but `arr1` will be populated based on the user input. The value of `n`, `maxval`, `arr2`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `arr1` based on the input provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `arr1` is a list of integers from input**
