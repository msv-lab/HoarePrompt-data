The `print(ans)` statement outputs the current value of `ans`. Given that `ans` is equal to the sum of (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i] for all valid indices `i` from 0 to n-1, and if `n` is 0 or less, `ans` remains 0. The values of `arr` and `arr2` remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state reflects the current value of `ans` and indicates that `arr` and `arr2` have not changed.

Output State: **`ans` is equal to the sum of (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i] for all valid indices `i` from 0 to n-1; if `n` is 0 or less, `ans` is 0, and `arr` and `arr2` remain unchanged.**
