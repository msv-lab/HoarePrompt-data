Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and reads a series of input lists where each list starts with an integer indicating its size. It calculates the maximum value from each list and stores these in an array. It then computes the maximum value from these maximums and calculates a final answer that is the sum of the differences between this maximum value and each maximum from the lists, multiplied by the sizes of the respective lists. If no input is provided (i.e., n is 0), the function will output 0. Additionally, if any input list has a size of 1 or less, the corresponding maximum will be 0 for that entry.**
