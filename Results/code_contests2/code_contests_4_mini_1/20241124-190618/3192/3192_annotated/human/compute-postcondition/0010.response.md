`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, we check the value of `arr1[1]`. Given that `arr1[0]` is greater than 2 and `arr1` contains at least one element, we can assume that `arr1[1]` exists and is a valid integer. The exact value of `arr1[1]` is not specified, but it will be compared to `temp`. 

The previous values indicate that `temp` is greater than 1, so the result will depend on whether `arr1[j]` (i.e., `arr1[1]`) is greater than or less than `temp`. However, since `arr1[1]` could be any integer and is not defined, we cannot specify the exact result after the comparison.

Thus, the output state reflects the comparison without assigning a specific value to `temp`:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is compared with `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1**
