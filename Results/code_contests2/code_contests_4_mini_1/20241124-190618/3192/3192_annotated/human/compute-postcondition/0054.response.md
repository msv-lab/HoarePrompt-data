The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, the calculation will involve the third element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[2]`) and the third element of `arr2` (i.e., `arr2[2]`). 

The values of `maxval`, `arr[2]`, and `arr2[2]` are needed to compute the new value of `ans`. The specific values of `arr` and `arr2` are not provided, but we know `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`.

The output state must reflect the updated value of `ans` based on the expression executed, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values from the input lists, `arr2` contains the sizes of the input lists, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `ans` is increased by (maxval - arr[2]) * arr2[2].**
