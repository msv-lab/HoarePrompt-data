In this code snippet, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The variable `j` is 2, so we need to check the value of `arr1[2]`. 

- If `temp` is `arr1[1]`, then `temp` will be updated to the larger of `arr1[1]` or `arr1[2]`.
- If `temp` is 0, the new value of `temp` will be the larger of 0 or `arr1[2]`.

Since the initial state specifies that `arr1` is a list of integers with the first element greater than 2, it can be concluded that both `arr1[1]` and `arr1[2]` can also be greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the possible scenarios based on the values of `temp` and `arr1[2]`.

Output State: **`arr1` is a list of integers with the first element greater than 2; `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `max(arr1[1], arr1[2])`, and `j` is 2**
