According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `arr1` and `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Since `arr1` is a list of integers and the first element is greater than 2, `arr1[0]` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must remain greater than 3.

State: **`arr1` is a list of integers with the first element greater than 3; `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `max(arr1[1], arr1[2])`, and `j` is 3**
