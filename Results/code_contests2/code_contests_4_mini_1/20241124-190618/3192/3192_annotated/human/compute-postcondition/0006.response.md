The variable `temp` is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment, and their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the new value of `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, `temp` is 0**
