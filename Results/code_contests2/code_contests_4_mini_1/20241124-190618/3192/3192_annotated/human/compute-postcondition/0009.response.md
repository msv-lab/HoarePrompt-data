According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` in relation to `arr1[0]`. The loop runs with `j` starting from 1 and goes up to (but does not include) `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `arr1[0]`. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, if the last executed value of `j` was `k`, the next value of `j` will be `k + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be at least 1 and less than `arr1[0]`, so `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `arr1[0]` needs to be greater than 2 to allow for another iteration.
- `j` should be updated to reflect the next value which would be 1 in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
