The code snippet takes input from the user, splits it into a list of integers, and assigns it to `arr1`. The previous state of `temp`, `arr2`, `maxval`, `i`, and `n` is unaffected by this line of code because it only initializes `arr1`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new initialization of `arr1` while maintaining the previous values of other variables.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum value of `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1; otherwise, `temp` is 0; `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is updated to the maximum value of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `arr1` is a list of integers from input.**
