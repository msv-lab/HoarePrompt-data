Since the initial state specifies that if `n` is at least 1, `arr` will contain maximum values from the input lists, and if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute. The provided code only assigns `0` to `ans`, which does not affect `arr`, `arr2`, or `maxval`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` will contain the maximum values from the input lists; `arr2` will contain the sizes of the input lists; `maxval` will be the maximum value found in `arr` after all iterations; `ans` is 0.**
