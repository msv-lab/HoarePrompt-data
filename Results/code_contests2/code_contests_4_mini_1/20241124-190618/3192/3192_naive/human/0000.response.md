To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We need to merge companies based on their maximum salaries.
2. Merging is only allowed if the maximum salaries of the two companies are equal.
3. The owners can only increase salaries, and all employees in one company must receive the same increase.
4. We need to output the minimal total increase of all employees that allows merging all companies into one.

### Program Analysis:
The given program does the following:
1. It reads the number of companies (`n`).
2. For each company, it reads the salaries and calculates the maximum salary.
3. It stores the maximum salaries in `arr` and the number of employees in `arr2`.
4. It calculates the total increase required to make all maximum salaries equal to the highest maximum salary across all companies (`maxval`).
5. The total increase is computed as `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each company, summing these values up.

### Potential Cases:
1. **Single Company Case**: If there's only one company, the increase should be `0` because no merging is needed. The program should return `0` for this input.
   
   Input:
   ```
   1
   3 1 2 3
   ```
   Expected Output: `0`
   Actual Output: The program would output `0`, which is correct.

2. **Multiple Companies with Variable Maximum Salaries**: 
   
   Input:
   ```
   3
   2 4 3
   2 2 1
   3 1 1 1
   ```
   Expected Output: `13` (as provided in the example).
   Actual Output: The program correctly calculates the total increase.

3. **All Companies with the Same Maximum Salary**:
   
   Input:
   ```
   2
   3 5 5 5
   2 5 5
   ```
   Expected Output: `0` (no increase needed).
   Actual Output: The program would output `0`, which is correct.

4. **Companies with Maximum Salaries Already at Maximum Value**:
   
   Input:
   ```
   4
   1 1000000000
   3 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
   2 1000000000 1000000000
   1 1000000000
   ```
   Expected Output: `0` (no increase needed).
   Actual Output: The program would output `0`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program handles various cases correctly, including edge cases like having only one company or all maximum salaries being equal. It adheres to the problem's requirements and doesn't miss any potential cases based on the analysis.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

The reasoning is that it correctly calculates the total increase needed to ensure all companies can be merged based on their maximum salaries, all while following the constraints outlined in the problem description.
