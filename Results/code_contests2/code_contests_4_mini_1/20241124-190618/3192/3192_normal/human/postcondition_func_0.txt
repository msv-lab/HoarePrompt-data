The function accepts input from the user that specifies a number of lists, each containing integers. It calculates the maximum integer from each list, stores these maximum values, and computes a total based on the differences between the maximum value among all lists and each individual maximum, multiplied by the size of the corresponding list. If no lists are provided (n = 0), the function will output 0. The function does not handle invalid input cases, such as non-integer values or errors during input reading.
