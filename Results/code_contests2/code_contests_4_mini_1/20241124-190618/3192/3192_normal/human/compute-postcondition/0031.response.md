To determine the output state, we evaluate the impact of the code snippet on the program based on the initial state.

1. The code `maxval = max(arr[i], maxval)` assigns the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval` to `maxval`.
2. The initial state indicates that `temp` is defined based on the values of `arr1`, and `arr2` has `arr1[0]` appended to it. However, the exact values of `arr` and `maxval` are not provided in the initial state.
3. Without specific values for `arr`, we cannot determine the exact result of `max(arr[i], maxval)`, but we know that `maxval` will be updated based on the maximum value between `arr[i]` and its previous value.

Therefore, since the specific values of `arr`, `maxval`, and `i` are not defined in the initial state, the output can only reflect the operation performed.

Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value of `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, otherwise `temp` is 0 if `arr1[0]` is 1 or less; `arr2` has `arr1[0]` appended to it; `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and its previous value.**
