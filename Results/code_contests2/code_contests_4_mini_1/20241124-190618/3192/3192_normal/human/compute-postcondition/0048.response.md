The variable `ans` is assigned the value 0, but it does not affect any of the other variables (`arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`) since it is simply initialized. The states of the other variables remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` contains the maximum values found in each of the input lists (if any), `arr2` contains the sizes of each corresponding input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr`, and `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values found in each of the input lists (if any), `arr2` contains the sizes of each corresponding input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr`, and `ans` is 0**.
