The code assigns `maxval` the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`. The previous values of `arr` and `maxval` are not specified, so I cannot determine the exact values after execution. Therefore, the output state indicates that `maxval` is updated based on the maximum of `arr[i]` and the existing `maxval`.

Output State: **`maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`**
