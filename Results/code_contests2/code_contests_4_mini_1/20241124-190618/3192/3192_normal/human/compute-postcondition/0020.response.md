The variable `temp` is initialized to 0. The values of `maxval`, `i`, and `arr1` are not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the output state is `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[n-1]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr1` is a list of integers from user input, and `temp` is 0.

Output State: **`maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[n-1]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr1` is a list of integers from user input, and `temp` is 0**
