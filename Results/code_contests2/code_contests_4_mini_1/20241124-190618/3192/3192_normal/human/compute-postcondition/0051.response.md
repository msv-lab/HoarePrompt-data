According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now 1. Since `n` is already greater than 0, this condition remains unchanged.

State: **`arr` contains the maximum values found in each of the input lists, `arr2` contains the sizes of each corresponding input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
