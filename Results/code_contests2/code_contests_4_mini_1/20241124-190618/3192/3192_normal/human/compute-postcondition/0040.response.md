The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 2, `arr1[j]` refers to `arr1[2]`. Given that `arr1[0]` is at least 2, we do not have information about the values of `arr1[1]` and `arr1[2]`. Therefore, `temp` could remain the same or be updated to a value depending on `arr1[2]`. The output state indicates that `temp` is affected by the operation, but its new value cannot be determined without knowing `arr1[2]`. Thus, the output state reflects that `temp` is updated based on the maximum comparison.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[2]), `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
