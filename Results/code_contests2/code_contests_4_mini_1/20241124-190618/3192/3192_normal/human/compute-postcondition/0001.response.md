The variable `arr` is assigned an empty list. The previous value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is simply an input integer within the specified range. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list**
