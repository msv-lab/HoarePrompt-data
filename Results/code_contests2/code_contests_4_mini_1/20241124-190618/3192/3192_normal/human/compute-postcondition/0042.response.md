The loop iterates from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, updating `temp` to be the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. If `arr1[0]` is less than or equal to 1, the loop will not execute, and `temp` will remain unchanged.

Considering the iterations and potential edge cases:

- If `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, and `temp` remains 0.
- If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the loop executes `arr1[0] - 1` times, updating `temp` with each iteration based on the values in `arr1`.

Output State: **If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`. If `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, `temp` remains 0.**
