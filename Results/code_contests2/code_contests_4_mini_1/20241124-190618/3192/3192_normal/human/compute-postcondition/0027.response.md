According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the first element of the `arr1` list (`arr1[0]`). The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and `arr1[0]` is known to be greater than or equal to 3. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented to 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 4.

State: **`temp` is updated to `max(temp, arr1[3])`, `i` is n - 1, `j` is 4, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer where `arr1[0]` is greater than 4**
