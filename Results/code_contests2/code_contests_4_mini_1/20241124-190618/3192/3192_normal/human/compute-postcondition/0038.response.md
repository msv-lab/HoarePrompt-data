`temp` is assigned the value of `max(temp, arr1[j])`. Since `j` is 1, we look at the value of `arr1[1]`. The value of `temp` remains unchanged before this assignment. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged `temp` and the new value of `temp`, which depends on the comparison between its previous value and `arr1[1]`.

Output State: **`temp` remains unchanged; `arr1[0]` is at least 2; `j` is 1; `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[1])**
