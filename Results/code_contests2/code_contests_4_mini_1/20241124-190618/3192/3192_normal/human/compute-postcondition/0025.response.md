According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, which indicates that `arr1[0]` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again. 

To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` is now 3, and since `arr1[0]` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue, we keep `arr1[0]` as greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`temp` is either max(0, arr1[2]) or max(arr1[1], arr1[2]), `i` is n - 1, `j` is 3, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer where `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 3**
