The code appends the value of `temp` to the list `arr`. The state of `temp` is dependent on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is assigned the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`. If `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, `temp` remains 0. Therefore, the output state can be described based on the conditions.

Output State: **`arr` is updated with `temp`, where `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, or `temp` is 0 if `arr1[0]` is 1 or less.**
