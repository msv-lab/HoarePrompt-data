To evaluate the impact of the provided code snippet:

1. The variable `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`.
2. `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr`, which remains unchanged in this statement.
3. The value of `arr[i]` is taken from the `arr` list at index `i`, which is currently 1.
4. The value of `arr2[i]` is taken from the `arr2` list at the same index `i`, which is also currently 1.
5. The calculation effectively increases `ans` by the product of `(maxval - arr[1])` and `arr2[1]`.

Assuming the values in `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval` are appropriately defined:

- Letâ€™s denote `arr[1]` as `a1` and `arr2[1]` as `b1`. 
- Then, `ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - a1) * b1`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values found in each of the input lists, `arr2` contains the sizes of each corresponding input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
