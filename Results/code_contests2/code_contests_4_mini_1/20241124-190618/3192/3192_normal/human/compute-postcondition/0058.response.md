The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It operates on a set of constraints related to the number of companies `n`, the number of employees `m_i` in each company, and their salaries. The specific output of the function is not provided, but it is implied that the function processes the information about companies, employees, and salaries.

Given the constraints:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- Each company has `m_i` employees where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 200,000.
- All salaries are positive integers not exceeding 10^9.
- The total number of employees across all companies does not exceed 200,000.

The functionality of the function is not explicitly defined in terms of the return value. Therefore, we can summarize it as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes data related to companies, their employees, and salaries under specified constraints.**
