The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. The previous value of `temp` can either be `max(0, arr1[2])` or `max(arr1[1], arr1[2])`, depending on the values of `arr1`. The value of `j` is 3, so `arr1[j]` refers to the fourth element in the list, which is an integer. This means `temp` will be assigned the value of `max(temp, arr1[3])`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is updated to `max(temp, arr1[3])`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 3, and `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer where `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 3.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to `max(temp, arr1[3])`, `i` is n - 1, `j` is 3, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer where `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 3**
