According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, starting from `i = 0` and going up to `i = n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, as indicated by the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. Given that `arr` and `arr2` are empty lists and `maxval` is initialized to 0, these variables do not affect the ability of the loop to execute, but they may be used within the loop body.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `n` is at least 1 and establish the initial value of `i` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list**
