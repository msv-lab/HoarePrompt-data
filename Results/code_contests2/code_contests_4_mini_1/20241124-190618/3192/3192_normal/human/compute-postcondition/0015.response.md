The value of `temp` is appended to `arr`. The value of `temp` depends on the condition of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value of `arr1` from indexes 1 to `arr1[0]-1`. If `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, `temp` remains 0, and thus `arr` will have 0 appended to it. Therefore, the output state captures the condition of `arr1[0]` and the appended `temp` value.

Output State: **If arr1[0] is greater than 1, temp is the maximum value of arr1 from indexes 1 to arr1[0]-1; otherwise, temp is 0, and arr is updated accordingly.**
