According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr1[0]`. The loop iterates while `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `j` as 1 and `arr1[0]` greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be at least 2, and `j` should be incremented to 2.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is greater than 0, `j` is 2**
