According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is at least 2, which means the loop can execute again.

To prepare for the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `j` should be updated to 2. Since we know `temp` remains unchanged and `arr1[0]` is at least 2, we do not need to change `arr1[0]`. 

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`temp` remains unchanged; `arr1[0]` is at least 2; `j` is 2**
