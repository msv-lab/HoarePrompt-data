The code assigns `arr1` the value of a list created from the input provided by `raw_input()`, which is split into individual string elements and then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial state indicates that `arr` and `arr2` are empty lists, and `n` is at least 1. The values of `arr1` will depend on the input given.

Since the initial state does not provide specific input values, it is undetermined what `arr1` will contain after executing the code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `arr1` has been assigned a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, and `arr1` is a list of integers from input**
