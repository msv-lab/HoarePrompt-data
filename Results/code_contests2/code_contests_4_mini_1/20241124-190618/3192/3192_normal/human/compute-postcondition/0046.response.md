According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` and need to determine the next value of `i` for the next iteration. Since `i` is currently at its last value in the previous iteration, we need to increment it by 1 for the next iteration. 

Furthermore, since `n` is not specified as being greater or less than `i`, we can assert that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`arr` is updated with `temp`, `arr2` now includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated based on the maximum of `arr[i]` and its previous value, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`**
