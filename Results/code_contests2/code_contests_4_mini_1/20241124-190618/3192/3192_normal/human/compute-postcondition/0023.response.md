According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Therefore, `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, there is no need to change that condition.

The adjusted states will be:
- `temp` remains unchanged (it can be either 0 or arr1[1])
- `i` remains unchanged (it is n - 1)
- `j` needs to be updated to 2, indicating the next index in the loop.

State: **`temp` is either 0 or arr1[1], `i` is n - 1, `j` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
