According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, since the range for `j` starts at 1 and goes up to (but does not include) `arr1[0]`. 

Before the loop starts, `maxval` is updated, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is 0, and `arr1` is a list of integers from user input. For the loop to be executed, `arr1` must have at least one integer, and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. Additionally, `j` needs to start at 1.

State: **`maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[n-1]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1**
