According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. In order for the loop to execute, `arr1` must contain at least one element (which `n` being at least 1 implies), and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `arr1[0] - 1`. 

Given that `n` is at least 1, we can confirm that `arr1` exists with at least one integer. To ensure that the loop executes, we also need `arr1[0]` to be greater than 1. 

The initial values of `i`, `maxval`, `arr`, `arr2`, and `temp` do not affect the execution of this specific loop, except for maintaining their initial values.

Thus, to execute the loop, we need to state that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is initialized to 1 (the starting value of the loop).

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1**
