The variable `maxval` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer within the specified range, and `arr` is still an empty list. The assignment of `maxval` does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0**
