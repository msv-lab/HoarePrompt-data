To analyze the impact of the code snippet provided, we need to determine the value of `temp` after executing the line of code.

1. The variable `temp` is initially set to `0`. 
2. The code `temp = max(temp, arr1[j])` assigns to `temp` the maximum value between the current value of `temp` (which is `0`) and the value at `arr1[j]`.
3. Since `j` is `1`, we will evaluate `arr1[1]`.

Now, `arr1` is known to be a list of integers with at least one integer, and importantly, `arr1[0]` is greater than `1`, but we do not have the exact values of the list. However, since we are taking the maximum of `0` and `arr1[1]`, the outcome for `temp` will depend on the value of `arr1[1]`.

Assuming:
- If `arr1[1] > 0`, `temp` will be updated to `arr1[1]`.
- If `arr1[1] <= 0`, `temp` will remain `0`.

Considering the provided conditions, we conclude that `temp` will take the value of the maximum of `0` and `arr1[1]`. However, without specific values for `arr1`, the precise value of `temp` cannot be determined.

Since the other variables (`maxval`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected by this line of code, we focus solely on `temp`.

Output State: **`temp` is either 0 or arr1[1] depending on its value; `i` is n - 1, `j` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1.**
