To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet in the context of the initial state.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `arr` is updated with `temp`, where `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, or `temp` is 0 if `arr1[0]` is 1 or less.
   - `arr2` now includes `arr1[0]`.

2. **Effect of the Code**:
   - The line `maxval = max(arr[i], maxval)` is looking for the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`.
   - Since `arr` was previously updated with `temp`, we will assume `temp` holds the maximum value calculated from `arr1` based on the conditions given.
   - However, without initializing `maxval` or knowing its previous value, we cannot determine its new value after this line executes.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The maximum value (`maxval`) is updated based on the current value of `arr[i]`, but since `maxval`'s previous state is unknown, we cannot specify its exact value after the line runs.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is updated with `temp`, `arr2` now includes `arr1[0]`, and `maxval` is updated based on the maximum of `arr[i]` and its previous value.**
