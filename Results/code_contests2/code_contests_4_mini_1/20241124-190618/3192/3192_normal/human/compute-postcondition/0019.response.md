In the provided code, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from user input, split into separate values and converted to integers. The previous state mentions that `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[n-1]` and the previous `maxval`, but does not provide information about the array `arr` or the specific value of `n`. Therefore, the output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[n-1]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr1` is a list of integers from user input.**
