To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we must analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables.

1. The variable `ans` is updated by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]` to it.
2. The existing values of `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, and `ans` influence the calculation.
3. The value of `i` is given as `2`, which means we will look at `arr[2]` and `arr2[2]`.

Now, let's denote the following:
- `arr[i]` corresponds to `arr[2]`
- `arr2[i]` corresponds to `arr2[2]`

As a result, after performing the calculation `ans += (maxval - arr[2]) * arr2[2]`, only the variable `ans` is modified. The other variables (`arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state captures the state of all the variables while noting that `ans` has been updated based on the calculation.

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values found in each of the input lists, `arr2` contains the sizes of each corresponding input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**.
