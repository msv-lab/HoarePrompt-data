Output State: **`ans` is equal to the total calculated from the formula `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` summed over all iterations from `i=0` to `i=n-1`, where `arr` contains the maximum values found in each of the input lists, `arr2` contains the sizes of each corresponding input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr`. If `n` is 0, `ans` remains 0 and is printed.**
