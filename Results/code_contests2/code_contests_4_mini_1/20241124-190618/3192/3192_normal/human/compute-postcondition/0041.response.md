According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `arr1[0]` is at least 2. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` should be incremented to 3.

State: **`temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[2]), `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `j` is 3**
