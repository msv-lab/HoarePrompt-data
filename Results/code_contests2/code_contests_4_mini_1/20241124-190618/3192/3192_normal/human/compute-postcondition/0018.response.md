According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The loop will execute again if `i + 1` is still less than `n`.

Since `maxval` has been updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, we need to ensure that `i` is updated to reflect the next index in the array for the next iteration. If `i` is currently `n - 1`, the loop cannot execute again, so we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now `n - 1` for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[n-1]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is n - 1, `n` is greater than n - 1**
