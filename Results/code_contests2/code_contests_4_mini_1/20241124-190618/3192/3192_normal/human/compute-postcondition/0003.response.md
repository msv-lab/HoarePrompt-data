The code assigns an empty list to `arr2`. This doesn't affect the previous values of `n`, `arr`, or `maxval`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list**
