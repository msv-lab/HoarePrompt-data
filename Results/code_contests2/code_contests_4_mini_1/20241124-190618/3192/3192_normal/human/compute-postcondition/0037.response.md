According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is one less than its next value, which means `j` is currently at a value such that `j + 1` would equal `arr1[0]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Thus, the next state will have `j` increased by 1, and we also need to ensure that `arr1[0]` is at least 2 for the loop to execute again (since `j` starts from 1). 

State: **`temp` remains unchanged; `arr1[0]` is at least 2; `j` is 1**
