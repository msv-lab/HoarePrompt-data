The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Given that `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, and `j` is 2, we will evaluate `arr1[2]`. The output state depends on the values of `temp` and `arr1[2]`. Therefore, `temp` can be either `max(0, arr1[2])` or `max(arr1[1], arr1[2])` depending on the initial value of `temp`.

Output State: **`temp` is either max(0, arr1[2]) or max(arr1[1], arr1[2]), `i` is n - 1, `j` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
