According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has a certain value, and we need to determine if it is less than `n` for the loop to continue.

Since the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be adjusted to be `i + 1` and it should remain less than `n`. 

Assuming the state at the end of the previous iteration had `i` such that it was the last value before `n` (i.e., `i` was `n-1`), then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to `n`, which means the loop will not run again since `i` would now be equal to `n`. 

However, if `i` was `n-2` or less, we would increment `i` and check that it remains less than `n`. Assuming that `i` was `n-2`:

State: **`temp` is the maximum value of `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, otherwise `temp` is 0 if `arr1[0]` is 1 or less; `arr2` has `arr1[0]` appended to it; `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and its previous value; `i` is `n-1`**
