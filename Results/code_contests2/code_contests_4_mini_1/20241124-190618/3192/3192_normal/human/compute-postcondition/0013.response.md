To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in xrange(1, arr1[0]):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`.
2. The current state indicates that `j` is 3 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, which means that the loop has already been executed at least for `j = 1`, `j = 2`, and `j = 3` in the past iteration.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 4. Therefore, we must ensure that `arr1[0]` is greater than 4.

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` needs to be incremented to 4.
- `arr1[0]` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 4.

Thus, the adjusted state will be:
State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 4, `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[3]), `j` is 4**
