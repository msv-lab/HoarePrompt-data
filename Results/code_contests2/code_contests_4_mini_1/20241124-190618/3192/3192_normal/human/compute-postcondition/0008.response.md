The statement `temp = max(temp, arr1[j])` assigns the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]` to `temp`. 

Given the initial state:
- `temp` is 0
- `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and since `j` is 1, we will be accessing `arr1[1]` (assuming `arr1` has at least 2 elements).

Since `arr1[1]` is not specified, but it must be an integer, we denote it as `arr1[1]`. The maximum value will be compared between `0` and `arr1[1]`. Therefore:
- If `arr1[1]` is greater than `0`, `temp` will be updated to `arr1[1]`.
- If `arr1[1]` is less than or equal to `0`, `temp` remains `0`.

Since `arr1[1]` is an integer greater than `0` (because `arr1[0]` is greater than `1`), we can assume that `temp` will be updated to a value greater than `0`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**.
