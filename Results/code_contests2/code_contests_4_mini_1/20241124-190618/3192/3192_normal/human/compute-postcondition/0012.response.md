The `temp` variable is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Given that `j` is 3, we need to check the value of `arr1[3]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `maxval`, and `arr2` are not altered by this operation, and the only variable affected is `temp`.

Since `temp` is updated based on the value of `arr1[3]`, we do not know the specific value of `arr1[3]`, but we know `arr1[0]` is greater than 3. Therefore, the output state reflects that `temp` is updated but without specifying the exact value it will take.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3, `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[3]), `j` is 3**
