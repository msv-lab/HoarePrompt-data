The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, it can be inferred that `arr1[j]` has a specific integer value at index 2. However, the exact value of `arr1[2]` is not provided in the initial state. The value of `temp` will be updated to either its current value or the value at `arr1[2]`, which is greater than 0.

Therefore, the output must reflect that `temp` may or may not change depending on the value of `arr1[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[2]), `j` is 2**
