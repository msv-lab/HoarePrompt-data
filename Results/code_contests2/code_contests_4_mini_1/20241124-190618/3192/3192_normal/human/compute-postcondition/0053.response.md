According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 and it should still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 2, as `i` would be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.

State: **`arr` contains the maximum values found in each of the input lists, `arr2` contains the sizes of each corresponding input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
