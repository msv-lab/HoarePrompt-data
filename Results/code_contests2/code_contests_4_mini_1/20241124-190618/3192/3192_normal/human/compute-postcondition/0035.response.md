To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the components of the for loop statement and the given state before it starts.

1. The loop iterates over `j` starting from `1` up to (but not including) `arr1[0]`. 
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than `1`.
3. The variable `j` will start at `1` and increment by `1` with each iteration until it reaches `arr1[0]`.

Based on this understanding, we can identify the following states that need to be adjusted:

- `arr1[0]` must be greater than `1` to ensure the loop runs.
- `j` will start at `1` at the beginning of the loop.

Given these points, we can summarize the state:

State: **`temp` remains unchanged, `arr2` has `arr1[0]` appended to it, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and its previous value, `i` is `n-1`, `arr1` is a list of integers, `temp` is 0, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
