Output State: **After the loop executes `n` times, `arr` contains the maximum values found in each of the input lists (if any), `arr2` contains the sizes of each corresponding input list, and `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, `arr` remains empty, `arr2` remains empty, and `maxval` remains 0. If any list has a size of 1 or less, `temp` will be 0 for that iteration, affecting the corresponding value in `arr`.**
