The code `arr2.append(arr1[0])` appends the value of `arr1[0]` to the list `arr2`. The value of `arr1[0]` is not specified in the initial state, but it is the first element of `arr1`. The other variables, including `temp` and the state of `arr`, are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will indicate the current value of `arr1[0]` being appended to `arr2`.

Output State: **`arr2` is updated to include the value of `arr1[0]`**
