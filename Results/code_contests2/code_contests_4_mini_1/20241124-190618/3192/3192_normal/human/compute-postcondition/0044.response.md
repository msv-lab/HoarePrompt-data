The code appends the value of `arr1[0]` to the list `arr2`. The state of `arr` and `temp` is not affected by this operation, so the output state will focus on the current values of `arr`, `temp`, and the new value added to `arr2`. 

Output State: **`arr` is updated with `temp`, where `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, or `temp` is 0 if `arr1[0]` is 1 or less; `arr2` now includes `arr1[0]`.**
