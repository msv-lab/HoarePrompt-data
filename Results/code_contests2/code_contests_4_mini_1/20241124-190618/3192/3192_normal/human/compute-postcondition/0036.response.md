The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of `temp` (which is 0) and `arr1[j]`. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, we know that `arr1[j]` (where `j` is 1) could potentially be greater than 0 depending on its value. However, without knowing `arr1[1]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `temp` after this operation. Therefore, the output state indicates that `temp` could change but is ultimately dependent on the unknown value of `arr1[j]`.

Output State: **`temp` remains unchanged; `temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[j]`**.
