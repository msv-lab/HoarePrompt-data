To determine the output state after executing the given code, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: `arr` contains the maximum values found in each of the input lists, `arr2` contains the sizes of each corresponding input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0.

Executing the code:
```
ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]
```
Step by step:
1. The variable `i` is currently 0.
2. The value `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which is the first element in the `arr` list.
3. We calculate `(maxval - arr[i])`, where `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr` and `arr[i]` is the first element in `arr`.
4. This result is then multiplied by `arr2[i]`, which refers to `arr2[0]`, the size of the first corresponding input list.
5. The product is then added to the current value of `ans`.

Since the exact contents of `arr`, `arr2`, and the specific values of `maxval` and `arr[i]` are not provided, we can only determine that `ans` will be updated based on the calculation above.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values found in each of the input lists, `arr2` contains the sizes of each corresponding input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**.
