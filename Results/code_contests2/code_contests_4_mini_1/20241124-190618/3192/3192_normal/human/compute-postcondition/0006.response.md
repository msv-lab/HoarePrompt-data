The variable `temp` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, as no operations are performed on them. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `temp` while other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, and `temp` is 0**
