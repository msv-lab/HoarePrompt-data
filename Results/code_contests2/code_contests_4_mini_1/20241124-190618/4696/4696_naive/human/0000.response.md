To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n that yields the maximum possible value of f(p). The value of f(p) is defined by the given permutation, and the permutations that yield this maximum value must be considered.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads two integers n and m, where n is the length of the permutation and m is the index of the permutation we need to find (1-based). It then constructs the list of numbers from 1 to n and determines the m-th permutation in lexicographical order.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The line `raw_input().split()` reads the input and splits it into two parts.
   - `n` is set to the first part (length of the permutation).
   - `i` is set to the second part, offset by 1 to convert it to a 0-based index.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - The list `p = range(1, n + 1)` creates a list of numbers from 1 to n.
   - The program then loops through each position in the permutation (from 1 to n).
   - It calculates the factorial of the remaining numbers to determine how many permutations can be formed with the remaining numbers.
   - The index for the next number in the permutation is calculated, and that number is printed and removed from the list.

3. **Output**: 
   - The program prints each number of the permutation one by one.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not appear to handle the case where `m` exceeds the total number of permutations, which is `n!`. If `m` is greater than `n!`, the program will give an incorrect output since it assumes there will always be a valid `m-th` permutation.
- Additionally, the use of `print(p[d])` inside a tuple is incorrect and unnecessary; it should simply be `print(p[d])` without the parentheses.

### Example of Failure:
If we consider the input `3 7`, since there are only 6 permutations of the numbers {1, 2, 3}, the program will attempt to access an index that doesn't exist. This would lead to an incorrect output or an error.

### Conclusion:
Due to the potential issue with handling cases where `m` is greater than the number of possible permutations, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
