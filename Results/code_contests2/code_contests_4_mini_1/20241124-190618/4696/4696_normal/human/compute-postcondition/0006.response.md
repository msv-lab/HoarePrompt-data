The variable `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 1, the expression simplifies to `factorial(n - 1)`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `n - 1` will be non-negative. The output state reflects the values of the involved variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 1)`**
