The variable `f` is reassigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 3, `f` will now hold the value of `factorial(n - 3)`. The previous value of `f` was `factorial(n - 2)`, and since `d` is undefined, it does not affect the outcome. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 3)`, and `d` is undefined.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 3)`, and `d` is undefined**
