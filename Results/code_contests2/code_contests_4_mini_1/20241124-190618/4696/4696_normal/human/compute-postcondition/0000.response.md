The code takes input values for `a` and `b` using `raw_input()` and splits them into two variables. The initial states of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this line of code. The values of `a` and `b` will be determined by the user input, but we do not know the specific values at this moment.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `m`, while `a` and `b` are assigned input strings.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are input strings**
