According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2. Since the loop is defined with `k` starting at 1 and going up to `n`, the state of `k` needs to be adjusted to reflect that it will be 2 in the next iteration. The value of `i` remains undefined and does not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 1)`**
