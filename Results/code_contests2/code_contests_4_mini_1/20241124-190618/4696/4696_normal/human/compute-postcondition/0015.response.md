The code attempts to remove an element from the list `p` using the index `d`. However, since `d` is undefined (due to `i` being undefined), it leads to an error when trying to access `p[d]`. Therefore, the output state indicates that no changes occur to the state of the variables, and the operation cannot be completed due to the undefined variable.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 2)`, `d` is undefined, and the operation cannot be completed due to the undefined variable `d`.**
