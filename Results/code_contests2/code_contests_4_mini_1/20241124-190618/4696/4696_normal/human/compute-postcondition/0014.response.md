The code attempts to access and print the value of `p[d]`. However, `d` is assigned the value of `i // f`, where `i` is undefined, making `d` itself undefined. Since we cannot determine the value of `d`, we cannot ascertain `p[d]` without knowing the value of `i` and consequently `d`. Therefore, the output state reflects the uncertainty of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 2)`, `d` is undefined due to `i` being undefined, and we cannot access `p[d]`.**
