The code attempts to print `p[d]` where `d` is assigned the value of `i // f`. However, since `i` is undefined, `d` remains undefined. As a result, trying to access `p[d]` will lead to an error because `d` does not have a valid value. 

Since the output state does not change any variables and `d` is undefined, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 3)`, and `d` is undefined while attempting to print `p[d]` raises an error.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 3)`, and `d` is undefined while attempting to print `p[d]` raises an error.**
