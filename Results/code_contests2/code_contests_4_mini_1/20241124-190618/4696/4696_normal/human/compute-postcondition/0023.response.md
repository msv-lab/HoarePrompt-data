According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `k`, which is initialized to start at 1 and continues until it is greater than `n`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4. Since `n` is at least 3, it is still possible for the loop to execute again if `n` is at least 4.

Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to 4. Since `n` can remain greater than or equal to 3, but we want to ensure the loop can continue, we will specify `n` to be at least 4.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 4, `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 3)`, and `i` is updated to `i % f`**.
