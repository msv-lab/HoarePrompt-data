The variable `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 2, we can substitute this into the equation, resulting in `f = factorial(n - 2)`. The initial value of `f` was `factorial(n - 1)`, but it is now overwritten by the new calculation. The previous values of the variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `f` is now equal to `factorial(n - 2)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 2)`**
