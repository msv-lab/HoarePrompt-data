The value of `i` is updated to `i % f`, where `f` is defined as `factorial(n - 3)`. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, but does not specify a concrete value for `i`. The calculation of `i % f` will depend on the specific value of `i`, which is currently unknown. The values of `k` and the error with `d` being undefined do not affect this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the update made to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 3)`, and `i` is updated to `i % f`**
