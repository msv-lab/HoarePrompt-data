To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state:

- The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state.
- The variable `f` is defined as `factorial(n - 1)`, which is based on the value of `n`, which is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `f` will be a positive integer (at least `1` for `n = 1`).
- The code `d = i // f` attempts to perform an integer division of `i` by `f`.

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot compute a value for `d`. Thus, we note that the calculation cannot be completed due to the undefined variable.

The output state reflects that `i` is not defined, and therefore we cannot determine `d`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 1)`, and `i` is not defined.**
