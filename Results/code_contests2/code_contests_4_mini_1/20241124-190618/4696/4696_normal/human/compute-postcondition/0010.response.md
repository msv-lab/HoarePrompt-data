The value of `i` is assigned the result of `i % f`. However, since `i` is not defined initially, this results in an error due to the use of an undefined variable. Therefore, the output state is that `i` is not defined and the operation cannot be completed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 1)`, the value of `i` is not defined, and the operation cannot be completed due to undefined `i`.**
