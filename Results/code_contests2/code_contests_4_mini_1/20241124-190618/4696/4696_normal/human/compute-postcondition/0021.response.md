The code attempts to remove an element from the list `p` using the index `d`, which is currently undefined. Since `d` is undefined, this operation will result in an error. The values of `n`, `k`, and `f` remain unchanged, but the program fails to execute successfully due to the error. Therefore, the output state indicates that an error occurred.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 3)`, and an error occurred due to `d` being undefined in `p.remove(p[d])`**
