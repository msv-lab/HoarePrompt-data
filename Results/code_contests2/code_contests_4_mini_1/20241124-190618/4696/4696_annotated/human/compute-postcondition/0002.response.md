The value of `i` is assigned the value of `int(b)`, where `b` is an input value. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are input values, and `i` is assigned the integer value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is now the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are input values, and `i` is assigned the integer value of `b`.**
