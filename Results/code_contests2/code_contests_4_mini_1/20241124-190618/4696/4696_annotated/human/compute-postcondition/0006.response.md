The value of `f` is assigned the result of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `n` is `a` (where `a` is greater than or equal to 1) and `k` is 1, we can calculate `n - k` as `a - 1`. The factorial function computes the product of all positive integers up to that number, so `factorial(a - 1)` will yield a specific result depending on the value of `a`. 

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `n` is `a`
- `k` is 1

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is `a`, `k` is 1, and `f` is `factorial(a - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is `a`, `k` is 1, and `f` is `factorial(a - 1)`**
