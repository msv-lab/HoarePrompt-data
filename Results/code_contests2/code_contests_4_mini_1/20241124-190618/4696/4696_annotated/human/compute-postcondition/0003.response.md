The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Since `i` was assigned the integer value of `b`, the output state now reflects that `i` will be `b - 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is now the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are input values, and `i` is the integer value of `b - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is now the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are input values, and `i` is the integer value of `b - 1**
