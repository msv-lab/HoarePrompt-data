The value of `i` is updated to be `i % f`. The previous value of `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`, which is defined since `n` is at least 2. Therefore, `f` is non-zero. The specific value of `i` is dependent on its previous state, which is undefined, but it is modified by the modulus operation with `f`. The variable `d` remains dependent on the undefined `i`, and the state of the list `p` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), `d` is dependent on undefined `i`, and `i` is updated to `i % f`**
