According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop executes for each integer `k` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. Given that `n` is currently the integer value of `a`, we need to ensure `a` is greater than or equal to 1. 

Additionally, we need to initialize `k` to the first value in the loop range, which is 1. Therefore, the relevant states are:

- `n` must be at least 1 (which means `a` should be at least 1),
- `k` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is `a` (where `a` is greater than or equal to 1), `k` is 1**
