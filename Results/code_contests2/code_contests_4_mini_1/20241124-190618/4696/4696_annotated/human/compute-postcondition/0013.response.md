The value of `d` is assigned the result of `i // f`. However, the value of `i` is undefined in this context, making it impossible to determine the exact value of `d`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), and `p` has an element removed at index `d`. Since `d` cannot be calculated due to the undefined `i`, we cannot provide a definitive output for `d`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `d` is dependent on `i`, which is undefined.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), `d` is dependent on undefined `i`, and `p` has an element removed at index `d`.**
