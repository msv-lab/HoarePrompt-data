The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(a)`, where `a` is an input value. Since `n` is initially constrained to be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, it will now take the integer value of `a` after conversion. The states of `m`, `b`, and any other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are input values.

Output State: **`n` is now the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are input values**
