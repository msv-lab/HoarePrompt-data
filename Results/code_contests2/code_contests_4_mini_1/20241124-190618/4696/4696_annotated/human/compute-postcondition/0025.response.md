The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as it does not take any input. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p). The function's output is determined by these parameters, although they are not directly passed to the function. The output is not specified in the provided information, so the exact return value cannot be determined.

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints of positive integers n and m, with specific limits, but does not accept parameters directly and the return value is not specified.**
