The value of `d` is assigned the result of `i // f`, where `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`. Since `n` is at least 3, `n - 2` is at least 1, meaning `f` will be at least 1 (as `factorial(1)` is 1). The value of `i` is not defined, so the exact value of `d` cannot be calculated. However, `d` will be an integer value resulting from the integer division of `i` by `f`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), `d` is dependent on undefined `i`, and `i` is updated to `i % f`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), `d` is dependent on undefined `i`, and `i` is updated to `i % f**
