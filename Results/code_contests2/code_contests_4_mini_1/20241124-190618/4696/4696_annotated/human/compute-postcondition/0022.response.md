The value of `i` is updated to `i % f`, where `f` is defined as `factorial(n - 2)`. However, the initial value of `i` is undefined, and we cannot perform the modulus operation without knowing `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects that the operation cannot be completed due to the undefined value of `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), `d` is dependent on undefined `i`, `p` is undefined; cannot compute `i = i % f` due to undefined `i`.**
