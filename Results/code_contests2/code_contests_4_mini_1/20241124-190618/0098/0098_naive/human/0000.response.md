To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we first need to analyze the requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
- We need to find the square of the minimum size such that a 2n-gon can be embedded in a square.
- The input is a number of test cases `T`, followed by `T` odd integers `n`.
- The output should be the minimum length of a side of the square for each test case.
- The output must be accurate to within an absolute or relative error of \(10^{-6}\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is as follows:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))

for ca in xrange(int(raw_input())):
    n = int(raw_input())
    print('%.9f' % func_1(n))
```

1. **Function Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates a value using trigonometric functions. 
   - It computes the value based on `n` to find the side length required to embed the 2n-gon in a square.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `T` test cases and then reads `n` for each test case. The use of `xrange` and `raw_input` suggests this is written for Python 2.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The output format prints the result to 9 decimal places, which meets the requirement for precision.

### Edge Cases and Validity:
- The problem specifies that `n` will always be an odd integer between 3 and 199. 
- We must consider if the function handles all odd integers in this range correctly and if the computation of the side length is valid.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Mathematical Validity**: 
   - The formula used in `func_1` needs to be verified to ensure it correctly computes the minimum square side for embedding a 2n-gon.
   - The 2n-gon is specified, and it must be ensured that the calculations correctly reflect the geometry of a 2n-gon rather than an n-gon. 

2. **Trigonometric Calculations**:
   - The calculations involve `cos` and `sin` functions, and any misapplication could lead to incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect Functionality**:
   - If the formula does not yield the correct side length for some value of `n`, the program is incorrect.

### Verification:
We can manually check for a small odd integer, say `n = 3`:
- For `n = 3`, 2n = 6 (hexagon). The minimum square side that can embed a hexagon is known to be approximately \( 1.732 \) (based on geometric properties). 
- The function `func_1(3)` should return approximately `1.732`, but we need to calculate it using the given formula.
  
After evaluating the formula:
- \( \text{func_1(3)} = \cos(\pi / 12) / \sin(\pi / 6) \)
- Calculating these values leads to a result which does not match the known geometric requirement or expected output.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential discrepancies and the failure of the formula to yield correct results for the geometry of a 2n-gon, the program does not satisfy the problem description for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
