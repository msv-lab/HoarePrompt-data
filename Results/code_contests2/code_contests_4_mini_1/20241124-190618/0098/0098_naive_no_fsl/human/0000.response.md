To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the minimum side length of a square that can embed a regular polygon with \(2n\) vertices, based on the description provided.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Input**: The program reads multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an odd integer \(n\), which represents the number of vertices of the polygon as \(2n\).
2. **Output**: For each test case, the program should output the minimum side length of a square that can contain the \(2n\)-gon.
3. **Mathematical Model**: The polygon is regular, meaning all sides and angles are equal. The calculation for the minimum side length of the square is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{side length} = \frac{\cos(\frac{\pi}{4n})}{\sin(\frac{\pi}{2n})}
   \]
   This formula is derived from geometry involving the inscribed circle and the properties of regular polygons.

### Code Analysis
The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` which computes the side length using the above formula. It then reads the number of test cases and uses the function to print the results formatted to 9 decimal places.

### Potential Issues
1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `xrange` which is not defined in Python 3 (if thatâ€™s the version intended). The correct function in Python 3 would be `range`.
2. **Mathematical Errors**: The mathematical operations seem correct, but edge cases need to be confirmed, especially since \(n\) is guaranteed to be odd and within the given range. There are no apparent edge cases that would cause a division by zero or invalid operations given the constraints.
3. **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to 9 decimal places as specified. This meets the requirement that the answer's absolute or relative error doesn't exceed \(10^{-6}\).

### Test Cases
- For \(n = 3\), the expected output is approximately \(1.931851653\).
- For \(n = 5\), the expected output is approximately \(3.196226611\).
- For \(n = 199\), the expected output is approximately \(126.687663595\).

We can check a few values of \(n\) (which are odd) and see if the output matches the expected results. 

### Conclusion
I have not identified any case where the program does not perform as expected concerning the problem description. The logic appears sound, and the formula used is appropriate for the problem.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
