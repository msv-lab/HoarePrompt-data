Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n`, which is expected to be an odd integer between 3 and 199, and returns the value of the expression `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. However, if `n` is 0 or an even integer, it will lead to a division by zero error in the sine function, which is not handled by the function. Therefore, in practice, the function may raise an error if `n` is not within the specified range or if it is an even integer. **
