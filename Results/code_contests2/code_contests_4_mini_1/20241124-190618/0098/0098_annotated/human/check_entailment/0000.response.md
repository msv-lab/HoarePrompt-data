To verify the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze the code logic and the problem description requirements.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
1. **Input**: The program receives `T`, the number of test cases, followed by `T` odd integers `n` (where `3 ≤ n ≤ 199`).
2. **Output**: For each test case, it should compute the minimum length of the side of a square that can contain a 2n-gon.
3. **Mathematical Relation**: The formula appears to be derived from geometric principles involving regular polygons and their relations to enclosing squares.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    # The program returns the value of the expression math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)), where n is an odd integer between 3 and 199.
```

1. **Mathematical Functions**: 
   - `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n))` computes the cosine of an angle that depends on `n`.
   - `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` computes the sine of another angle that also depends on `n`.

2. **Understanding the Formula**: 
   - The expression combines cosine and sine functions, likely to derive a relationship based on trigonometric identities related to regular polygons.
   - The formula is designed to calculate a specific geometric property of the 2n-gon in relation to an enclosing square.

3. **Input Constraints**: The function is designed to accept only odd integers within the specified range. This aligns well with the problem description that states `n` should be odd.

### Testing Validity:
To confirm correctness, we can check:
- **Example Cases**: 
   - For `n = 3`: The expected output is `1.931851653`.
   - For `n = 5`: The expected output is `3.196226611`.
   - For `n = 199`: The expected output is `126.687663595`.

Using the provided formula:
- For `n = 3`: 
  - `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * 3)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * 3))` gives approximately `1.931851653`, which is correct.
- For `n = 5`: 
  - `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * 5)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * 5))` gives approximately `3.196226611`, which is correct.
- For `n = 199`: 
  - `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * 199)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * 199))` gives approximately `126.687663595`, which is also correct.

### Edge Cases:
Since the formula is well-defined for all odd integers in the specified range, and there are no apparent missing edge cases or logical flaws in the code, we can conclude that the program meets the requirements as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the mathematical requirements for embedding a 2n-gon in a square for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
