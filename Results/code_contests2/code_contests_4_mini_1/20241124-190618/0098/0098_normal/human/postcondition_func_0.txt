The function accepts an integer `n`, which is expected to be an odd integer between 3 and 199. It returns the result of the expression `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. However, if `n` is not in the specified range or if `n` is even, the behavior is undefined since the function does not handle these cases, potentially leading to division by zero errors or invalid inputs.
