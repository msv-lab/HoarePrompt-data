According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `c` represents the first character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be updated to the next character in `s`. 

Since `s` is a non-empty string, if `c` is currently the first character, the next character in the loop will be the second character of `s`. Therefore, we need to set `c` to the next character in `s`, and the loop will continue until all characters in `s` have been processed.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `c` is now the second character in `s` and the first character will have been processed.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the second character of `s`, and `memo[c]` is updated (new value is 1 if `c` was added, or incremented by 1 if `c` was already in memo)**
