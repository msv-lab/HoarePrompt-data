The code assigns the value `False` to `result`. The previous state of `result` is not provided, but since the next value in `memo` is not specified, we assume the only change is the assignment. Thus, the output state reflects the new value of `result` while stating that `memo` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`memo` contains the frequency of at least two characters in `s`; `result` is False**
