The code initializes an empty dictionary `memo`. The previous state of `w` is not affected by this operation, and `s` remains as the input string. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new variable `memo`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive; `s` is an input string; `memo` is an empty dictionary.**
