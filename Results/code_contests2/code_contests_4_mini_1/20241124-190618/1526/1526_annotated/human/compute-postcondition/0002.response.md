According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character, the loop will execute. The variable `c` will correspond to the first character in `s` during the first iteration. Since `w` is a string with a length between 1 and 100 and `memo` is an empty dictionary, these variables do not affect the loop's ability to execute. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `s` is a non-empty string. At the start of the loop, `c` will be the first character of `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`, `memo` is an empty dictionary**
