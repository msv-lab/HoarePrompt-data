The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `memo` contains the frequency of at least one character in `s`, `result` is False, `x` is the first value in `memo`, and `x` is an odd integer, and we break out of the most internal loop.
