According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `memo` object. The loop will iterate over the values in `memo`, so it is crucial for `memo` to contain at least one character frequency for the loop to execute. Given that the `result` is already set to True, it indicates a positive state, but it does not influence the execution of the loop directly.

For the loop to be executed, `memo` must have at least one entry, meaning it should not be empty. Therefore, we can say that `memo` contains character frequencies for at least one character.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `memo` needs to have at least one entry, and initially, `x` can be set to the first value in `memo`.

State: **`memo` contains the frequency of at least one character in `s`, `result` is True, `x` is the first value in `memo`**
