Postcondition: ***`memo` contains the frequency of at least two characters in `s`. If the next value in `memo` is an odd integer (i.e., `x % 2 > 0`), then `result` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the next value in `memo` is even, the program continues without any changes to `result`.***
