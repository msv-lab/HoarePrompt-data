The code snippet `memo[c] += 1` increments the value associated with key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. Since `c` is the second character of `s`, we know its value, and we also know that if `c` was not previously in `memo`, it was initialized to 0. In either case, the value of `memo[c]` will increase by 1.

1. If `c` was not previously in `memo`, after the operation, `memo[c]` will be 1.
2. If `c` was already in `memo`, its value will be incremented by 1.

However, we do not have the previous value of `memo[c]`, so we cannot specify the exact new value. We can only state that it has been incremented.

The other variables `w`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `memo[c]` and the other variables' states.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the second character of `s`, and `memo[c]` is incremented by 1**.
