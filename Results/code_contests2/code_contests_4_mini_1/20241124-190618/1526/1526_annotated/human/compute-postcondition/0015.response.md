According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `c` must represent the next character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is currently the third character of `s`, which means the next character `c` should be the fourth character in the string `s`. Additionally, `s` should have at least four characters for the loop to continue executing.

Given that `w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `s` is a non-empty string, it is already ensured that `s` has at least three characters (as `c` is the third character). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least four characters.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a string with at least 4 characters, `c` is the fourth character of `s`, and `memo[c]` is incremented by 1**
