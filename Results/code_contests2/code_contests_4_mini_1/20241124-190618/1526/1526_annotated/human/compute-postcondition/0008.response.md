The code assigns the value `0` to `memo[c]`, which indicates that the character `c` is being initialized in the `memo` dictionary (or similar data structure). Since `memo[c]` was previously updated (as stated in the initial state, where it would be `1` if `c` was added previously or incremented if it was already present), this line effectively overwrites that previous value, setting it to `0`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the second character of `s`, and `memo[c]` is set to 0**.
