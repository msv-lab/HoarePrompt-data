The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `memo` contains the frequency of at least three characters in `s`, the next value in `memo` is an odd integer that has not been processed yet, and `result` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
