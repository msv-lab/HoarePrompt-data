Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` is the third character of `s`. If `c` was not previously in `memo`, it is now initialized to 0. If `c` was already present in `memo`, its value remains unchanged.***
