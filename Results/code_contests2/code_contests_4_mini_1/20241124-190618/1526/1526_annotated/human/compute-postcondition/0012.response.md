The variable `memo[c]` is assigned the value `0`. This means that regardless of its previous value, it is now set to `0`. Other variables, including `w`, `s`, and `c`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the third character of `s`, and `memo[c]` is now 0.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the third character of `s`, and `memo[c]` is now 0**
