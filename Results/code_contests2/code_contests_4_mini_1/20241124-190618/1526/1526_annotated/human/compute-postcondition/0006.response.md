The code increments the value associated with the key `c` in the dictionary `memo` by 1. Since `c` is the first character of the non-empty string `s`, and it is stated that if `c` is not already a key in `memo`, it was added with a value of 0, this means that `memo[c]` will now be updated to 1 if `c` was just added or incremented by 1 if it already existed.

Assuming `memo[c]` was initially 0 when `c` was added, after the execution of the code:

- If `c` was previously not in `memo`, its new value will be 1.
- If `c` was already in `memo`, its value will be increased by 1.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `memo[c]` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`, and `memo[c]` is updated (new value is 1 if `c` was added, or incremented by 1 if `c` was already in memo)**
