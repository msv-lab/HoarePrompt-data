The code assigns the value `True` to the variable `result`. The values of the other variables, including `memo`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `memo` remains unchanged, and `result` is now `True`.

Output State: **`memo` contains the frequency of each character in `s`; `result` is True**
