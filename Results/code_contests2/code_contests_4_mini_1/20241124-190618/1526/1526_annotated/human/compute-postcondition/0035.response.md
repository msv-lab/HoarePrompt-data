Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input from the user, counts the frequency of each character in the string, and checks if all character frequencies are even. It prints 'Yes' if all frequencies are even, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not explicitly return any value. If the input string is empty, it still prints 'Yes' since there are no characters with odd frequencies. **
