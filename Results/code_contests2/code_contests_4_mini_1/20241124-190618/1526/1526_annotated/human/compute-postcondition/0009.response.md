Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the second character of `s`, and if `c` was not previously in `memo`, then `memo[c]` is set to 0. If `c` is already in `memo`, its value remains unchanged.***
