According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s` for `c` to take. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the second character of `s`, which means `c` corresponds to the character at index 1 of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to move to the next character in `s`, which means `c` should be the third character of `s` and the index needs to be adjusted to 2.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the third character of `s`, and `memo[c]` is incremented by 1**
