The code assigns the value `0` to the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. Since `memo` is initially empty and `c` is not present in it, this operation will create a new entry in the dictionary. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`, and `memo` now contains the key `c` with the value `0`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`, `memo` is now {c: 0}**
