According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `memo`. The loop iterates over the values in `memo`. Since `memo` contains the frequency of characters in `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be at least one more value in `memo` that has not been iterated over yet.

At the end of the last iteration, `memo` contains the frequency of at least two characters, and the iteration is on `x`, which is the last value processed in the loop. To execute the loop one more time, the next value of `x` must be present in `memo`, and since we are iterating over the values of `memo`, it implies that there must be another value in `memo` to iterate over.

Thus, we need to ensure that `memo` contains at least one additional value beyond what has already been iterated over.

State: **`memo` contains the frequency of at least three characters in `s`, and the next value in `memo` is an odd integer that has not been processed yet.**
