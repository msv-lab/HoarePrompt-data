The code `memo[c] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. If `c` was not present in `memo` before, it is initialized to 0, and thus `memo[c]` becomes 1. If `c` was already present, its value increases by 1. The states of the other variables (`w`, `s`, and `c`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value for `memo[c]`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the third character of `s`, and `memo[c]` is incremented by 1**
