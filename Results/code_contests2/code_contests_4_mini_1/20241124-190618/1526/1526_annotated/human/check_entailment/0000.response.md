To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let’s analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program must determine if a string `w` is "beautiful" based on the following criteria:
- Each lowercase letter of the English alphabet occurs an even number of times in `w`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        
        memo[c] += 1
        
    # State of the program after the for loop has been executed: `memo` contains the frequency of each character in `s`.
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
        
    # State of the program after the for loop has been executed: `result` is True if all values in `memo` are even.
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')
```

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a string input using `raw_input()`. In Python 2, this is correct, but in Python 3, it should be `input()`.

2. **Counting Frequencies**: 
   - A dictionary `memo` is used to count the occurrences of each character in the string `s`.
   - For each character `c` in `s`, it initializes its count in `memo` if it doesn't exist and then increments the count.

3. **Checking Evenness**: 
   - The program checks if all character counts in `memo` are even.
   - If any character has an odd count, it sets `result` to `False` and breaks the loop.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints `'Yes'` if `result` is `True` (indicating `s` is beautiful), and `'No'` otherwise.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Single Character**: If `s` is a single character (e.g., `a`), the output should be `'No'` because `a` occurs once, which is odd.

2. **All Characters Even**: If `s` contains characters that all occur an even number of times (e.g., `aabbcc`), the output should be `'Yes'`.

3. **Empty String**: Although the constraints specify `1 ≤ |w|`, if we consider an empty string as an edge case, the program would return `'Yes'` since there would be no characters to have an odd count.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to check if a string is beautiful according to the given criteria. It handles the counting of characters and checks their frequencies correctly. There are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly identifies whether the string is beautiful based on the frequency of its characters, handling all described cases appropriately.
