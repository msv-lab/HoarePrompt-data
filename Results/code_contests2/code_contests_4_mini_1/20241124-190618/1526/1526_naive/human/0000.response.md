To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

**Problem description**: A string `w` is considered beautiful if each lowercase letter of the English alphabet occurs an even number of times in `w`. 

**Program**:
```python
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        memo[c] += 1
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')
func_1()
```

**Analysis**:
1. The program reads a string input using `raw_input()`, which is valid in Python 2, but in Python 3, it should be `input()`.
2. It initializes a dictionary `memo` to count occurrences of each character in the string `s`.
3. It iterates through each character `c` in `s`, updating the count of each character in `memo`.
4. After counting, it checks if all character counts are even. If any character occurs an odd number of times, it sets `result` to `False` and breaks the loop.
5. Finally, it prints "Yes" if `result` is `True`, otherwise prints "No".

**Potential Cases**:
1. If the input string consists of all characters occurring an even number of times (e.g., "aabbcc"), the program should output "Yes".
2. If the input string consists of characters occurring an odd number of times (e.g., "abc"), the program should output "No".

**Edge Case**:
- The program does not handle the case where the input string is empty (though the constraints state that |w| is at least 1).
- If the input string has characters that are not lowercase letters (which is outside the given constraints but still worth noting).

Despite the potential issues regarding the use of `raw_input()`, the program logic itself for counting characters and checking evenness is correct.

**Conclusion**:
Since the program correctly identifies whether each character occurs an even number of times in the string as per the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly implements the required logic to determine if the string `w` is beautiful based on the specified criteria.
