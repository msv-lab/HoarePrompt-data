According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. The `for` loop iterates over the values of the `memo` dictionary. Since `memo` is a non-empty dictionary with at least 3 values, the loop can execute again as long as there are still values to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `memo` has at least 3 values. However, since the loop iterates over these values, after the last iteration, we can assume that one value has been processed. Therefore, if there were initially 3 values, there will now be 2 left, which allows the loop to execute again.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `memo` must still have at least 3 values, and the value of `x` for the next iteration must be the next value in the dictionary.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `memo` still has at least 3 values remaining. 

State: **`memo` is a non-empty dictionary with at least 3 values remaining**
