According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop will execute and iterate over each character in `s`. Additionally, before the loop starts, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, and `memo` is an empty dictionary, which are not directly affecting the loop execution. At the end of the last iteration, `c` will represent the last character of `s`. 

For the loop to be executed, `s` must not be empty. Therefore, the necessary adjustments are that `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` will be set to the first character of `s` during the first iteration. 

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is an empty dictionary, `c` is the first character of `s`**
