Output State: **`memo` will contain the counts of each character in `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute for each character in `s`, and `memo[c]` will reflect the frequency of each character found in `s`. If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `memo` will remain an empty dictionary.**
