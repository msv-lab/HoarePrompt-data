The code increments the value of `memo[c]` by 1. If `c` was not in `memo` before this line was executed, it would have been initialized to 0, leading to `memo[c]` becoming 1. If `c` was already present, `memo[c]` will simply increase by 1. The other variables (`w` and `s`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `memo[c]`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least two characters, and `memo[c]` is updated to its previous value plus 1**.
