The variable `result` is assigned the value `False`. The state of the other variables, including the dictionary `memo`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `memo` is a non-empty dictionary with at least 3 values; `result` is False.

Output State: **`memo` is a non-empty dictionary with at least 3 values; `result` is False**
