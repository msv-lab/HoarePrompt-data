Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least one more character, and `c` is the next character in `s`. If `c` is not present in `memo`, then `memo[c]` is set to 0, ensuring that `c` is initialized in `memo`. If `c` is already in `memo`, no changes are made to its value.***
