The variable `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` was not previously present in `memo`, it was initialized to 0, and now it will be 1 after the increment. If `c` was already in `memo`, its previous value is increased by 1. The variable `w` remains unchanged as it is a string, and `s` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `memo[c]`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least one more character, `memo[c]` is updated to its previous value plus 1**
