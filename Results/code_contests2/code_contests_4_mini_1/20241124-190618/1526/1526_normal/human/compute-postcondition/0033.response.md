The code prints 'Yes' if `result` is True and 'No' if `result` is False. The execution of the print statement depends on the value of `result`. 

Since the initial state specifies how `result` is determined based on the contents of `memo`, we analyze:

- If `memo` is a non-empty dictionary, `result` will be set to False if any value in `memo.values()` is odd; otherwise, `result` remains True.
- If `memo` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `result` remains True.

Given that the initial state indicates `memo` is non-empty or empty, we cannot determine the exact state of `result` without knowing the contents of `memo`. Hence, we can conclude:

If `memo` has odd values, `result` is set to False, leading to the output 'No'. If `memo` has only even values, `result` is True, leading to the output 'Yes'. If `memo` is empty, `result` is also True.

However, since we do not have the concrete values of `memo`, we cannot specify the exact value of `result`. 

Output State: **`memo` is a non-empty dictionary or empty; `result` is either True or False based on the values in `memo`, and the output will be either 'Yes' or 'No'.**
