The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `memo` is a non-empty dictionary with at least 2 values, `result` is False, `x` is the second value in `memo.values()`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
