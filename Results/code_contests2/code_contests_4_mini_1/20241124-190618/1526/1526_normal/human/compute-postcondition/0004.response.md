The code assigns the value `0` to the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. Since `c` is not a key in `memo` initially, it is added to the dictionary with the value of `0`. The other variables (`w`, `s`, and `c`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `0`, and `c` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `0`, and `c` is the first character of `s**
