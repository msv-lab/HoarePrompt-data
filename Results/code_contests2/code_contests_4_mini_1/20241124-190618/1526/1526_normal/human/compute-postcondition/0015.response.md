According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more characters left in the string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 2 characters, and the loop variable `c` will represent the next character in `s`. 

To determine the exact states that need to be adjusted:

1. Since `s` has at least 2 characters, we need to ensure that the loop variable `c` is set to the next character in `s`. If the loop has executed once already, `c` would have been the first character in `s`, so for the next iteration, `c` should be the second character in `s`. 

2. The value of `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1, so there will be no additional adjustments needed for `memo[c]`.

3. The string `s` itself does not change during the iterations, and since it has at least 2 characters, it is sufficient for the loop to execute again.

To summarize, the only changes necessary are to ensure that `c` points to the next character in `s`, which means it should be updated to represent a character at index 1 (the second character) if it was at index 0 (the first character) during the last iteration.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in `s`, and `memo[c]` is updated to its previous value plus 1**
