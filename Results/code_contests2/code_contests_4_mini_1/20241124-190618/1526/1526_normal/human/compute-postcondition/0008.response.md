The code assigns the value `0` to `memo[c]`. The previous value associated with `c` in `memo` is incremented by 1, but since the line of code resets `memo[c]` to `0`, the incremented value is lost. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `memo` but does not indicate the previous value that was incremented.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least one more character, `c` is the next character in `s`, and `memo[c]` is set to 0**
