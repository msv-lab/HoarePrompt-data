The code assigns `False` to `result`. The previous value of `result` is based on the second value in `memo.values()`, but it is overwritten by `False`. The variable `x` remains the same, as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `memo` is a non-empty dictionary with at least 2 values, `result` is False, and `x` is the second value in `memo.values()`.

Output State: **`memo` is a non-empty dictionary with at least 2 values, `result` is False, `x` is the second value in `memo.values()`**
