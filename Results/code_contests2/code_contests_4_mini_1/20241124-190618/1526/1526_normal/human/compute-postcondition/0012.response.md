The code assigns the value `0` to `memo[c]`. The previous value of `memo[c]` was updated to its previous value plus 1 before this assignment, but this new assignment will overwrite it to `0`. The variables `w` and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least two characters, `memo[c]` is set to 0.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least two characters, `memo[c]` is set to 0**
