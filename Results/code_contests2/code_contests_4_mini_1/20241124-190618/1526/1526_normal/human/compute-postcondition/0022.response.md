Postcondition: ***`memo` is a non-empty dictionary, `result` is set to False if `x`, the first value in `memo.values()`, is an odd integer; otherwise, `result` remains True. The program may break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the condition is met, ensuring that the overall state reflects whether `x` is even or odd.***
