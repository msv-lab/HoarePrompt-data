Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input, counts the frequency of each character, and checks if all character counts are even. It prints 'Yes' if all counts are even and 'No' if any count is odd. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Edge cases include handling an empty input string, which results in 'Yes' being printed since there are no odd frequencies. **
