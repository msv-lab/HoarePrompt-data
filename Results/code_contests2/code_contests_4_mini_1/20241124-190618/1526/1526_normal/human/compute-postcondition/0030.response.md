Postcondition: ***`memo` is a non-empty dictionary with at least 3 values. If `x` is an odd integer (i.e., `x % 2 > 0`), then `result` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x` is an even integer, there are no changes to `result` or `memo` as the condition is not met.***
