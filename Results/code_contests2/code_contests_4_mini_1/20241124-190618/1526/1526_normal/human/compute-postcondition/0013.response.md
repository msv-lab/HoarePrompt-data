Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least two characters, and `memo[c]` is updated to its previous value plus 1. If `c` is not already in `memo`, it is initialized to 0, indicating that it had not been counted previously. Otherwise, `memo[c]` retains its current value, reflecting that `c` was already present in the dictionary.***
