The code increments the value associated with the key `c` in the dictionary `memo` by 1. If `c` is not already present in `memo`, it was added with a value of 0 before this operation, so the value will become 1. If `c` was already present in `memo`, its previous value is increased by 1. The variable `w` and the string `s` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and the value associated with `c` in `memo` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and the value associated with `c` in `memo` is incremented by 1**
