According to the code, the loop iterates over the values in the dictionary `memo`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more value in `memo` to iterate over after the current iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary with at least 2 values. Since `x` is the second value in `memo.values()`, we conclude that the first value has already been processed in the previous iteration. 

To execute one more time, we need to ensure that the next value, which will become `x`, exists. Given that `x` was the second value, for the loop to continue, we need to have at least one more value (the third value) in `memo`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `memo` must have at least 3 values for the loop to execute again.

State: **`memo` is a non-empty dictionary with at least 3 values.**
