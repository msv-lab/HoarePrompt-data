According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least one more character, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least one more character than before, and `c` is currently the character being processed in that iteration. 

To execute one more time, we need to ensure that `c` is set to the next character in `s`. So, if `s` has at least two characters, after processing the current character, `c` would need to be updated to the next character in `s` and the length of `s` should still be maintained to ensure the loop condition remains valid.

Therefore, we adjust `s` to have at least two characters, `c` to the next character in `s`, which would mean `c` is the current character in the next iteration.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least two characters, `memo[c]` is updated to its previous value plus 1, `c` is the next character in the string `s`.**
