The variable `result` is assigned the value `False`. The initial value of `result` was `True`, but now it has been changed. The values of `memo` and `x` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `memo` is a non-empty dictionary, `result` is False, `x` is the first value in `memo.values()`, and `x` is an odd integer.

Output State: **`memo` is a non-empty dictionary, `result` is False, `x` is the first value in `memo.values()`, and `x` is an odd integer**
