To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem description, the code, and the output hints.

**Problem Description**:  
A string `w` is considered beautiful if each lowercase letter appears an even number of times.

**Program Code**:
```python
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        memo[c] += 1
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')
func_1()
```

**Output Hints**:  
The function accepts a string input, counts the frequency of each character, and checks if all character counts are even. It prints 'Yes' if all counts are even and 'No' if any count is odd. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Edge cases include handling an empty input string, which results in 'Yes' being printed since there are no odd frequencies.

**Initial Assessment**:  
1. The code reads input and creates a frequency dictionary (`memo`) to count occurrences of each character.
2. It then checks if all counts are even. If any count is odd, it sets `result` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
3. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if `result` is `True` (meaning all counts were even), and 'No' otherwise.

**Edge Cases**:  
- The code does not handle an empty input string since the constraints state `1 â‰¤ |w|`. Therefore, we're not concerned with empty strings.
- The code should work for all strings of lowercase letters with lengths between 1 and 100.

**Output Hints Evaluation**:  
The output hints correctly describe the functionality of the code. The hints state that if all character counts are even, 'Yes' is printed, and 'No' otherwise, which aligns with the code logic. The mention of edge cases regarding an empty string is not relevant due to the problem constraints.

**Conclusion**:  
The program meets the requirements of the problem description for all inputs within the specified constraints. The output hints align with the code's functionality and do not introduce any contradictions or overlooked edge cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code accurately counts the frequency of characters and checks for evenness as required by the problem description.
