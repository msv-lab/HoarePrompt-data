The function accepts multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` (size of the array) and a non-negative integer `k`, followed by an array of `n` non-negative integers. It computes and prints the sum of the largest element and the next `k` largest elements, adjusting `k` if necessary. If `k` is `0`, it only returns the largest element. If `t` is `0`, no output is produced. It does not handle invalid input cases.
