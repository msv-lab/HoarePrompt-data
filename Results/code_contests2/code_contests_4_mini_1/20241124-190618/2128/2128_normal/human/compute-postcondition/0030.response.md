The code assigns the value of `arr[l]` to be added to `ans`. Since `l` is 3, the value added to `ans` will be `arr[3]`. The states of the other variables are not affected directly by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated by adding `arr[3]`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `arr[3]`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3**
