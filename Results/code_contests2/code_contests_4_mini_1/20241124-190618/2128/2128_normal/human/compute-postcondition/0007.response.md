The variable `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Since `n` is given as an input integer, the value of `k` will be one less than the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `k` based on the initial value of `n`, while `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `ans` retain their previous states.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `a` is unchanged, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`**
