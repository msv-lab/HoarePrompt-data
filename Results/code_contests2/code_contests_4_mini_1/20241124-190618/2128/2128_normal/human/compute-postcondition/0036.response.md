The code assigns `arr` the value of a list created by mapping the input from `sys.stdin.readline().split()` to integers. The values of `n` and `k` are integers from input, but `arr` will contain the integers that are entered in a single line, separated by spaces. The initial values of `ans`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new variable `arr`, which contains the integer values from the input.

Output State: **`ans` remains unchanged, `i` is the current value plus 1, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, and `arr` is a list of integers from input.**
