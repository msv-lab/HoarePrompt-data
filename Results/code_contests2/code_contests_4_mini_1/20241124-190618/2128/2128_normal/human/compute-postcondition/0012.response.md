The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it. The variable `arr` remains sorted in descending order, and the value of `l` is assumed to be within the valid index range of `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state summarizes the relevant updates.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is at least 2, `a` remains unchanged, `arr` remains sorted in descending order, and `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[l]**
