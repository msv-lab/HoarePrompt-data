The variable `arr` is assigned the value of the sorted list of itself in descending order (due to `reverse=True`). The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged, and only the order of elements in `arr` is affected. The exact contents of `arr` depend on the input, but it will now be sorted from highest to lowest.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is unchanged, and `arr` is sorted in descending order.**
