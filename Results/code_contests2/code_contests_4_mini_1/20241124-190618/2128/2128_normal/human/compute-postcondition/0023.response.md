The value of `k` is assigned the result of `n - 1`. The initial state states that `n` is an input integer greater than 1, so `k` will be at least `1`. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `t`, `a`, and `arr`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the first element of `arr` which is sorted in descending order; `t` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `k` is at least 1; `a` remains unchanged; `arr` is now sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`ans` is the first element of `arr` which is sorted in descending order; `t` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `k` is at least 1; `a` remains unchanged; `arr` is now sorted in descending order**
