Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` (from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`) plus `arr[0]` if `k` is at least 1, or just `arr[0]` if `k` is 0; `t` is the initial input value (number of iterations); `i` is the current iteration index (0 to t-1); `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is bound by `n - 1`; `a` remains unchanged; `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order. If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `ans` is undefined as it is not printed.**
