The function `func` reads input values to process multiple test cases. It begins by reading an integer `t`, which indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (the size of an array) and `k` (the number of additional elements to sum), followed by an array of `n` integers. The function sorts this array in descending order and calculates the sum of the largest element (at index `0`) and the next `k` largest elements (from index `1` to `k`). If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it adjusts `k` to be `n - 1`. After computing the sum, it prints the result for each test case.

However, if `k` is `0`, only the largest element (`arr[0]`) is considered in the sum. The function does not handle cases where `t` is `0` gracefully, as it will not output anything in that case, leaving `ans` undefined. Additionally, the function assumes that valid inputs will be provided without any error handling for invalid entries.

Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` (size of the array) and a non-negative integer `k`, followed by an array of `n` non-negative integers. It computes and prints the sum of the largest element and the next `k` largest elements, adjusting `k` if necessary. If `k` is `0`, it only returns the largest element. If `t` is `0`, no output is produced. It does not handle invalid input cases. **
