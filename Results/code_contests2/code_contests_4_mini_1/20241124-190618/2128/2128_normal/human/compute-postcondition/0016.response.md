Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` starting from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` if `k` is at least 1. If `k` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains unchanged from its initial value, which is `arr[0]`. `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is bound by `n - 1` if `k` was originally greater than or equal to `n`, `a` remains unchanged, and `arr` remains sorted in descending order.**
