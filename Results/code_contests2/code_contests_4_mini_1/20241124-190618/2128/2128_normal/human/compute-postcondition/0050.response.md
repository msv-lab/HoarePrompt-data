According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `t`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` remains unchanged, and `t` also remains unchanged. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `t`. 

Since `i` remains unchanged, it is not specified what the value of `i` is, but the loop is currently on its last iteration if `i` is equal to `t - 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented, and it should be less than `t`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to `t` for the loop to stop executing.

State: **`ans` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to `t`, `t` remains unchanged**
