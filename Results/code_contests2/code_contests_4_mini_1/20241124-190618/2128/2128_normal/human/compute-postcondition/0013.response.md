According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `l` and the range defined by `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `k + 1`. Currently, `l` takes values starting from 1 up to `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `l` would have taken the value of 1 in the first iteration. Since the loop will execute until `l` reaches `k + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented to 2.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `l` is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is at least 2, `a` remains unchanged, `arr` remains sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[l]`, `l` is 2**
