According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the limit `t`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and if `ans` remains unchanged, it does not affect the loop execution. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop iterates until it reaches `t`, if `i` is currently at a value such that `i + 1` would still be less than `t`, `i` should be adjusted accordingly. If `i` is currently less than `t - 1`, then it will allow for another iteration. 

To conclude, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i` being incremented by 1.

State: **`ans` remains unchanged, `i` is the current value plus 1, `t` is unchanged**
