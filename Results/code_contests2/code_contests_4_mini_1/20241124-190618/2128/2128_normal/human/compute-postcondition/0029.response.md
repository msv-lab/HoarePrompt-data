According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and `k` is at least 2. To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `l` is incremented to 3, while `k` must be greater than or equal to 3 to allow for another iteration.

Thus, `k` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 3, and `l` should be incremented to 3.

State: **`ans` is updated by adding `arr[2]`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3**
