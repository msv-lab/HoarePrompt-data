According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l` and `k`. The loop iterates from `l = 1` to `l = k`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 3 and `k` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented to 4. Since `k` is at least 3, we need to adjust `k` to ensure it can accommodate `l = 4`. However, since `k` is at least 3, it indicates that `k` must be updated to at least 4 to allow for the loop to execute. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `ans`, `t`, `i`, and `n` do not affect the loop execution.

State: **`ans` is updated by adding `arr[3]`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is at least 4, `l` is 4**
