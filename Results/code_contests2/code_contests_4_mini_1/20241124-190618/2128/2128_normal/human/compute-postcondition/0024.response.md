Postcondition: ***`ans` is the first element of `arr` which is sorted in descending order; `t` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is set to `n - 1`, ensuring that `k` is always less than `n`. The variable `a` remains unchanged, and `arr` continues to be sorted in descending order.***
