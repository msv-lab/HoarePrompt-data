Postcondition: ***`ans` is the largest element in `arr`, `i` is the current value plus 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an integer from input, and `arr` is sorted in descending order. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is updated to `n - 1`. If `k` is less than `n`, its value remains unchanged.***
