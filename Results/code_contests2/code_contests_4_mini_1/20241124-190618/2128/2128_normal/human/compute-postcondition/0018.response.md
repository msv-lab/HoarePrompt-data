According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. Therefore, the conditions related to `i` and `t` must be adjusted.

State: **`ans` is either the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` if `k` is at least 1, or `arr[0]` if `k` is 0 or less; `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is bound by `n - 1`, `a` remains unchanged, and `arr` remains sorted in descending order.**
