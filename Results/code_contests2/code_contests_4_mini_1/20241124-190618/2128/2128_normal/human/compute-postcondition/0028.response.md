The value of `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`. Since `l` is 2, `arr[l]` refers to the value at index 2 of the `arr` array. The previous values of the affected variables are `ans`, which is updated, and `arr[l]`, whose specific value is unknown but will be added to `ans`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated by adding `arr[2]`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `arr[2]`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2**
