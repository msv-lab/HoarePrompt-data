According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `k + 1`, which means `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at all. Given that `k` is set to `n - 1` if it is greater than or equal to `n`, we need to ensure that `k` is less than `n` and greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute properly.

In the provided state:
- `ans` is the first element of `arr`
- `t` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1

To ensure the loop executes:
1. `k` must be at least 1, which can be guaranteed if `n` is greater than 2 (since `k = n - 1` must also be valid).
2. `k` must remain less than `n`, ensuring `k` is set correctly.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to confirm that `k` is at least 1 and less than `n`. 

State: **`ans` is the first element of `arr`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `n - 1` (which is at least 1 and less than `n`)**
