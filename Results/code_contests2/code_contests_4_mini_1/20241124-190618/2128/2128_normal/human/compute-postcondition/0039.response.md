The value of `k` is assigned the result of `n - 1`. Since `n` is an integer from input, the value of `k` will be one less than that input value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is assigned the value of the largest element in `arr`, `i` is the current value plus 1, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is `n - 1`, and `arr` is sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`ans` is assigned the value of the largest element in `arr`, `i` is the current value plus 1, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is `n - 1`, and `arr` is sorted in descending order**.
