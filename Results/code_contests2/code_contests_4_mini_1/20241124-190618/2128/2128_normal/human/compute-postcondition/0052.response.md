The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates under the constraints where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `k` is a non-negative integer. Additionally, it processes an array `a` containing `n` integers, where each integer \(a[i]\) is non-negative and satisfies \(0 \leq a[i] \leq 10^9\).

Based on the output derived from the function, it will handle multiple cases based on the parameters and the contents of the array. However, without explicit return points detailed, I will describe the general behavior based on the constraints provided.

Functionality: **The function processes an integer `t`, an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and an array `a` of `n` non-negative integers. It performs operations based on these inputs and returns results based on the specified constraints.**
