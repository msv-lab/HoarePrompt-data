Output State: **`ans` is either the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` if `k` is at least 1, or `arr[0]` if `k` is 0 or less; `t` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `k` is bound by `n - 1`; `a` remains unchanged; `arr` is now assigned a list of integers from input.**
