Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is set to `n - 1`; otherwise, `k` retains its original value. `arr` remains sorted in descending order, and `ans` is still assigned the value of `arr[0]`.***
