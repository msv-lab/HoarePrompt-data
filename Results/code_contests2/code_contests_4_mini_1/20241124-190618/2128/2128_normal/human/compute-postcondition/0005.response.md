The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted array `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` will be the largest element in the array. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is unchanged, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]**
