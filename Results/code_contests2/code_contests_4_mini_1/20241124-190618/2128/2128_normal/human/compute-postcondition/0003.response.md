The line of code creates a list called `arr` by reading a line of input, splitting it into separate values, and converting those values into integers. The state of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `a` is not affected by this operation. However, the value of `arr` will depend on the input provided during execution. 

Since `arr` is assigned the result of the input operation, the output state will include the unchanged values of the variables and indicate that `arr` has been created from the input integers.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is unchanged, and `arr` is a list of integers from input.**
