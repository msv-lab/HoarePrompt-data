The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[l]` will retrieve the element at index `l` of `arr`. The previous value of `ans` is the largest element of `arr`, and the value of `arr[l]` is known but not specified in the initial state. Therefore, after the execution, the state of `ans` will be updated to reflect this addition, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`, `k` is at least 1, and `n` is greater than 0**
