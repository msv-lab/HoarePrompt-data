The code sorts the list `arr` in descending order, but does not change the value of `ans`, `t`, `i`, `n`, or `k`. The previous values of `arr` are not specified, but after sorting, it will be arranged from the largest to the smallest value. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `arr` after sorting, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is updated to the sum of the largest `k` elements in `arr`, `t` is greater than the previous value, `i` is `t`, `n` and `k` are input integers**.
