The value of `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[l]` will be one of the elements in `arr`, and given that `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, the result will be `ans` increased by the value of `arr[l]`. The states of `t`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the largest element in `arr` increased by `arr[l]`; `t` is greater than the previous value; `i` is `t`; `k` is greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the largest element in `arr` increased by `arr[l]`; `t` is greater than the previous value; `i` is `t`; `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
