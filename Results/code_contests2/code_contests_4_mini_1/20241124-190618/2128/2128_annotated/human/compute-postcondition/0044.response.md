The code `ans += arr[l]` adds the value of `arr[l]` to `ans`. 

1. `ans` is the largest element in `arr` increased by `arr[2]`. 
2. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` is the largest element.
3. The value of `arr[l]` is not specified, but since `k` is greater than or equal to 1, it implies that `l` is a valid index within `arr` (assuming `l` is at least 0 and less than the length of `arr`).

Since `arr[l]` is added to `ans`, the exact new value of `ans` will depend on the specific value of `arr[l]`. However, we know that `ans` is modified by the addition of `arr[l]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`; `t` is greater than the previous value; `i` is `t`; `k` is greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`; `t` is greater than the previous value; `i` is `t`; `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
