The variable `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`. Given that `arr` is sorted in descending order and that `l` is `k + 1`, this means that we are accessing the next element in the array after `arr[k]`. 

The value of `ans` will increase by the value at index `l`, which is `arr[k + 1]`. The values of `arr`, `k`, and `n` are not directly affected, but the state of `ans` will change. 

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`, `k` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is k + 1**
