The code sorts the list `arr` in descending order. The initial state mentions that `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, but the specific values of `arr` are not provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change made to `arr` without specific values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, and `arr` is sorted in descending order**
