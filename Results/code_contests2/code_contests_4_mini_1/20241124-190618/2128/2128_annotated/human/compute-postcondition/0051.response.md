Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the largest `k` elements from the sorted array `arr`, including the largest element `arr[0]`. If `k` is 0, `ans` is equal to `arr[0]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is set to `n - 1`, and then `ans` includes elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`. If `n` is less than 2 and `k` is 0, the function prints `ans` as `arr[0]`, which is the only element. If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no value of `ans` is printed. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop will adjust `k` to `n - 1`, but since it will still execute. The output is printed for each iteration of `t`, giving a final `ans` for each respective input set.**
