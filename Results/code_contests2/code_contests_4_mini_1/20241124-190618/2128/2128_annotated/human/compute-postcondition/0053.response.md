The function `func` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (the number of elements in an array) and `k` (the number of largest elements to sum). It then reads an array of `n` integers, sorts it in descending order, and calculates the sum of the largest `k` elements from this sorted array. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it is adjusted to `n - 1`, ensuring the function does not attempt to sum more elements than are present in the array. The sum is printed for each test case.

Edge cases include:
- If `k` is 0, the function only returns the largest element, which is `arr[0]`.
- If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, the function still sums from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` after adjusting `k`, which will not lead to an index error due to the prior adjustments.
- If `t` is 0, no output is produced as the loop does not execute.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `t` and for each test case reads integers `n` and `k`, along with a list of integers, then computes and prints the sum of the largest `k` elements from the list, adjusting `k` as necessary to ensure valid indexing. **
