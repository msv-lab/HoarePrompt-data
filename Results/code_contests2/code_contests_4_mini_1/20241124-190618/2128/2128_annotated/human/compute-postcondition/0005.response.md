The value of `ans` is assigned the first element of the sorted array `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` is the largest element in the array. The values of other variables, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment to `ans` from `arr[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]**.
