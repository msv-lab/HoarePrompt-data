Output State: **`ans` is updated to the sum of the largest `k` elements in `arr`, where `arr` is sorted in descending order. If `k` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop executes `n - 1` times, and `ans` includes elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[n-1]`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop executes `k` times, and `ans` includes elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`.**
