The code assigns values to `n` and `k` by reading from standard input and splitting the input string into two parts, converting them to integers. The previous value of `ans` remains unchanged, and the values of `i` and `t` are not affected directly by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `n` and `k` from input, while the other variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`, or `arr[0]` if `k` is 0 or `n` is less than 2; the function prints `ans`, `i` is its previous value plus 1, `t` is greater than `i`; `n` and `k` are assigned values from input**
