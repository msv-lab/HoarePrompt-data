The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[l]` will be some value from the array. The previous values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, and `k`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans` after the addition.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`; `t` is greater than the previous value; `i` is `t`; `k` is greater than or equal to 2**
