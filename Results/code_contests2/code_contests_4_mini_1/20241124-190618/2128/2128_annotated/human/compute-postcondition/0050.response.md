According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` as `t`, meaning the loop has finished its execution since `i` is not less than `t` anymore. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `t + 1`, and `t` must be adjusted to be greater than its previous value. Therefore, the necessary adjustments are that `i` should be `t + 1` and `t` needs to be greater than its previous value.

State: **`ans` is the sum of the largest element in `arr` and the first `k` elements in `arr`, `arr` remains sorted in descending order, `t` is greater than the previous value, `i` is `t + 1`, and `k` is at least 1**
