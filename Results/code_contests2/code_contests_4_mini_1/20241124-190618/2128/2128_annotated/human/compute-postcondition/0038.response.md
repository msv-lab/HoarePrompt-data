The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the array `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` is the largest element in `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans` based on the largest element in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, `t` is greater than the previous value, `i` is `t`, `n` and `k` are input integers**
