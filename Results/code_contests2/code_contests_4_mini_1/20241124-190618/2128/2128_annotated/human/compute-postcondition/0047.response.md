According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 (the starting point of the loop), and `k` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to 2 (the next value in the range). Since `k` is already greater than or equal to 2, it will still allow the loop to execute at least once more.

State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`, `t` is greater than the previous value, `i` is `t`, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `l` is 2**
