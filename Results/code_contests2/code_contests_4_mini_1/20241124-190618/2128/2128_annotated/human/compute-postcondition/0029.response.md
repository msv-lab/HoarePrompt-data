According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `l` and the range defined by `k`. The loop will run as long as `l` is within the range from 1 to `k + 1`, meaning it can execute when `l` is less than or equal to `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `l` is equal to `k + 1`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be set back to 1, and `k` must be at least 1 to satisfy the condition for the for loop. Since `l` is already set to `k + 1`, we need to adjust it back to 1.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `l` needs to be set back to 1
- `k` must remain at least 1 to allow the loop to run.

State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[1]`, `k` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 1**
