The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `sys.stdin.readline()` and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The previous values of `t` and `i` are not affected by this operation. The value of `t` is within the specified bounds (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000), and `i` remains 0. The output state reflects the unchanged values of `t` and `i`, while `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers**
