The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The previous values of `ans`, `t`, and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same for the variables other than `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the sum of the largest `k` elements in `arr`, where `arr` is sorted in descending order; `t` is greater than the previous value; `i` is `t`; `n` and `k` are input integers.**
