According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. The loop will iterate from `1` to `k`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented to 2, and we need to ensure that `k` is at least 2 so that the loop can continue.

Thus, the adjusted states should reflect that `l` is now 2 and `k` is at least 2.

State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`, where `l` is 2, `k` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 0**
