The value of `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`, where `arr` is sorted in descending order and `l` is an index that refers to an element in `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[l]` is a valid element. The previous value of `ans` is not specified, but we know that it will increase by the value of `arr[l]`. Other variables such as `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`, `k` is at least 2**
