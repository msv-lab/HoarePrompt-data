Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is updated to `n - 1`, ensuring that `k` remains within valid bounds (0 to n-1). If `k` is already less than `n`, it remains unchanged. In either case, `k` does not exceed `n - 1`.***
