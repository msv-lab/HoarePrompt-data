The value of `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`. Since `l` is 1, `arr[l]` refers to the second element of the `arr` array. The previous state indicates that `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `k` is at least 1 while `n` is greater than 0. This means that `arr[1]` is a valid index and will contribute positively to `ans`. The exact new value of `ans` cannot be determined without the specific values in `arr`, but it is clear that `ans` increases by the value of `arr[1]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`, where `l` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`, where `l` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0**
