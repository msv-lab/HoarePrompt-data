The variable `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Given that `n` is an input integer, the value of `k` will be equal to `n - 1`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the modification of `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]**
