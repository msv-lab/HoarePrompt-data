The variable `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Since `n` is an input integer, the specific value of `k` will depend on the value of `n`. The other variables `arr`, `ans`, `t`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the condition of the variables after the assignment.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the largest element in `arr`; `t` is greater than the previous value; `i` is `t`; `k` is `n - 1`**
