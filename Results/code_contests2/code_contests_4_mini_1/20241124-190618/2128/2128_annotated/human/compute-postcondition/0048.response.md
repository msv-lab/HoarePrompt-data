Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the largest element in `arr` and the first `k` elements in `arr` (from index 1 to k), `arr` remains sorted in descending order, `t` is greater than the previous value, `i` is `t`, and `k` is at least 1. If `k` is less than 1 (in which case the loop does not execute), `ans` remains unchanged from its initial value, and `arr` is still sorted in descending order. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop executes up to `n-1`. If `k` is less than `n`, it executes up to `k`.**
