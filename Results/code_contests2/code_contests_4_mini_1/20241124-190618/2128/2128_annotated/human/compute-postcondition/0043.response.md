According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `k + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 (the first value in the range), and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be incremented to 2 in the next iteration. 

Since `k` is greater than or equal to 1, it ensures that there exists at least one more iteration where `l` can take the value of 2. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `l`, which should be 2.

State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the largest element in `arr` increased by `arr[2]`; `t` is greater than the previous value; `i` is `t`; `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
