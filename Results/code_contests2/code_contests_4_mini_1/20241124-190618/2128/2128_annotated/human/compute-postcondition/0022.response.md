`ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted array in descending order. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` will be the largest element of the array. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the largest element of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the largest element of `arr`**
