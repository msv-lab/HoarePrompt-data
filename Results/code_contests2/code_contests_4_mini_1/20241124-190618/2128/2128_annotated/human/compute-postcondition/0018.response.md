According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value (not given) and `t` is a variable that determines how many times the loop will run.

Since there is no specific information about the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, we can only assume that it is less than `t` for the loop to run one more time. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be one greater than its previous value. 

Additionally, `t` needs to be at least one more than the current value of `i` for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`ans` is the sum of `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`, or `arr[0]` if `k` is 0 or `n` is less than 2; the function prints `ans`, `i` is its previous value plus 1, `t` is greater than `i`.**
