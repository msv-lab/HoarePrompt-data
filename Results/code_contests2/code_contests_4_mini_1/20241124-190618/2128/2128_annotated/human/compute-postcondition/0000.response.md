The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, where `sys.stdin.readline()` reads a line from standard input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `a` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n` ≤ 200000, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9 for each `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n` ≤ 200000, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9 for each `i`.**
