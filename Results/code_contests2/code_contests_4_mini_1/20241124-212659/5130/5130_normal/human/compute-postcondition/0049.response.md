Output State: **`if comps[p[j]]` is 0, then `comps[j]` will be updated to `col` and `j` will continue to update to `p[j]` until `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0. At the end of the loop, if it executes, `comps[j]` is equal to `col`, and `j` is the last value before `comps[p[j]]` became non-zero. If `comps[p[j]]` is not 0 before the loop starts, then the loop will not execute, and `comps` and `j` will remain unchanged.**
