Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,001), `i` is incremented by 1, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1, `b` is a list of integers parsed from input values, `comps` is a list of integers initialized to zero, and `col` is incremented by 1. If `comps[i]` was 0 before execution, then `col` is assigned to `comps[i]`, `j` is set to `i`, and `comps[j]` is updated to `col` for each subsequent index following the mapping in `p` until a non-zero value is encountered in `comps`. If `comps[i]` was not 0, `comps` and `j` remain unchanged. Thus, `comps` reflects the update based on `col` for all indices reached by the mapping in `p` starting from `i` if `comps[i]` was initially 0.***
