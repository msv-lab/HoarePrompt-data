Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,001), `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1, `b` is a list of integers parsed from input values, `comps` is a list of integers initialized to zero, and `col` is incremented by 1. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `col` is incremented and `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The loop continues to update `comps` with the value of `col` for each index referenced by `p[j]` until it encounters an index where `comps[p[j]]` is non-zero. If `comps[i]` is non-zero at the start, then `comps` remains unchanged, and the initial values are retained. After execution, `j` will hold the last index processed, and `col` will reflect the total increments made during the loop.***
