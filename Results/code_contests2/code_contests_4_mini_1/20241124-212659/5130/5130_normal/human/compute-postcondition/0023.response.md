The line `comps[i] = col` assigns the value of `col` to the index `i` in the list `comps`. The variable `col` has been increased by 1 prior to this assignment, but without additional information on the current value of `i`, we cannot determine the exact changes to the `comps` list. 

The initial state indicates that `comps` is a list initialized to zero, so after the assignment, `comps[i]` will be equal to the current value of `col`. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,001), `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1, `b` is a list of integers parsed from input values, `comps` is updated at index `i` to the value of `col`, and `col` has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,001), `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1, `b` is a list of integers parsed from input values, `comps[i]` is equal to `col`, and `col` has been increased by 1**
