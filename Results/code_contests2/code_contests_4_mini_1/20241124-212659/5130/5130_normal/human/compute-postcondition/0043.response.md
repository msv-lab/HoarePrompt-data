The value of `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`. Since `p[j]` is assigned to `j` based on the updated value of `j` from `p`, we do not have specific values for `p[j]` or `j` in the initial state. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,001), `i` is incremented by 1, `p[j]` is assigned to `j`, `comps[p[j]]` remains equal to 0, and `j` is updated to `p[j]`**.
