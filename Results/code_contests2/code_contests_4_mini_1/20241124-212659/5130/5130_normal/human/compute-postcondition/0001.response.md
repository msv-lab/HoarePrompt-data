The variable `p` is assigned the value of a list comprehension that processes the input from `raw_input()`. The input consists of a space-separated string of integers, which are converted to integers, and then each integer is decremented by 1. The initial value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, indicating the length of the list `p`. Since `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, it will contain unique integers ranging from `0` to `n-1` after the transformation.

Thus, the output state reflects the transformation of `p` based on the input values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1 based on input values.**
