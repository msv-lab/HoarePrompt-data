The variable `col` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `b`, and `comps`) remain unchanged as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1; `b` is a list of integers parsed from input values; `comps` is a list of n zeros; `col` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1; `b` is a list of integers parsed from input values; `comps` is a list of n zeros; `col` is 0**
