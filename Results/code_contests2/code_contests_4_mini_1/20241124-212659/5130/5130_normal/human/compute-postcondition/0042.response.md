To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the loop condition `while comps[p[j]] == 0:`. For the loop to execute again, the condition must be true, meaning that `comps[p[j]]` should still be equal to 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,001), `i` is incremented by 1, `p[j]` is assigned to `j` based on the updated value of `j` from `p`, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.

1. **Variable Analysis**:
   - Since `comps[p[j]]` must equal 0 for the loop to continue, we note that the value of `comps[p[j]]` must not have changed from 0 at the end of the last iteration. 

2. **Updating States**:
   - The variable `j` may have been updated in the previous loop iteration, and we need to ensure that `p[j]` is still pointing to an index in `comps` where the value remains 0.
   - Therefore, we should ensure that `comps[p[j]]` is still 0 after the previous iteration, which means we need to maintain the state of `comps` such that `comps[p[j]]` remains 0 after indexing.

Since no specific alterations to `j`, `p`, or `comps` have been explicitly provided in the task that would change the condition for the loop, and since we need to ensure the loop can execute one more time without altering any given states unnecessarily:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,001), `i` is incremented by 1, `p[j]` is assigned to `j` based on the updated value of `j` from `p`, and `comps[p[j]]` remains equal to 0**
