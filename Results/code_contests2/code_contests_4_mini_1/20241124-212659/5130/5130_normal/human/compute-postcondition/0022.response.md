The value of `col` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `col` is unknown. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,001), `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1, `b` is a list of integers parsed from input values, `comps` is a list of integers initialized to zero, and `col` is increased by 1.
