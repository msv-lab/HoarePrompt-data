According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. For the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`. If `col` is not equal to 0, then `comps[p[j]]` cannot be 0, and the loop will not execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `col` is set to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,001), `i` is incremented by 1, `p[j]` is assigned to `j`, `comps[p[j]]` remains equal to 0, `j` is updated to `p[j]`, and `col` is equal to 0**
