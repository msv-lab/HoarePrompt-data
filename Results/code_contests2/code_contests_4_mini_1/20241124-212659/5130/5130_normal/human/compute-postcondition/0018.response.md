According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `comps[p[j]]`. If `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `comps` at index `j` is set to 1, which means that `comps[p[j]]` is not equal to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1, `b` is a list of integers parsed from input values, `comps` at index `j` is set to 0, `col` is 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is updated to `p[j]`**
