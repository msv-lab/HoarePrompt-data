To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given information about the variables and their conditions.

1. The loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
2. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`, which is a positive integer between 2 and 200,001.
3. After the last iteration, `i` has already been incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` will determine if the loop continues.
4. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n` at the start of the next iteration.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration has `i` incremented by 1, we can assume that `i` is now equal to its previous value plus one (i.e., `i + 1`). 

Thus, for the loop to execute again:
- We need to ensure that the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) is still less than `n`.

Therefore, the state can be modified as follows:
- `i` needs to be updated to `i + 1` (the current value after the increment).
- The condition for `n` will remain the same, but we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `i + 1` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,001), `i` is the current value + 1, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1, `b` is a list of integers parsed from input values, `comps` is a list of integers initialized to zero, and `col` is the current value + 1, if `comps[i]` was 0 before execution, then `col` is assigned to `comps[i]`, `j` is set to `i`, and `comps[j]` is updated to `col` for each subsequent index following the mapping in `p` until a non-zero value is encountered in `comps`. If `comps[i]` was not 0, `comps` and `j` remain unchanged. Thus, `comps` reflects the update based on `col` for all indices reached by the mapping in `p` starting from `i` if `comps[i]` was initially 0, and `i` is less than `n`**.
