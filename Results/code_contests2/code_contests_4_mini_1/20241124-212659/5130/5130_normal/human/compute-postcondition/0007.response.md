The value of `col` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `col` is 0, so after the execution, `col` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1, `b` is a list of integers parsed from input values, `comps` is a list of n zeros, `col` is 1, `i` is 0, and the `i`-th element of `comps` is 0.
