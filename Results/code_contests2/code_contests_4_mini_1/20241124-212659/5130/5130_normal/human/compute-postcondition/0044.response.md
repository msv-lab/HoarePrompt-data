The variable `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `j` has been updated to `p[j]`, and the previous state of `comps[p[j]]` is 0, indicating that `comps` was initially not changed for the new index `j`. However, now, `comps[j]` will take the value of `col`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `comps`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,001), `i` is incremented by 1, `p[j]` is assigned to `j`, `comps[p[j]]` remains equal to 0, `j` is updated to `p[j]`, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
