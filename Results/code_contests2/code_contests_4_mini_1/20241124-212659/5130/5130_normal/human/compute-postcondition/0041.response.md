The variable `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The previous values of `comps` and `col` are not specified, and the state of `j` is also not provided. However, it's clear that `comps[j]` is updated with a new value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,001), `i` is incremented by 1, `p[j]` is assigned to `j` based on the updated value of `j` from `p`, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,001), `i` is incremented by 1, `p[j]` is assigned to `j` based on the updated value of `j` from `p`, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`**
