The variable `b` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means it will contain a list of integers parsed from a space-separated string input. The initial state specifies that `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1 based on the input values, and `n` is a positive integer. The variable `b` will thus reflect the integers provided via input. The exact values of `b` will depend on the input received but will be a list of integers. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1 based on input values; `b` is a list of integers parsed from input values.**
