Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1, `b` is a list of integers parsed from input values, `comps` is a list of integers where indices corresponding to visited nodes in the graph represented by `p` are assigned values from 1 to `col`, `col` is the number of distinct components identified. The output will be determined by evaluating `print(0 if col == 1 else col) + (1 if sum(b) == 0 else 0)`, resulting in either `col` or `0` depending on the value of `col`, and potentially incrementing by `1` if the sum of `b` is `0`.**
