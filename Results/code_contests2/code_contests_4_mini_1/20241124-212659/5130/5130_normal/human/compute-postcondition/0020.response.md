Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1, `b` is a list of integers parsed from input values, `comps` is a list of integers initialized to zero, `col` is incremented by 1, and if `comps[i]` was 0, then `comps` will have the elements at indices corresponding to the traversal of `p` starting from `i` updated to `col`, indicating that those indices have been visited. If there is a cycle in the `p` list, the loop may run indefinitely, but if no cycle exists and `comps` is updated, `col` will reflect the number of distinct components visited during this operation. If `comps[i]` was already 1 before execution, `comps` remains unchanged, `col` remains the same, and no updates are made to `j` other than its initial value.***
