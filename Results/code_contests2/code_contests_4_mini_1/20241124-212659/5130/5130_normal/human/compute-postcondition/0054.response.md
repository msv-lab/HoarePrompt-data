The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. 

- `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. 
- `p` is a list of integers that represents a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with a length of `n`.

The function does not return a value explicitly described in the provided output, so we will focus on the parameters and their constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` which is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones with length `n`.**
