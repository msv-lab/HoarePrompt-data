According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `comps[p[j]]` must still be equal to 0 at the end of the last iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `comps[i]` was equal to `col`, and `col` has been increased by 1, which means the value of `comps[p[j]]` may have been set to `col` during the last iteration. Since `comps[j]` is assigned the updated value of `col`, for the while loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` must still be 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `col` has not reached the value that assigns a non-zero value to `comps[p[j]]`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `col` must still be less than whatever value would make `comps[p[j]]` non-zero.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,001), `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1, `b` is a list of integers parsed from input values, `comps[i]` is equal to `col`, `col` is less than the value that would make `comps[p[j]]` non-zero, `j` has been updated to the value at index `j` in the list `p`, and `comps[j]` is assigned the updated value of `col`.**
