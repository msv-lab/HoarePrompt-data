The function `func` accepts two parameters: `p` and `b`. The parameter `p` is a list of integers that represents a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The parameter `b` is a list of integers consisting of 0s and 1s, with a length equal to `n`. 

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values in these lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `p` which is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to n, and a list `b` consisting of 0s and 1s, and returns a result based on the provided lists.**
