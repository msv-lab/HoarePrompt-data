The statement `b = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer. The existing list `b` will be overwritten by the new list of integers generated from the input. The initial state of `b` will change based on the input provided. Other variables, `n` and `p`, remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers generated from user input.**
