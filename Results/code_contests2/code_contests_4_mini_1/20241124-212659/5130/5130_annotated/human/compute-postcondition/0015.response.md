According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `comps` and the value of `p[j]`. The loop will execute as long as `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[0]` is set to 1, but we do not have information about `comps[p[j]]` since `j` is currently 0 and `p[j]` equals 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0, which is not the case as `comps[0]` is set to 1. Therefore, we need to set `comps[p[j]]` back to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers generated from user input, `comps` is a list of integers with `comps[0]` set to 0, `col` is 1, `j` is 0**
