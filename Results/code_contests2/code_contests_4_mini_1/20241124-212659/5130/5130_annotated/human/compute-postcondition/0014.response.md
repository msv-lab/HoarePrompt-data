The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The initial state shows that `j` is 0, so `comps[0]` is updated to the value of `col`, which is 1. Therefore, after execution, `comps[0]` will remain 1, and the states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers generated from user input, `comps` is a list of integers with `comps[0]` set to 1, `col` is 1, `j` is 0**
