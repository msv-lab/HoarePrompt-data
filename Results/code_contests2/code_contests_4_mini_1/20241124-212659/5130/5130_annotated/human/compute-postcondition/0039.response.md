The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `b`, `comps`, and `col`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers generated from user input, `comps` is a list of integers with length `n` where `comps[2]` is now 1, `col` is 1, and `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers generated from user input, `comps` is a list of integers with length `n` where `comps[2]` is now 1, `col` is 1, and `j` is 2**
