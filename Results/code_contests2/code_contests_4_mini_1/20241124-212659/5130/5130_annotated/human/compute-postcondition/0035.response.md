Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers generated from user input, `comps` is a list of integers with length `n` initialized to 0, and `col` is 0. If `comps[i]` is 0, `col` is increased by 1, and `comps[i]` is set to `col`. The index `j` is then updated through the chain defined by `p`, setting `comps[j]` to `col` for each index until it reaches an index where `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0. If `comps[i]` is already non-zero before entering the if block, there will be no changes to `comps` and `col`. Edge cases such as cycles in `p` or out-of-bounds indices should be handled to prevent infinite loops or errors.***
