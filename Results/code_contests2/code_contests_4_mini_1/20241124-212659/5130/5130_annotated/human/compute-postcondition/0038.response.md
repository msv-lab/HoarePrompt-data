The value of `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, where `i` is 2 and `col` is 1. Thus, `comps[2]` is set to 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `b`, and `col`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers generated from user input, `comps` is a list of integers with length `n` where `comps[2]` is now 1, and `col` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers generated from user input, `comps` is a list of integers with length `n` where `comps[2]` is now 1, and `col` is 1**
