Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers generated from user input, `comps` is a list of integers with length `n` and all initialized to 0, and `col` is 0. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is updated to the new value of `col`, and `j` is initialized to `i`. The while loop continues to update `comps[p[j]]` to `col` as long as `comps[p[j]]` remains 0. The loop will terminate when `comps[p[j]]` becomes non-zero, preventing infinite loops if any index loops back. If `comps[i]` is initially non-zero, `comps` remains unchanged, and `col` remains 0.***
