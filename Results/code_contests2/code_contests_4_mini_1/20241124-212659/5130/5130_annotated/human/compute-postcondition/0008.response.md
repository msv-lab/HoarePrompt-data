The value of `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. Given that `i` is 0 and `col` is 1, `comps[0]` is updated to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers generated from user input, `comps` is a list of integers with length `n` and all initialized to 0, `col` is 1, and `comps[0]` is 1.
