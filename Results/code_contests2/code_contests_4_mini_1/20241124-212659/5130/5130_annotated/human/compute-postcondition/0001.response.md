The value of `p` is assigned as a list comprehension that processes the input from `raw_input()`, splitting the input string and converting each value to an integer, subtracting 1 from each value. Since `p` represents a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, the values will range from 0 to `n-1` after the subtraction. The previous value of `n` remains unchanged, and the list `b` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of 0s and 1s with a length of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of 0s and 1s with a length of `n`**
