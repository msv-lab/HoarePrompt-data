The statement assigns the value of `col` (which is 1) to `comps[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `comps[1]` will now be set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers generated from user input, `comps` is a list of integers with length `n` and all initialized to 0 (except for `comps[1]` which is now 1), and `col` is 1.
