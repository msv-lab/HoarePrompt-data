The variable `col` is initialized to 0, and all other variables remain unchanged. The states of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `b`, and `comps`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers generated from user input; `comps` is a list of integers with length `n`, all initialized to 0; `col` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers generated from user input; `comps` is a list of integers with length `n`, all initialized to 0; `col` is 0**
