Output State: **`if comps[p[j]] is 0 then comps[j]` is set to `col` and `j` is updated to `p[j]`. The loop continues until `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0. If `comps[p[j]]` is already 1 (or any non-zero value) when the loop starts, it does not execute, and `j` remains 2 with `comps[2]` still being 1. If `j` reaches a point where `comps[j]` is set, the loop exits, leaving `comps` updated for all indices visited through `p`.**
