The variable `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The previous value of `j` is 0, and `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, meaning `p[0]` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `j` remains 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list of integers generated from user input, `comps` is a list of integers initialized to 1 at index 0, `col` is 1, `j` is 0**
