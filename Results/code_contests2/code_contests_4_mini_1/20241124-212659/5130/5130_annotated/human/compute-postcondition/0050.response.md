Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is a list generated from user input, `comps` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with length `n`, and `col` is an integer representing the current color. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `col` is incremented by 1 and `comps[i]` is set to `col`, followed by updating `comps[j]` to `col` for each index `j` traversed in `p` until `comps[p[j]]` is not 0. If `comps[i]` is already non-zero, then `col` remains unchanged, and `comps` retains its original state. Additionally, `j` starts at 2 and may be updated during the loop, but it will remain 2 if the loop does not execute. The overall state of `comps` will reflect the updated colors for all indices visited through `p` starting from `i` if the condition is satisfied.***
