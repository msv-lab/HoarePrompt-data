The function `func_1` accepts parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. All parameters are integers representing the coordinates of two different cities. After executing the function body, it calculates and returns the distance between the two cities represented by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept integer coordinates for two cities and return the distance between them. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2, which are integers representing the coordinates of two cities, and it returns the distance between these two cities.**
