The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. All parameters are integers representing the coordinates of two cities. After executing the function body, it returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities represented by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept integer coordinates of two cities and return the Euclidean distance between them.

Functionality: **The function accepts integer parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2 representing the coordinates of two cities and returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities.**
