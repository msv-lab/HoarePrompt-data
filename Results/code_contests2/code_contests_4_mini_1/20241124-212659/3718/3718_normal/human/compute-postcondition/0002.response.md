Functionality: ** The function accepts four parameters (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of two points in a 2D space and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points. It does not handle any potential edge cases, such as non-numeric input or overflow errors. The function assumes that the input coordinates are valid numeric values (integers or floats). **
