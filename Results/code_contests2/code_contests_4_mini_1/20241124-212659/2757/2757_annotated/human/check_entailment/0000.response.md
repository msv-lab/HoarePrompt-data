The provided code snippet only includes a function `func_1` which checks if a character is a consonant or a vowel. However, it does not implement the main functionality required by the problem description, which is to identify and correct words that contain typos according to the specified rules.

The requirements state that a word contains a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row, with the exception being when all consonants are the same. The function provided does not address the detection of these patterns in an entire word nor does it implement the logic to insert spaces to break the word into valid segments.

Given this lack of functionality, the code is incorrect as it does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem statement. 

For example, if the input is "hellno", the function `func_1` will not provide any output related to fixing the typo; it merely checks if a character is a consonant. Therefore, the program fails to meet the criteria for correcting the input string.

Correctness: **False**
