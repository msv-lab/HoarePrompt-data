Functionality: ** The function accepts a single character `ch` and returns True if `ch` is a consonant (i.e., not a vowel), and False if `ch` is a vowel. It does not handle cases where `ch` is not a single alphabetical character, such as digits or special characters, which may lead to unexpected results, as it only checks for membership in the string 'aeiou'. **
