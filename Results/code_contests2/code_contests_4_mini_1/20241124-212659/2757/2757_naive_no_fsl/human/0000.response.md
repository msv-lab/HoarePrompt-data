To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles the detection of typos (consecutive consonants) and the insertion of spaces.

### Overview of the Code:

1. **Function `func_1(ch)`**: This function checks if a character is a consonant (returns `True` if it is not a vowel).
2. **Main Logic**:
   - It iterates through the string and checks for blocks of three or more consecutive consonants.
   - If it finds such a block where not all characters are the same, it tries to break it up by inserting spaces.
   - The way it writes the output may not correctly handle the cases when there are more than three consonants in a row, especially if the block starts or ends with consonants.

### Issues Identified:
- The code only checks three characters at a time (`s[i]`, `s[i + 1]`, `s[i + 2]`), and it does not properly handle longer blocks of consonants. For example, if there are four consonants in a row, the program may miss breaking them up correctly.
- The condition `(s[i] != s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] != s[i + 2])` is incorrect because it should ensure that there are at least two different consonant letters among the three being checked. The current logic can allow blocks of three identical consonants (e.g., "ppp") to pass without breaking.

### Test Case for Failure:
Consider the input string:
```
"hellloow"
```
This string has a sequence of "lll" which should be broken into "hel lloow". The program will incorrectly output:
```
hel lloow
```
This is incorrect because it has not handled the typo correctly; it should recognize that "lll" is not allowed.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to correctly address cases with longer blocks of consonants and improperly handles the logic when there are consecutive consonants, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
