According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that the loop was able to continue, and since `nums` has at least 2 elements, `len(nums)` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

To ensure the loop can continue, we need to adjust `i` to `i + 1`, and we must check the condition regarding `nums`. Since `nums` has at least 2 elements, we can conclude that `len(nums)` is at least 3 to allow for the next index to exist (since we are accessing `nums[i + 1]`).

State: **`nums` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the new index (previous `i` + 1)**
