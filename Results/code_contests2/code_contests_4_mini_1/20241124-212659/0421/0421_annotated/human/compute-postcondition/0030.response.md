The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, but since the previous value of `flag` is unchanged and the other variables are not affected, the output state reflects the unchanged nature of those variables. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and `flag` is False.

Output State: **`nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and `flag` is False**
