Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains unchanged.***
