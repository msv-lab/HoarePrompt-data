According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute again if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is True, indicating that all adjacent pairs of elements in `nums` have an absolute difference of less than 2. However, since `nums` has the maximum element removed, it is necessary for `nums` to still contain elements for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums` is not empty.

State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is not empty**
