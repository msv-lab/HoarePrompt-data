Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flag` is set to False if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains True, and the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement.***
