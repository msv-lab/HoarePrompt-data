According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will only execute if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. 

At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False, indicating that there exists at least one absolute difference between consecutive elements in `nums` that is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must be True. This means that the condition for `flag` needs to be adjusted such that there are no absolute differences between consecutive elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to 2.

Additionally, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, and after removing the maximum element, it contains one less element, which means it still has at least 1 element left.

Thus, the adjustment needed for the loop to execute one more time is to change `flag` to True. 

State: **`nums` is a list with at least 1 element, `flag` is True**
