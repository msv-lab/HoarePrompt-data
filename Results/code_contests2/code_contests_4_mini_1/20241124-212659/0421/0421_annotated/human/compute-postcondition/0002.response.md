The value of `nums` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input string (which is `n`), and `split()` breaks that string into individual components. Each component is then converted to an integer using `int`. Since `nums` is a list of integers, the output state will reflect the newly created list based on the input string. The other variables, `n` and `flag`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers created from the input string, `flag` is True**
