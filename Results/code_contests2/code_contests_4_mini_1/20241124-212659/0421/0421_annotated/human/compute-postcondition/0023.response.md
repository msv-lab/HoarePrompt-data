The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
