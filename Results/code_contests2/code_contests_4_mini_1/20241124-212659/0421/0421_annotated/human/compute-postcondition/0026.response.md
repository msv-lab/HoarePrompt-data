The value of `flag` is assigned to `False`. The previous value of `flag` was either `True` or `False`, but after this assignment, it is now `False`. The values of `nums` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, and `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, and `i` is incremented by 1**
