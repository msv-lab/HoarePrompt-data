The code assigns the value `False` to the variable `flag`. The previous values of `nums` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `flag` while keeping the state of `nums` and `i` unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the new index (previous `i` + 1), `flag` is False**
