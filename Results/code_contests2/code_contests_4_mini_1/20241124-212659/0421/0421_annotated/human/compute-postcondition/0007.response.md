Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `flag` is set to False if the absolute difference between `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` is greater than or equal to 2, causing a break from the most internal loop. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains True, and the program continues without interruption.***
