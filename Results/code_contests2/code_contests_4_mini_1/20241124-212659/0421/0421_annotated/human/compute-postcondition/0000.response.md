The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input as a string. Since `n` was previously an integer in the range 1 to 10, it will now be a string representation of whatever input is provided. The state of `nums` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string, and `nums` is a list of integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100.

Output State: **`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100**
