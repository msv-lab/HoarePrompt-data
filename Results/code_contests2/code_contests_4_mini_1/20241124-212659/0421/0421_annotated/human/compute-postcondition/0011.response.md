Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `flag` is set to False if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains True.***
