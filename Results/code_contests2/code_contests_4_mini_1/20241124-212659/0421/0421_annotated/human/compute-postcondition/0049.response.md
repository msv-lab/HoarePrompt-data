Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is equal to len(nums) - 2, and if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.***
