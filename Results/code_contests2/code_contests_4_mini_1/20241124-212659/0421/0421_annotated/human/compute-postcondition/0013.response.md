The value of `flag` is assigned the value `False`, but it was already `False`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is 2**
