Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` has been incremented by 1, and if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False, and the execution exits the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.***
