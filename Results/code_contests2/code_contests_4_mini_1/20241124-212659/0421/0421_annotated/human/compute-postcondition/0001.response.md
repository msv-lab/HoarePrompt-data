The variable `flag` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables, `n` and `nums`, are not affected. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100, and `flag` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100, and `flag` is True**
