According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, which means the loop will not execute again unless `i` is adjusted.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `len(nums)`, and since the loop condition is `i in xrange(len(nums) - 1)`, we also need to adjust that accordingly. 

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `i` is now equal to `len(nums)`, indicating that it is outside the range for the loop to execute.

State: **`nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is `len(nums)`, `flag` remains unchanged**
