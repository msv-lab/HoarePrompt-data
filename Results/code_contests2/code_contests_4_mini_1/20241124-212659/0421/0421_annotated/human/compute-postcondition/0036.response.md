According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `flag` must be True and `nums` must not be empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` can be either True or False based on the adjacent elements' absolute differences, and `nums` has at least 2 elements but has one less element after removing the maximum value. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `flag` needs to be True, and `nums` must have at least 1 element remaining after the maximum value is removed.

Since `nums` originally had at least 2 elements, after removing the maximum value, it will have at least 1 element. The condition for `flag` can be adjusted to ensure it is True.

State: **`nums` has at least 1 element; `flag` is True**
