According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. The loop will execute if `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1, which means that `len(nums)` must be at least 2. Given that `nums` is a list with at least 1 element, we can infer that for the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least 2 elements.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will start from 0, as it is the standard initialization for a loop counter in Python. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states accordingly. The state should indicate that `nums` has at least 2 elements (to ensure the loop executes), and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flag` is True, `i` is 0**
