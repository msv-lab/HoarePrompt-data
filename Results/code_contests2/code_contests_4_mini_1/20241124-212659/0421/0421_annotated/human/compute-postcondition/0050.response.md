According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 2`, which means `i` is currently the second last index of the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increment to `len(nums) - 1`, which is the last index of `nums`. 

Since the condition for the loop to continue is based solely on the index `i`, and `nums` is still a list with at least 3 elements, no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is equal to len(nums) - 1**
