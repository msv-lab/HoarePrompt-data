The code removes the maximum element from the list `nums`. The initial state specifies that `flag` is True and provides conditions under which `flag` can change. However, since the code does not directly affect `flag`, we focus on the state of `nums`. 

If `nums` has at least one element, after executing `nums.remove(max(nums))`, the maximum element will no longer be present in `nums`. The state of `flag` remains unchanged, but the content of `nums` changes.

Output State: **`flag` is True if all adjacent pairs of elements in `nums` have an absolute difference of less than 2, otherwise False; `nums` has the maximum element removed**.
