According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, which means `i` is currently equal to `len(nums) - 2`. Since the loop condition is `i < len(nums) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `len(nums) - 1` and `nums` must have at least 3 elements.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `nums` must have at least 3 elements, ensuring that `len(nums) - 1` is at least 2.
- `i` should be adjusted to `len(nums) - 1`.

State: **`nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, `flag` remains unchanged**
