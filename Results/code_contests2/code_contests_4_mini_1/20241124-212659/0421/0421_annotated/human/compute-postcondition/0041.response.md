Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is set to False if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, causing a break from the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains True, retaining its initial value.***
