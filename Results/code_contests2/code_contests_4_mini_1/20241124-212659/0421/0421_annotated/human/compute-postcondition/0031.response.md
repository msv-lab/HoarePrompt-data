The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and `flag` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
