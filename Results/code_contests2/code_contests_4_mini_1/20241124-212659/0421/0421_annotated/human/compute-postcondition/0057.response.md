Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` from user input, checks if any adjacent differences in the list are greater than or equal to 2, and removes the maximum value from the list in each iteration. It continues until either the list is empty or has fewer than 2 elements, or a difference of 2 or more is found. Finally, it prints 'YES' if all adjacent differences were less than 2, and 'NO' if any were greater than or equal to 2. However, the function does not actually accept a parameter `n` as stated in the annotations, nor does it explicitly require `n` to be in the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10).**
