According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 3. The other state variables `n`, `nums`, and `flag` do not need to be adjusted, as they remain the same for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `flag` is set to False, and `i` is 3**
