According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. Since `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `len(nums)` is at least 2, making `len(nums) - 1` at least 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at a value that allows the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was previously at a value less than `len(nums) - 1`, it will now be `i + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `nums` is still a list with at least 2 elements, and `flag` will depend on the comparison made during the loop body, which is not specified.

State: **`nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flag` is set to False or True depending on the comparison, `i` is incremented by 1**
