The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value of `True` to `False`. The variables `nums` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2**.
