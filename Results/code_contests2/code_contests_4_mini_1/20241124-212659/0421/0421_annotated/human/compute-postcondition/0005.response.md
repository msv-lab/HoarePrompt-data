The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value of `True`. The other variables `n`, `nums`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.
