Output State: **`flag` is True if all adjacent pairs of elements in `nums` have an absolute difference of less than 2. If at least one pair has an absolute difference of 2 or greater, `flag` is set to False and the loop exits early. If `nums` has only 1 element, the loop does not execute and `flag` remains True. If `nums` has 2 or more elements, the loop may execute up to `len(nums) - 1` times, depending on the values of the elements in `nums`.**
