Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `flag` is set to False, and `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` remains False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `flag` retains its initial value of False and continues execution without interruption.***
