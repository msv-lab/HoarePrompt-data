Output State: **`flag` is True if `nums` is empty or has fewer than 2 elements; otherwise, `flag` is False if any adjacent differences in `nums` are >= 2, and `nums` has one less element after removing the maximum value. If all adjacent differences in `nums` are < 2, `flag` remains True and `nums` has one less element. The output printed is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `flag`.**
