The value of `flag` is assigned `False`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is incremented to its next value (i + 1).

Output State: **`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is incremented to its next value (i + 1)**
