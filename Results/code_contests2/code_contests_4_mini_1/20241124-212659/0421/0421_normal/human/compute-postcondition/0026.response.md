The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `flag` was `True`, but now it changes to `False`. The other variables `nums` (which is a list) and `i` (which has a value of 1) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
