The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `flag` was `True`, so after execution, `flag` is now `False`. The values of `i` and `nums` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is False, `i` is 1, `nums` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`flag` is False, `i` is 1, `nums` remains unchanged**
