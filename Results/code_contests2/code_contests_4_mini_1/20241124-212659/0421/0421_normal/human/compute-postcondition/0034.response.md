Output State: **`flag` will be False if any consecutive pair of elements in `nums` has an absolute difference of 2 or more; otherwise, `flag` will remain True. The loop will execute `len(nums) - 1` times if `nums` has at least 2 elements. If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and `flag` remains True.**
