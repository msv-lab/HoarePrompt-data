According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop can only execute again if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, since `nums` has at least 2 elements and `max(nums)` was removed, `nums` will have at least 1 element remaining (since one element is removed from at least two). The variable `flag` remains True or False depending on the absolute differences of adjacent elements in the modified `nums`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must remain True, and `nums` must still have at least one element. Since `nums` has been modified to have at least one element, no adjustments are needed to `nums`, but `flag` must be True for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the state needs to confirm that `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty.

State: **`flag` is True and `nums` is not empty**
