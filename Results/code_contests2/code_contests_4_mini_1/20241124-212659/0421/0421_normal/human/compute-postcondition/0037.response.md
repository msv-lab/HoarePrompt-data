According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. The loop iterates from `0` to `len(nums) - 2`, which means that for the loop to execute at least once, `len(nums)` must be at least `2`. 

Given that `nums` is not empty, it must contain at least two elements for the loop to run. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be initialized to `0`.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `nums` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
