According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, and `flag` is True, indicating that the difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` was less than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next index, and `flag` should remain True since the loop continues under that condition.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now one index higher, while `flag` remains True.

State: **`flag` is True, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**
