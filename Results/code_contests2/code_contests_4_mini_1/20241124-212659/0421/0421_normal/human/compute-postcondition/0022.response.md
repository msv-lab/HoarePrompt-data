The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The values of the other variables, `nums` and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2**
