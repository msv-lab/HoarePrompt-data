According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the array `nums` and the index `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is True, indicating that the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2, allowing the loop to execute again. Since `i` was not specified, we can conclude that it must be less than `len(nums) - 1` for the loop to execute again.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new state must reflect that `i` is now one step closer to the end of the list, and `flag` remains True since the loop has not encountered a break condition.

State: **`flag` is True, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`**
