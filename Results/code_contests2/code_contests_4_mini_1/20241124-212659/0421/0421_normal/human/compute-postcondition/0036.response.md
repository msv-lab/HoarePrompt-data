According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` will be False if any consecutive pair of elements in `nums` has an absolute difference of 2 or more; otherwise, `flag` will remain True. Since the maximum element in `nums` has been removed, we need to ensure that `flag` is still True for the loop to execute one more time.

For the loop to execute again, we need `flag` to be True and `nums` to have at least one element remaining. Since we only know that `flag` is False if a certain condition is met, we can't assume its value without additional information. Therefore, to guarantee that the loop can run again, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `flag` is True.

State: **`flag` is True and `nums` is not empty**
