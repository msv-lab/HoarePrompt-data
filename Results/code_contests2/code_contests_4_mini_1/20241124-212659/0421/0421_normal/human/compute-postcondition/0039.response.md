The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The initial state indicates that `flag` was `True`, but after execution, it is now `False`. The values of `nums` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding the absolute difference between the elements in `nums` does not affect the outcome of this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
