Postcondition: ***`flag` is True initially. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains True. Additionally, since `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements and `i` is 2, we ensure that `i + 1` is a valid index within the list.***
