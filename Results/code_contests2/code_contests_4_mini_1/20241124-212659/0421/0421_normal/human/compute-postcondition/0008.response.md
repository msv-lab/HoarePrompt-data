According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, we need to determine the current value of `i`. Since the loop ends when `i` reaches `len(nums) - 1`, we can infer that `i` must currently be `len(nums) - 2` to allow the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `flag` is set to False if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, it means that if `flag` is True, the absolute difference is less than 2. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `len(nums) - 1`, which allows the loop to check the last pair of elements in `nums`. No other states need to be adjusted regarding `nums` or `flag`, as they're already set for the loop's condition.

State: **`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `flag` is True, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`**
