Postcondition: ***`flag` is True initially. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains True and `nums` remains unchanged.***
