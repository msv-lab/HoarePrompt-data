According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the `nums` list. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which must be adjusted so that it can execute one more time.

Since the loop is based on `i` and the condition is `i < len(nums) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value. Therefore, if we assume `i` was incremented at the end of the last iteration, it would now be `i + 1`.

Also, since `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, it is necessary to ensure that `len(nums)` remains at least 2 for the loop to be valid in the context of its condition.

Thus, we need to adjust `i` to ensure it will be less than `len(nums) - 1` in the next iteration. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented, and since `flag` was evaluated based on the absolute difference, we do not need to change `flag` unless otherwise specified by the loop body logic.

State: **`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `flag` remains as is, `i` is incremented to its next value (i + 1)**
