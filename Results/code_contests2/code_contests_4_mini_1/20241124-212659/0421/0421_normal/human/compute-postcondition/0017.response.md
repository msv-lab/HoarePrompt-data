Output State: **If `nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` will be set to False if any adjacent elements in `nums` have an absolute difference of 2 or more, causing the loop to break. If all adjacent elements have an absolute difference of less than 2, then `flag` remains True. If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop will not execute, and `flag` remains True.**
