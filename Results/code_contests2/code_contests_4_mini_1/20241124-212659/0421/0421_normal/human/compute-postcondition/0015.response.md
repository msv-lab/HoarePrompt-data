Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is incremented to its next value (i + 1). If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, the value of `flag` remains unchanged.***
