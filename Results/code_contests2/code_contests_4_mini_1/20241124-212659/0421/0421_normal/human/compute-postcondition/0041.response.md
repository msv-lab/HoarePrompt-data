Postcondition: ***`flag` is True initially, and if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains True. Thus, if the condition holds, `flag` is False; otherwise, `flag` remains True.***
