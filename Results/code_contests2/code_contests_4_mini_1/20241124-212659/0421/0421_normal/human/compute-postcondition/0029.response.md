According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Since `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, we know that `len(nums)` is at least 2, which means `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented to 2. 

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should now be 2. The states for `flag` and `nums` do not need to be modified as they remain valid for the next iteration.

State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
