The value of `flag` is assigned `True`, and the values of `n` and `nums` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100, and `flag` is set to True.

Output State: **`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100, and `flag` is True**
