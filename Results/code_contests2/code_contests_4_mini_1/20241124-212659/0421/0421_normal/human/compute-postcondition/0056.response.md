The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer that indicates the size of the array, constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\). The second parameter, `nums`, is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\). After executing the function body, the function performs operations based on these inputs and returns a result. However, the specific return value is not provided in the output description. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n indicating the size of the array and a list of integers nums, where each integer satisfies the specified constraints.**
