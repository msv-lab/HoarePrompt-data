The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False`. The variable `i` remains unchanged as the code only affects `flag`. Therefore, the output state is: `flag` is False, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`.

Output State: **`flag` is False, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1**
