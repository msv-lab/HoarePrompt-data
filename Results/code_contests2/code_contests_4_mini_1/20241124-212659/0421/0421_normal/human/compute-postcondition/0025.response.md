According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `nums` has at least 2 elements, which means `len(nums)` is at least 2. Therefore, `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1 in the next iteration. The state of `flag` does not need to be adjusted just yet, as it will depend on the condition evaluated in the loop body. 

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`.

State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
