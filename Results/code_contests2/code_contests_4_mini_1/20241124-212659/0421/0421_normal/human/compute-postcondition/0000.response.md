The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input as a string. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 10, it will be replaced by the input string. The other variable `nums` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input string, and `nums` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100**
