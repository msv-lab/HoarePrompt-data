Postcondition: ***`flag` is True, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the loop. If the difference is less than 2, `flag` remains True, and `i` continues to be less than `len(nums) - 1`.***
