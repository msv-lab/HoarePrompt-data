The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is incremented to its next value (i + 1), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
