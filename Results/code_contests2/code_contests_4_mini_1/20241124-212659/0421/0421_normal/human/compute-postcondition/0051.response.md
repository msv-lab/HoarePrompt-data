Output State: **If `nums` has at least 2 elements and the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` will be False and the loop will stop executing early. If all consecutive elements have an absolute difference less than 2, `flag` will remain True after checking all pairs. If `nums` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and `flag` remains True.**
