According to the code, the loop iterates from 0 to `len(nums) - 2` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `len(nums)` must be greater than 1. Given that `nums` is not empty, it implies that `len(nums)` is at least 1, but we need it to be at least 2 for the loop to run. 

Additionally, `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, the state adjustments required are as follows:

1. `nums` must contain at least 2 elements.
2. `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
