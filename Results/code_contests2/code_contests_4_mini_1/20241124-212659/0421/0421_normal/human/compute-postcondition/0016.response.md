According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the index `i` and the length of the list `nums`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented to its next value (i + 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. This means that `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `len(nums) - 1`. 

Since `i` is incremented, it indicates that the previous value of `i` was one less than its current value. Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted back to `len(nums) - 2`. 

No other states need to be adjusted as `n` and `nums` will remain the same.

State: **`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`**
