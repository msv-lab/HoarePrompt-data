The value of `flag` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous state from `True` to `False`. The other variables `n`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is `len(nums) - 1**
