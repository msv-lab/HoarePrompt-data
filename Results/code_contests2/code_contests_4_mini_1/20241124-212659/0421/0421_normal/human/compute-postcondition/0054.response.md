Output State: **`if nums is empty or has only one element, then nums remains unchanged and flag is True. If nums has at least 2 elements and any consecutive pair of elements has an absolute difference of 2 or more, flag becomes False; otherwise, flag remains True. After each iteration, the maximum element is removed from nums until nums has fewer than 2 elements or flag is False.`**
