The variable `nums` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which converts the input string (from `raw_input()`) into a list of integers. The previous values of `n` and `flag` remain unchanged; thus, the output state reflects the new assignment of `nums`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers from input, `flag` is True**
