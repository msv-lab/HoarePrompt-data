According to the code, the loop will execute again if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` had at least 2 elements and the maximum element has been removed from `nums`. This means that `nums` now has at least 1 element remaining. For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must remain True, and `nums` must still contain at least 1 element.

No adjustments are needed for `flag` as it is already stated to remain True or False based on the conditions checked. The condition for `nums` needs to be modified to indicate that it has at least 1 element.

State: **`nums` has at least 1 element; `flag` remains True or False**
