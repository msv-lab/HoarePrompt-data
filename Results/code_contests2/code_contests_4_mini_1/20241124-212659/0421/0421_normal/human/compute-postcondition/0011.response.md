Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `flag` is set to False if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, causing a break from the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains True, and no break occurs.***
