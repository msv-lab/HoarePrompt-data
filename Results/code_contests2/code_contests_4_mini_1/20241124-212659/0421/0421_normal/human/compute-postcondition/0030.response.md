The value of `flag` is assigned to `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables `nums` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
