The function accepts a series of integers input by the user and checks if the absolute difference between any consecutive integers is less than 2. If such a difference is found, the function sets a flag to False. The function continues to remove the maximum integer from the list until there are fewer than 2 integers left or the flag is False. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the flag remains True, indicating that all consecutive pairs met the condition, and 'NO' otherwise. Note that the function does not explicitly handle the case where no integers are provided, leading to potential errors if the input is not correctly formatted.
