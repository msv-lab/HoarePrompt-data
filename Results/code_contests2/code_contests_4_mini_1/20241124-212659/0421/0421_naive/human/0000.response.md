To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and identify any edge cases that may lead to incorrect results.

### Problem Description Recap:
The algorithm described involves stacking ravioli based on the values of an input array and has specific rules regarding how the stacks can interact when they are adjacent. Specifically, if two stacks differ in height by 2 or more, the top ravioli from the taller stack will slide down onto the shorter stack, which can disrupt the sorting process.

### Provided Program:
```python
n = input()
flag = True
nums = map(int, raw_input().split())
while flag and nums:
    for i in xrange(len(nums) - 1):
        if abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2:
            flag = False
            break
    nums.remove(max(nums))
print['NO', 'YES'][flag]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of integers `n` and a list of integers `nums`. However, the way `nums` is being handled with `map(int, raw_input().split())` is not compatible with Python 3; it should be `list(map(int, input().split()))`.

2. **Loop Logic**: The outer `while` loop continues as long as `flag` is `True` and `nums` is not empty. The inner `for` loop checks adjacent elements for the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2`. If this condition is satisfied for any adjacent pair, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Stack Removal**: The line `nums.remove(max(nums))` removes the tallest stack (maximum value) from the list, which is correct as per the algorithm described. However, it should be noted that this could lead to issues if the maximum value occurs multiple times, as it will only remove the first occurrence.

4. **Output Logic**: Finally, the program prints "NO" or "YES" based on the value of `flag`.

### Potential Case for Incorrectness:
Consider the input:
```
3
1 3 1
```
- Initial stacks are [1, 3, 1].
- The first check finds `abs(1 - 3) = 2`, setting `flag` to `False`, and exits the loop.
- The program then removes the maximum (3), leaving [1, 1] and prints "NO".

However, the correct output should be "YES" because it is possible to sort the array without any ravioli sliding down. After removing the 3, the next operation would not cause any conflict between the remaining stacks.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case where adjacent stacks can be removed without causing any disruptions to the sorting process because of the sliding rule. Therefore, the program fails for the input `1 3 1`.

Correctness: **False**.
