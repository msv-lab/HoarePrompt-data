Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. 

Hereâ€™s a potential case where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
4 1 3
```

Expected output:
```
NO
```

Explanation:
1. The algorithm starts with stacks of heights 4, 1, and 3.
2. When evaluating the stacks, the algorithm checks the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2`, which evaluates as `True` for the first pair (4 and 1). Therefore, it sets `flag` to `False`.
3. The algorithm then removes the maximum height, which is 4, and the remaining stacks are now 1 and 3.
4. The program would then output "YES" because `flag` remains `True` after checking the remaining stacks.

However, according to the problem description, the stacks should not be able to be sorted correctly since the ravioli from the stack of height 4 will slide down onto the stack of height 1. The algorithm fails to account for this interaction between the stacks, leading to a situation where the expected output is "NO," but the program would incorrectly output "YES."

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
