You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: HQ9+ is a joke programming language which has only four one-character instructions:

  * "H" prints "Hello, World!",
  * "Q" prints the source code of the program itself,
  * "9" prints the lyrics of "99 Bottles of Beer" song, 
  * "+" increments the value stored in the internal accumulator.



Instructions "H" and "Q" are case-sensitive and must be uppercase. The characters of the program which are not instructions are ignored.

You are given a program written in HQ9+. You have to figure out whether executing this program will produce any output.

Input

The input will consist of a single line p which will give a program in HQ9+. String p will contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. ASCII-code of each character of p will be between 33 (exclamation mark) and 126 (tilde), inclusive.

Output

Output "YES", if executing the program will produce any output, and "NO" otherwise.

Examples

Input

Hi!


Output

YES


Input

Codeforces


Output

NO

Note

In the first case the program contains only one instruction â€” "H", which prints "Hello, World!".

In the second case none of the program characters are language instructions.
Program:
```

def func():
    a = raw_input()
    for i in a:
        if i in ['H', 'Q', '9']:
            print('YES')
            a = 'tstr123'
            break
    if a != 'tstr123':
        print('NO')
```
