The value of `a` is assigned the string `'tstr123'`. This assignment changes the value of `a`, but the values of `p` and `i` remain unchanged. The second character of the string `'tstr123'`, which is `s`, does not affect the output of the code. Therefore, the output state is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is the second character of `a` which is 's', and the output is 'YES'.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's', and the output is 'YES'**
