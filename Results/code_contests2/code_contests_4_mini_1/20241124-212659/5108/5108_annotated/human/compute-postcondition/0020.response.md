The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The variables `a` and `p` are not modified by this operation, and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a` and `p`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is not equal to 'tstr123', `p` remains unchanged, and 'NO' is printed**
