Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `i` is the first character of `a`. If `i` is one of 'H', 'Q', or '9', then `a` is updated to 'tstr123' and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not one of those characters, the values of `p`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the program continues without executing the if block.***
