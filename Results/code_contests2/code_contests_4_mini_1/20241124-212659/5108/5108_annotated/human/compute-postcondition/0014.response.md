The variable `a` is assigned the value `'tstr123'`. Since `a` is being re-assigned, the previous value of `a` will be overwritten. The variable `i` is not directly affected by this assignment, and `p` remains unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `a` and retains the values of `p` and `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is the last character in the previous value of `a`, and 'YES' is printed.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is the last character in the previous value of `a`, and 'YES' is printed.**
