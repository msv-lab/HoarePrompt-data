The code prints the string 'YES', which does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables. 

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is the last character in `a`, and 'YES' is printed**.
