Postcondition: ***If `a` contains at least one character that is 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program will print 'YES', update `a` to 'tstr123', and exit the loop. If `a` does not contain any of these characters and is not an empty string, the program will print 'NO' while `p` remains unchanged, and `a` retains its original value. If `a` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and both `p` and `a` will remain unchanged.***
