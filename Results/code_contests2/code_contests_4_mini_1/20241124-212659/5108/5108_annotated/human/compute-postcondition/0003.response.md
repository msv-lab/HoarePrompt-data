The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console. The values of the variables `p`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not affect them. The output state reflects that the function executed successfully and displayed 'YES', while the values of `p`, `a`, and `i` are not altered. 

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `i` is the first character of `a`, and `i` is one of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'; the function prints 'YES'.**
