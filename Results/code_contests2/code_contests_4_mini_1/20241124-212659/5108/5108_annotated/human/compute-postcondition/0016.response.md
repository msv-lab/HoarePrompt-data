Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and if `i` is either 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program prints 'YES', sets `a` to 'tstr123', and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is any character other than 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program does not execute any statements within the if block, and the state of `a` remains unchanged as 'tstr123'.***
