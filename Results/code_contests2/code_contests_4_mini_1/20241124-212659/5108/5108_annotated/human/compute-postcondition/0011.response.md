Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters. If the second character `i` of string `a` is either 'H', 'Q', or '9', then the output is 'YES', `a` is set to 'tstr123', and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not one of these characters, then the program does not execute the print statement or modify `a`.***
