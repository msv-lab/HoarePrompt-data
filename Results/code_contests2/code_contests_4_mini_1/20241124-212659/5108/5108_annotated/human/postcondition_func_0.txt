The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input. It checks if the input contains any of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are present, it prints 'YES' and modifies the variable `a`. If none of these characters are found, it prints 'NO'. If the input is empty, it will directly print 'NO' as the loop will not execute. The function does not return any value.
