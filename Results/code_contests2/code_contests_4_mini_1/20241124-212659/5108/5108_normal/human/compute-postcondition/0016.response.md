Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and `i` is the next character in 'tstr123'. If `i` is either 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program prints 'YES', sets `a` to 'tstr123', and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not one of these characters, the program does not execute the print statement or modify `a`, but retains its previous values.***
