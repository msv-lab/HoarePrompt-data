The variable `a` is assigned the value `'tstr123'`. This assignment does not affect any other variables, so the output state will reflect the unchanged state of `p` and the new value of `a`. Therefore, the output state is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and the function prints 'YES'.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and the function prints 'YES'**
