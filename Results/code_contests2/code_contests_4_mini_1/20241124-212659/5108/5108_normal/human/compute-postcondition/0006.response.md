Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters. If the first character `i` of string `a` is one of 'H', 'Q', or '9', the string `a` is updated to 'tstr123', and 'YES' is printed. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not 'H', 'Q', or '9', no changes occur to `a`, and the program continues without printing or breaking.***
