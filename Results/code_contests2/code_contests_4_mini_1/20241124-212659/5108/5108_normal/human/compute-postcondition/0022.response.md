The function `func` accepts a parameter `p`. `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, where each character has an ASCII code between 33 (exclamation mark) and 126 (tilde), inclusive. The function does not return any value based on the provided output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string `p` that meets the specified constraints, but it does not provide any return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter p, which is a string of length between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, inclusive, and does not return any value.**
