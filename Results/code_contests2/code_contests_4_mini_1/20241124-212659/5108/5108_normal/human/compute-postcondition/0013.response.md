The code prints the string 'YES'. The variables `p`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify their values. Therefore, the output state is that `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and `i` is the next character in 'tstr123'. 

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is the next character in 'tstr123'**
