Functionality: ** The function reads a string input and checks if it contains any of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and sets the variable `a` to 'tstr123', then breaks out of the loop. If none of these characters are found after checking the entire string, it prints 'NO'. If the input string is empty, it does not print anything and the variable `a` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value. **
