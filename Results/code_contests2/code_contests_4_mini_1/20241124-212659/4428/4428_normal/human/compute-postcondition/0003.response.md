According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. Since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, this ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = N - 1`. Before the loop starts, `result` is initialized to 0, and `i` should start at 0 for the first iteration. Thus, the necessary states to ensure the loop executes correctly are that `N` is within the specified range, `result` is initialized to 0, and `i` is set to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `result` is 0, `i` is 0**
