`result` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `result` is 0, it becomes 1. The values of `N` and `i` are not affected, and the character at index `i` of `S` remains 'I'. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `result` is 1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `S` is 'I'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `result` is 1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `S` is 'I'**
