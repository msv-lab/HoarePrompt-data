Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `result` is updated based on the first character of string `S`. If the first character of `S` is 'I', then `result` is incremented by 1, resulting in `result` being 1. Otherwise, if the first character of `S` is not 'I', `result` is decremented by 1, resulting in `result` being -1.***
