The code snippet `result -= 1` decrements the value of `result` by 1. The initial state indicates that `result` is 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `result` will be -1. The variables `N`, `i`, and the first element of `S` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `result` is -1, `i` is 0, and the first element of `S` is not 'I'**
