The value of `N` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input that is a string and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `N` is defined as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `S` remains unchanged as a string of length N consisting only of characters 'I' and 'D'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of characters 'I' and 'D'**
