Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `result` is updated based on the character at index `N` of string `S`. If `S[N]` is 'I', then `result` is increased by 1; otherwise, `result` is decreased by 1. It is important to note that `S` must have a length greater than or equal to `N` to prevent index errors.***
