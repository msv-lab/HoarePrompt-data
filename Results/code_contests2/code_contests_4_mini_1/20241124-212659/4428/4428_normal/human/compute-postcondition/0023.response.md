The function `func` accepts a parameter `N`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\), and a parameter `S`, which is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. Based on these inputs, the function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to N according to the instructions given in the string `S`. Although the specific return value is not detailed in the provided output, it can be inferred that the function returns a list of integers arranged based on the 'I' (increment) and 'D' (decrement) instructions in the string `S`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string S of length N consisting only of 'I' and 'D', and returns a list of integers from 1 to N arranged according to the instructions in S.**
