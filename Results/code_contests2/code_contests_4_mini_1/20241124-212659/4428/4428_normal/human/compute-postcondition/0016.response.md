Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `result` is updated based on the character at index `i` of string `S`. If `S[i]` is 'I', then `result` is incremented by 1. If `S[i]` is not 'I', then `result` is decremented by 1. This accounts for all possible cases of the character at index `i`, including when `S[i]` may be any character other than 'I'.***
