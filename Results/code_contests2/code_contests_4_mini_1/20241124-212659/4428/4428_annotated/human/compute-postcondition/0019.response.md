Postcondition: ***`result` is an integer less than 0, which is the difference between the count of 'I' and 'D' characters in the string `S`. If `N` is greater than 0, the loop has executed `N` times; if `N` is 0 or negative, the loop has not executed and `result` was initially 0 before being calculated to be less than 0.***
