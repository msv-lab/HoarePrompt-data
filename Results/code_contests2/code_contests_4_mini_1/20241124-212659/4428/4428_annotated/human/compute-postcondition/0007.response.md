The code decrements the value of `result` by 1. The initial value of `result` is 0, so after executing the code, `result` will be -1. The other variables (`S`, `N`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string of length `N`, `N` is greater than 0, `result` is -1, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N`, `N` is greater than 0, `result` is -1, and `i` is 0**
