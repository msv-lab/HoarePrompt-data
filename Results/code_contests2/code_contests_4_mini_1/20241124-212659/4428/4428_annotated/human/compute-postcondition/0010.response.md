The value of `result` is incremented by 1. Since `result` can initially be either 1 or -1, after the operation, it will either be 2 or 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string of length `N` where `N` is greater than 1; `result` is either 2 or 0; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N` where `N` is greater than 1; `result` is either 2 or 0; `i` is 1**
