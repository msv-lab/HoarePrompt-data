`result` is incremented by 1. Since `result` can be either 0 or 2, the new value of `result` can be either 1 or 3. The values of `S` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string of length `N`, `result` is either 1 or 3, `i` is `N - 1`.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N`, `result` is either 1 or 3, `i` is `N - 1**
