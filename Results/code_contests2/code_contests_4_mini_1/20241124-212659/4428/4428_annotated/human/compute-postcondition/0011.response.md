The value of `result` is decremented by 1. Since `result` can be either 1 or -1, after the execution, `result` will be 0 or -2 respectively. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string of length `N` where `N` is greater than 1; `result` is either 0 or -2; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N` where `N` is greater than 1; `result` is either 0 or -2; `i` is 1**
