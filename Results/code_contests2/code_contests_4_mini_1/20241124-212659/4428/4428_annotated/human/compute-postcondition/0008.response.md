Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N` where `N` is greater than 0, and at index `i` (which is 0), if the character is 'I', then `result` is incremented by 1, resulting in `result = 1`. If the character at index `i` is not 'I', then `result` is decremented by 1, resulting in `result = -1`.***
