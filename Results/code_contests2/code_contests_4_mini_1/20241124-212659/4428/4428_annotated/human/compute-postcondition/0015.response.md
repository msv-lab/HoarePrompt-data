The value of `result` is decremented by 1. Since `result` can either be 0 or 2, after execution, the possible values for `result` are -1 or 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string of length `N`, `result` is either -1 or 1, `i` is `N - 1`.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N`, `result` is either -1 or 1, `i` is `N - 1**
