Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N`, and `i` is `N - 1`. If the last character of `S` is 'I', then `result` is incremented by 1, resulting in a final value of either 1 or 3. If the last character of `S` is not 'I', then `result` is decremented by 1, resulting in a final value of either -1 or 1.***
