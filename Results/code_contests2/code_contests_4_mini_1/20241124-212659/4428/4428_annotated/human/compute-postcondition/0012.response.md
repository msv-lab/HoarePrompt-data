Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N` where `N` is greater than 1. If `S[1]` is 'I', then `result` is incremented by 1, resulting in either 2 or 0 depending on the initial value. If `S[1]` is not 'I', then `result` is decremented by 1, resulting in either 0 or -2 depending on the initial value.***
