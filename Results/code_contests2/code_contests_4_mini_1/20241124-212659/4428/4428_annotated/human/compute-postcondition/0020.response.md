The variable `result` is assigned the value `0`. Since the initial state specifies that `result` is an integer less than `0`, this assignment changes `result` from its negative value to `0`. The state of other variables is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `result` is now 0.

Output State: **`result` is now 0**
