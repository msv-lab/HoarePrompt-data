Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the input reading. Specifically, it uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3; it should use `input()` instead. This would lead to a `NameError` when trying to run the program in a Python 3 environment, as `raw_input()` does not exist. 

Additionally, the program assumes that the input will be read without any issues, but if the input includes invalid values or incorrect formatting, it would not handle those cases, leading to potential runtime errors. 

For example, if the input were:
```
3
1 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 1
```
The script would fail on the `raw_input()` line, which should be `input()` in Python 3, thus causing the program to not function correctly.

Therefore, the program is not correct as it does not handle different scenarios properly, particularly regarding input methods, making it fail in practical use cases.
