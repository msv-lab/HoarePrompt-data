According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to 1, `mask` is equal to 2, and `j` is equal to 0. This means the loop has executed for `j = 0` and is ready to execute for the next value of `j`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1, and it must still be less than `n`. Since `n` is at least 1, `j` can move to 1 without any issues.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 1, `mask` is equal to 2, `j` is equal to 1**
