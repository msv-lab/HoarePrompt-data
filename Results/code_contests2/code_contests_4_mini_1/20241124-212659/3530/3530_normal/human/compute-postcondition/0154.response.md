Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the cumulative updates from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for each `j` in the range of `n` where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set. If none of the conditions are met for any `j`, `dp[i][mask]` retains its original value. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `i`, and `mask` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution, with `n` being at least 1, `i` equal to 1, and `mask` equal to 2.**
