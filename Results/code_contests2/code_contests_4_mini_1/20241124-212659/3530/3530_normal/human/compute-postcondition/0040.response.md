The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. The initial value of `mask` is 2, and the bitwise AND operation confirms that the j-th bit is set in `mask`. The values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` are affected, but the specific values of these variables are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the operation being performed based on the current values.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, where `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND operation confirms a non-zero result.**
