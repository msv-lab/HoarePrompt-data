The operation modifies `dp[i][mask]` by applying a modulo operation with `MOD`. It takes the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and reduces it modulo `MOD`, ensuring that the value stays within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are not affected by this statement, but it ensures any calculations or updates to `dp[i][mask]` remain valid under the modulo constraint.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated as `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`**
