According to the code, the loop will execute for `mask` values ranging from 1 to `2^n - 1`. Since the loop starts at 1, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `mask` must be adjusted to the next value in the range. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is currently at a value that is less than `2^n`, which means it is likely 1 less than the next power of two minus one. Therefore, we need to increment `mask` by 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated as per the loop conditions, mask is set to the next value in the range (which is 2 in this case if it was 1).**
