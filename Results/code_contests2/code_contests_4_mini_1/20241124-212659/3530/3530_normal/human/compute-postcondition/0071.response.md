To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given information.

1. The variable `i` is currently less than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is at least 1 and can go up to `n`.
3. The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`, which implies that `i` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute.
4. If `i` is currently at `n`, the loop will not execute again since the next value of `i` would be `n + 1`, which is outside the range.

Given that `dp[i][mask]` contains cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, we need to consider that for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, we can conclude that we need to adjust the state of `i`:

- If `n` is at least 1, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is `n + 1`.

In summary, the only change needed in the state is to increment `i` to `n + 1`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1**
