According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to 2, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 3. Since `n` is at least 3, it can accommodate `j` being equal to 3.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `j` becomes 3.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is equal to 1, `mask` is equal to 2, `j` is equal to 3**
