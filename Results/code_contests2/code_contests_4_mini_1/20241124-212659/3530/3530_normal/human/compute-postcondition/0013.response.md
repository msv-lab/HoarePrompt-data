The code assigns the value `1` to the element `dp[0][i]`. The variable `dp` is a list of lists initialized to `0`, and `i` is `0`. This means that the specific element at row `0` and column `i` of the `dp` list will now hold the value `1`. The other elements of `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a list of lists initialized to 0 with appropriate dimensions based on `n`, `i` is 0, and `dp[0][i]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists initialized to 0 with appropriate dimensions based on `n`, `i` is 0, and `dp[0][i]` is set to 1**
