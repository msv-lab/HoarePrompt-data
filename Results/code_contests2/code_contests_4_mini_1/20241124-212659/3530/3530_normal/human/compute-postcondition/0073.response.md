According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, which is already satisfied in the given state. Before the loop starts, `j` is expected to be initialized to 0 since it is the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0**
