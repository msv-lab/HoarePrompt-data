Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]` where the corresponding bits in `mask` are set. If `mask` does not correspond to any `j` with `a[i - 1][j]` equal to 1, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes for all masks from 1 to `2^n - 1`. If `n` is 0 or if `a[i - 1]` contains all zeros, the loop does not execute at all, leaving `dp[i][mask]` in its initial state (0 for all cases except `dp[0]`, which is a list of `2^n` ones).**
