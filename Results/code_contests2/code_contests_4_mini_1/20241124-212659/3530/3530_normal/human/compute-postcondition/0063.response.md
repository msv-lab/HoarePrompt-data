According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`, which is the loop index iterating over the range `n`. In the previous iteration, `j` has not been specified, but we know that it iterates through values starting from 0 up to `n-1`. 

If the loop has completed its current iteration with `j` being `n-1`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be reset to 0 for the next iteration, and the loop will not execute again unless the loop condition allows for another iteration. 

However, if `j` is currently less than `n-1`, it will simply increment in the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate the next index for `j`.

Assuming the last value of `j` was `n - 1`, we need to ensure that `j` is reset to 0 for the loop to execute again, and if `j` was less than `n - 1`, it would just increment by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` reflects the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1][j]` and if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `mask` has the `j`th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and this result is taken modulo `MOD`, j is 0** (if `j` was `n-1` in the last iteration) or **`j is n`** (if `j` was less than `n-1` in the last iteration).
