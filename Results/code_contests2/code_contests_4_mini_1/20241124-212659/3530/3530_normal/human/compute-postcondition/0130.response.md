The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Given that `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1, we need to evaluate `mask ^ 1 << j`. 

First, we calculate `1 << j`, which is `1 << 1` resulting in `2`. Then, we calculate `mask ^ 2`, where `mask` is `1`. Thus, `1 ^ 2` results in `3`. 

This means the statement modifies `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[0][3]` to it. The state of `dp[i][mask]` will be affected, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[0][3]`; `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1.**
