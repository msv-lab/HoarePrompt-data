According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to iterate over `mask` from 1 to `1 << n` (which is 2 raised to the power of `n`). In order for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1, which is already given in the state. 

At the start of the first iteration of the loop, `mask` should be initialized to 1, as the loop begins at 1. Thus, the relevant states to ensure the loop can execute are that `n` is at least 1 (which is confirmed) and `mask` is initialized to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 1**
