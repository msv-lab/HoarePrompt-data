The code appends the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to the list `a`. The `raw_input().split()` function takes user input and splits it into components, while `map(int, ...)` converts each of those components into integers. The exact values of the integers to be appended depend on user input, but `a` is modified by adding these integer values. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing the integers from user input after appending new integers, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
