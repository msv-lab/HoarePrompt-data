Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated such that if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` (which is 2) has a bit corresponding to `j` set (which is 0), then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` and taken modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the bitwise AND check fails (indicating mask does not contain the bit for `j`), `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. Since `mask` is 2 (binary `10`), this specifically checks the second least significant bit. Therefore, the operation only updates `dp[i][mask]` if both conditions are satisfied, meaning the function effectively handles the cases for `mask`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and the bitwise operations accurately.***
