The code updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Given the initial conditions, `mask` is 1 and `j` is 0, so the operation inside the brackets calculates `mask ^ 1 << j`, which is `1 ^ 1`, resulting in `0`. Therefore, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][0]`.

The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is cumulative based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, and since `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, this indicates that the cumulative updates are being considered for the first element of `a`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `mask` are not affected.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0.**
