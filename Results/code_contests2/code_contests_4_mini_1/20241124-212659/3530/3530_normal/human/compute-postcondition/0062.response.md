Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` reflects the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1][j]` and if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `mask` has the `j`th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and this result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
