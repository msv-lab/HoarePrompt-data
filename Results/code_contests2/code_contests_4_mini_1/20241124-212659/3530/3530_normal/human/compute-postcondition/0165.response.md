According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. However, since `n` is at least 1, we cannot determine its exact value, but we need to ensure that it is at least 3 for the loop to execute again when `j` is 2.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the state of `j` should be updated to 2, and for this to be valid, `n` should be at least 3.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 2**
