Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask` for each `j` in the range of `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` will accumulate values from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` modulo `MOD`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 0 or `mask & (1 << j)` is zero, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged for that iteration.**
