The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Here, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 1, and `j` is `n`. This means that the cumulative updates in `dp[i][mask]` will include contributions from the previous row of the dynamic programming table, specifically from the state where the `mask` is altered by the bitwise XOR operation with `1 << j`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not explicitly given, but it will be updated based on the current computation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the update to `dp[i][mask]` without altering any other variables or states.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
