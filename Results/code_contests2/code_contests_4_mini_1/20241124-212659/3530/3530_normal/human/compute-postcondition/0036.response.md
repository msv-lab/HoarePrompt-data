Output State: **After executing the loop, `dp[i][mask]` is updated only if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set. If both conditions are satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo `MOD`. If either condition fails for all iterations of j (0 to n-1), then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged from its previous value, which is 0 for all cases except the base case where `dp[0]` is initialized to a list of `2^n` ones. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute at all, leaving `dp[i][mask]` at its initial state (0 for all cases except the base case with `dp[0]`).**
