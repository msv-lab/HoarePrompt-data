Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise operation `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the condition fails, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
