The operation `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Given that `mask` is 2 (which is `10` in binary), and `j` is 0, the expression `1 << j` evaluates to `1`, so `mask ^ 1 << j` computes as `2 ^ 1`, resulting in `1` (which is `01` in binary).

Thus, the code updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][1]` to it, where `dp[i - 1][1]` contains the cumulative updates based on the previous state.

The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not explicitly given, but it is updated based on the previous state `dp[i - 1][1]`. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the update of `dp[i][mask]`:

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][1]`**
