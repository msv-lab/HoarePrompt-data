The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This operation does not affect the value of other variables but ensures that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of other variables and the updated state of `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
