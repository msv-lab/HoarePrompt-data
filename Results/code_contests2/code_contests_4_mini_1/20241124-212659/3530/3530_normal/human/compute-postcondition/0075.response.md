The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. Given that `mask` is 1 and `j` is 0, the computation of `mask ^ 1 << j` results in `1 ^ 1`, which equals `0`. Therefore, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][0]`. The previous state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` to it; the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, `mask` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, and `j` is 0.**
