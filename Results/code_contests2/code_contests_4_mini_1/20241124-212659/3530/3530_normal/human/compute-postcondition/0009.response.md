According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop executes one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing the previous integers and new integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
