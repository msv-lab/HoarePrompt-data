According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `mask` from 1 to `1 << n`, which means it can execute for each possible value of `mask` that is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be incremented to the next value, which would be `mask` equal to 3. Additionally, since `n` is at least 1, this condition is satisfied for the loop to continue.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 3**
