According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is at least 1, meaning the loop can execute again as long as `n` is at least 1 and `j` gets incremented.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1 (the next value in the range). Since `n` is at least 1, it allows for `j` to take the value of 1 in the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `j` needs to be updated to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted since `n` is still valid for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 1**
