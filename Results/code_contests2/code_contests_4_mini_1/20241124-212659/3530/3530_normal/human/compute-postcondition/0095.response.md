The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `mask` is 2 and `j` is 1, so we calculate `mask ^ 1 << j`. The operation `1 << j` results in `2`, and `mask ^ 2` gives us `0`. Therefore, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` to its current value. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` to its current value; `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 1**
