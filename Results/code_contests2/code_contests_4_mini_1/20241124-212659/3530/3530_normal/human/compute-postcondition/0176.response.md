The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\), and `a`, which is a 2D list of integers where each element `a[i][j]` is either 0 or 1, representing the compatibility between Man \(i\) and Woman \(j\). The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the compatibility data represented in the 2D list.

However, the output details are not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot accurately describe the return value without further details.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N and a 2D list a of integers representing compatibility between men and women. It processes these inputs but the specific return value is not defined in the given information.**
