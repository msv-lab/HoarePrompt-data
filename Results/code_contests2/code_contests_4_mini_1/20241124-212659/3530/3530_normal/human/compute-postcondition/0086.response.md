According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. Given that `j` is currently pointing to the last iteration of the loop (i.e., the value of `j` at the end of the last iteration is `n - 1`), for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be adjusted to `n`, and since the loop is structured to iterate over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`, this indicates that the loop cannot execute anymore after `j` reaches `n`.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop does not depend on any other conditions apart from the value of `j` in relation to `n`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value of `a[i - 1][j]`, `j` is n**
