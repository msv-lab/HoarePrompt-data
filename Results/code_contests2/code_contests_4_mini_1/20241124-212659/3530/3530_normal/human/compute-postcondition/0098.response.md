According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, and we need to ensure `n` is at least 3 to allow for further iterations. 

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `j` is now 2.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 3, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 2.**
