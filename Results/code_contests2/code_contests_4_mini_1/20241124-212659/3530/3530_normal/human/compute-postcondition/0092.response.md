The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and then performing the operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`. This means that `dp[i][mask]` is assigned the remainder of its current value when divided by `MOD`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
