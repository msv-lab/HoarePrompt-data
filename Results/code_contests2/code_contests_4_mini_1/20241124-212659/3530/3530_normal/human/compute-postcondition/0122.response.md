According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop is designed to iterate from `1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which means the loop has completed its last iteration and will not execute again since the next value of `i` would be `n + 2`, which is outside the range of the loop.

Since the loop is already at its terminating condition, to allow for the loop to execute one more time, `n` would need to be adjusted to at least `1`, which would allow the loop to iterate with `i` set to `1`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` should be greater than or equal to `1` (to ensure the loop can execute).
- `i` should be reset to `1`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `dp[i][mask]` is already defined and contains the cumulative updates based on previous values.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1**
