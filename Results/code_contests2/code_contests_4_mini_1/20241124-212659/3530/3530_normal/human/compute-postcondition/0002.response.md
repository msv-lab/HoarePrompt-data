The code initializes `a` as an empty list. This does not change the previous values of `N`, `MOD`, or `n`. The variable `a` is now ready to hold values but currently contains no elements. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is an empty list; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is an input value.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is an empty list; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is an input value**
