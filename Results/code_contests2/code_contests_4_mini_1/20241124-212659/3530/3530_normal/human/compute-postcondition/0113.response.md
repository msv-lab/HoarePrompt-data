Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to its previous value if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bit corresponding to `j` is set in `mask`. After this operation, `dp[i][mask]` is then taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
