The line of code updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. Given the initial state, we know that `mask` is 3 and `j` is 0. 

1. Calculating `1 << j` gives us `1 << 0`, which is `1`.
2. The value of `mask ^ 1 << j` is `3 ^ 1`, which results in `2`.
3. Therefore, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by adding `dp[i - 1][2]` to its current value.

Other variables remain unchanged, thus the output state reflects the update made to `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][2]` to its current value, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, and `a[i - 1][j]` is 1**.
