The value at `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value `1`. The variable `i` is `2`, so this means that `dp[0][2]` is set to `1`. The previous state of `dp` is not specified, but its structure indicates that it is a list of lists initialized to `0` with appropriate dimensions based on `n`. The state of other elements in `dp` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change at the specific index.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists initialized to 0 with appropriate dimensions based on `n`, and `dp[0][2]` is set to 1**
