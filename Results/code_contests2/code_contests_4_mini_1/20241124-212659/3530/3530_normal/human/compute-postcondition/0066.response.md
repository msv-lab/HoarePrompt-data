Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values in `a[i - 1][j]` and the state of `mask`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met (i.e., either `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or the `j`th bit of `mask` is not set), `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
