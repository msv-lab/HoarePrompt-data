According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The range for `i` is determined by `1 << n`, which is equivalent to \(2^n\). For the loop to execute, \(n\) must be at least 0, since \(1 << n\) will yield at least 1 when \(n = 0\). 

Given the states provided:
- If \(n = 0\), the loop will execute once (for \(i = 0\)).
- If \(1 \leq n \leq 21\), the loop will execute \(2^n\) times.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will reflect the last value it took, which is \(2^n - 1\) for values of \(n\) greater than 0.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that \(n\) is defined (i.e., \(n \geq 0\)), and set `i` to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists initialized to 0 with appropriate dimensions based on `n`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
