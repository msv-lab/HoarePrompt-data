According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Since `mask` is given as 1, it indicates that we are considering a specific bitmask. The variable `j` will start at 0 and increment with each iteration of the loop.

At the start of the loop, for `j` to begin from its initial value, it should be set to 0. The conditions for the loop to execute are satisfied since `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` reflects the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0**
