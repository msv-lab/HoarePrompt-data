Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the cumulative updates from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, ensuring that `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `mask` remain unchanged, with `n` being at least 1, `i` equal to 1, `mask` equal to 2, and `j` equal to 0. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` retains its original value.***
