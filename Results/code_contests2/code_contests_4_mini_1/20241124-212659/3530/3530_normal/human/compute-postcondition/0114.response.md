According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j`. The loop iterates through `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop would have executed for `j` values from 0 to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`. 

Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, and assuming `j` was at `n - 1` at the end of the last iteration, it must be adjusted to `n`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated as described, j is n**
