Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is equal to 1, `mask` is equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
