The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when it is divided by `MOD`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` was previously updated by adding `dp[0][3]`. The specific values of `dp[0][3]`, `MOD`, and the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` are unknown, but the operation ensures that the resultant value of `dp[i][mask]` is within the range of 0 to `MOD-1`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` remain unaffected except for `i`, which is noted as 1, and `mask`, which is noted as 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value modulo `MOD`.**
