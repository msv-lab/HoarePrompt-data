Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `dp[0]` is a list of `2^n` ones, the rest of `dp` contains lists initialized to 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and this value is taken modulo `MOD`. If either condition fails, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
