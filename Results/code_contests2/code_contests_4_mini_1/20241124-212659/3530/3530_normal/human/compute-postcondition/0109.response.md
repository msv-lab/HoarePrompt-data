Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j` (i.e., the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
