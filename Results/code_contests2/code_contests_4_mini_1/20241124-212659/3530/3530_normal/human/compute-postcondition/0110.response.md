To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Current State**: At the end of the last iteration, we have:
   - `dp[i][mask]` contains cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`
   - `n` is at least 1 (indicating that there is at least one iteration available in the for loop)
   - `mask` is 3
   - `j` is 0

2. **For Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over `j` in the range of `n`, which means it will run as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Current Value of `j`**: Since `j` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution**: We need to ensure that the loop can run again:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Since `n` is at least 1 and `j` is 0, it can indeed execute one more time when `j` is incremented.

5. **New State Requirements**:
   - The new value of `j` will be 1 for the next iteration of the loop.
   - The value of `mask` and the value in `dp[i][mask]` do not need to be changed for the next iteration since they are not dependent on `j`.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to increment `j`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 1.**
