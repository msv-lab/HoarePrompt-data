According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times, starting with `j` as 0 in the first iteration. The provided state indicates that `n` is at least 1 and `i` is already set to 1, which is not relevant for the execution of the loop. The `mask` variable does not affect the loop execution either.

For the loop to execute correctly, we need to consider the initial value of `j`, which is implicitly initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. Therefore, we can summarize the necessary adjustments to the states.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0**
