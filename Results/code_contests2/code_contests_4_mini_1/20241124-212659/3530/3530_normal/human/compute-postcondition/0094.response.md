According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `dp[i][mask]`, `mask`, and `a[i - 1][j]` do not change in this context. 

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 1**
