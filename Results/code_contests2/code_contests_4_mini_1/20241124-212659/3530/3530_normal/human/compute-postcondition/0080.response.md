The line of code updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking the value of `dp[i][mask]` and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The specific value of `dp[i][mask]` is not provided in the initial state, but it is being modified. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state indicates that `dp[i][mask]` is now the result of `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
