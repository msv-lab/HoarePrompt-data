According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was at its current value (let's denote it as `j`), which means for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Thus, the updated state for the next iteration requires adjusting `j` to `j + 1`. The other states mentioned (like `dp[i][mask]`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `mask`) remain unchanged since they are not affected by the increment of `j`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values in `a[i - 1][j]` and the state of `mask`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` remains unchanged**
