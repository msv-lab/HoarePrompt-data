The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. 

In this case, we know that:
- `dp[i][mask]` reflects the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `mask` is 1, which means the binary representation of `mask` is `01`.
- `j` is 0, indicating we are checking the least significant bit.
- The element at `a[i - 1][0]` is equal to 1.
- The bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` being true indicates that the 0-th bit of `mask` is set.

The computation involves:
- `mask ^ 1 << j` will result in `1 ^ 1`, which equals `0`. 
- Therefore, `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` translates to `dp[i - 1][0]`.

This means the value from `dp[i - 1][0]` will be added to `dp[i][1]`. 

Since there is no specific value given for `dp[i - 1][0]` or `dp[i][1]` in the initial state, we cannot determine exact numerical values; we can only infer that `dp[i][1]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][0]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` to it, reflecting the cumulative updates based on `a[i - 1]`.**
