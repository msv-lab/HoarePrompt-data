Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` reflects the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or `mask` does not have the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. Additionally, edge cases are considered where the values in `a[i - 1]` could vary, affecting the conditional check and the potential update to `dp[i][mask]`.***
