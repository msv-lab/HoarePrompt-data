Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
