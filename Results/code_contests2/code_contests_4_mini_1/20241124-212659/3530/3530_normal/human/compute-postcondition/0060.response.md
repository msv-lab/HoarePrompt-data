The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The calculation involves the bitwise XOR operation on `mask` with `1 << j`, which means that a specific bit related to `j` in `mask` is toggled. 

The cumulative updates in `dp[i][mask]` reflect the previous values from `dp[i - 1][...]`, indicating that the current state depends on the previous state with some modifications based on `mask` and `j`. 

Since the exact values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are not provided, we acknowledge that the state of `dp[i][mask]` will now contain an updated cumulative value based on the previous state.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` reflects the updated cumulative value based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
