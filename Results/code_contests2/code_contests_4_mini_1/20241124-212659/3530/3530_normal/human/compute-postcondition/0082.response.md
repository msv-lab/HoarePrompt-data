According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Since `j` will start from 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to `n`, which is outside the current range.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need to set `j` to `n`, and `n` remains unchanged since it is at least 1.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1][j]`, where `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is n**
