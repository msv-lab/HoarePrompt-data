Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `mask` is 1. The loop executes `n` times, iterating over `j` from 0 to n-1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. If either condition fails for all iterations, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains as initially set.**
