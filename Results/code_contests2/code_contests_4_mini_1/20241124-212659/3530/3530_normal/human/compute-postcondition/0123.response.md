According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over `mask` from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), which means that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to have any iterations. Given that `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once with `mask` starting at 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state of `mask` would be the last value it can take, which is \(2^n - 1\). Since `i` is already set to 1, we do not need to adjust it.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1**
