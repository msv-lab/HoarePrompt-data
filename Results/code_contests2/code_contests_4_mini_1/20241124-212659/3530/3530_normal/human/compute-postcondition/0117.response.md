Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition that `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero. If this condition is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
