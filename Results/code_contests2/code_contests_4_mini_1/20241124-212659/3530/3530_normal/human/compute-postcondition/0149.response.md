According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to 1, and `n` is at least 1. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2. However, to ensure that the loop can execute again, `n` must also be at least 3 (since `j` will take the values 0, 1, and 2). 

Thus, the state must reflect that `j` is now 2, and the condition for `n` should be updated to ensure it can accommodate this value.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is equal to 1, `mask` is equal to 2, `j` is equal to 2**
