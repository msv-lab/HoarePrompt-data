The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulus of the current value of `dp[i][mask]` with respect to `MOD`. Since the initial state does not provide the specific value of `dp[i][mask]`, we can only indicate that it has been updated according to the modulus operation.

Other variables (`n`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, and the previous value of `dp[i][mask]`) remain unaffected by this operation itself.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`**
