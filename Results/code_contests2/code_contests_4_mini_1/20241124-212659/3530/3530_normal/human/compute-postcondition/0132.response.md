Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. This ensures that the function properly handles the case where `a[i - 1][j]` is either 0 or if the j-th bit in `mask` is not set.***
