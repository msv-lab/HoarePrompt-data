Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 2. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise operation `mask & 1 << j` is true for any `j` in the range, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the condition fails for all `j`, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is at least 1 and there are no valid `j` indices (where `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` is true), `dp[i][mask]` remains as it was before the loop executed.**
