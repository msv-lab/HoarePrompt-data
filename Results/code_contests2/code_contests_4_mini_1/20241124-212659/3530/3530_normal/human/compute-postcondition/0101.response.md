Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 3, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bit represented by `j` is set in `mask`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and applying modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or the bit is not set in `mask`, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
