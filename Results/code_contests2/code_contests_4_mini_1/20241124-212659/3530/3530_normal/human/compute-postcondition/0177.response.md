Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` followed by `n` lines of space-separated integers representing compatibility between individuals. It constructs a 2D list `a` from this input. The function utilizes dynamic programming to calculate a value based on the compatibility matrix `a`, specifically it computes the number of valid selections of compatible pairs of individuals and prints the result modulo `1000000007`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a valid integer or where the input format is incorrect, and it does not explicitly return any value; it only prints the computed result. **
