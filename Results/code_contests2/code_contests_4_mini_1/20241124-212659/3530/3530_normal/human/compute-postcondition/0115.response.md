The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variable `j` is equal to `n`, so the expression `mask ^ 1 << j` computes a new mask based on the original mask. This operation modifies the specific bit of the mask corresponding to `j` and retrieves the value from the previous state of `dp`. The previous values of the affected variables are not directly specified, but the operation indicates that `dp[i][mask]` is being incremented by a value from a different index of the `dp` array.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` is updated with an addition from a previous state.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated as `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `j` is `n`**
