To determine the necessary state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop structure and the provided state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop structure is:
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the provided state information, we know that:
1. The loop variable `j` is used as an index.
2. The loop will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = n - 1`.
3. At the end of the previous iteration, we need to infer the value of `j`.

Since we need to prepare for the next iteration of the loop, we need to determine what the current value of `j` was at the end of the last iteration and what it should be at the start of the next iteration.

If the loop has just completed the last iteration for `j = n - 1`, then to execute again, `j` should be incremented to `n`, which is out of the loop's range and means the loop cannot execute again.

If the loop was in its previous iteration with `j` equal to `n - 1` or lower, we must increment `j` to reflect its next value. 

Thus, if `j` was `n - 1` previously, it should now be `n`. If `j` was less than `n - 1`, we need to increase it by 1.

The conditions are:
- If `j` was `n - 1`, `j` should now be `n`.
- If `j` was less than `n - 1`, we need to update `j` to `j + 1`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `j`, we can only make a general statement based on the provided conditions.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we can state that `j` must be adjusted based on its previous value.

State: **`j` is less than n - 1, hence it is now incremented to its next value, while other states remain unchanged**
