Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 1. If the value at `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
