The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The initial state indicates that `dp[i][mask]` already contains cumulative updates based on values in `a[i - 1][j]`, meaning it has some value before this operation. The variable `mask` has a value of 1, and `j` has a value of `n`, which indicates that the operation will affect the specific entry in the `dp` array.

After the operation, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` plus the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is unknown, but the operation still takes place.

Thus, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
