Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `mask` has the bit corresponding to `j` set. In this case, `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` and taken modulo `MOD`. If either condition is not satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. Thus, `dp[i][mask]` effectively reflects the cumulative value based on the specified conditions, ensuring proper handling for the cases where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise operations regarding `mask` are applicable.***
