According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to the range defined by `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `1 << n`, which is equivalent to \(2^n\).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition `i < (1 << n)` must still hold true.

Since `n` is not provided a specific value, we can say that `i` should be less than \(2^n\) for the loop to continue. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is set in such a way that \(2 > 1 << n\) does not hold, meaning we need `n` to be equal to or greater than 1.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- Update `i` to 2.
- Ensure that `n` is at least 1, so that \(1 << n\) is greater than 2.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists initialized to 0 with appropriate dimensions based on `n`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1**
