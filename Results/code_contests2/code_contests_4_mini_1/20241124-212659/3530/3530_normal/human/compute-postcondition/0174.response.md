Output State: **If n is 0, dp remains [[0]] and does not change. If 1 <= n <= 21, after the loop executes `2^n` times, `dp[i][mask]` contains cumulative updates based on `a[i - 1][j]` where the corresponding bits in `mask` are set, modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1]` contains all zeros, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged for that iteration. If `mask` is not in the valid range (1 to `2^n - 1`), or if no valid `j` indices exist where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged for that iteration. Thus, `dp` will reflect the computed values based on the input matrix `a` and the number of valid masks processed.**
