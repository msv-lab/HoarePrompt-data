According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the limit `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would be equal to `n - 1` if it has executed every time from 0 to `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to `n`, which is the next valid index beyond `n - 1`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `mask` has the bit corresponding to `j` set; `j` is equal to n**
