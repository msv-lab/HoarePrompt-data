According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, which is already given. At the start of the loop, `j` will initialize at 0 (the starting point of the range). 

So, the necessary states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` is at least 1 (which is already satisfied),
- `i` is 1 (already provided),
- `mask` is 1 (already provided),
- `j` needs to be initialized to 0 (the starting value for the loop).

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0**
