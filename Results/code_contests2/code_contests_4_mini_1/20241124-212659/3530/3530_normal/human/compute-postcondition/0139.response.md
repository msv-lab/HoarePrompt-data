According to the code, the loop iterates over `mask` from 1 to `1 << n` (exclusive). The condition for the loop to execute is that `n` must be at least 1, which it is. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be incremented. Since `mask` iterates from 1 to `1 << n`, which is `2^n`, the next value for `mask` will be 2. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `n` is already at least 1. 

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `mask` is 2.**
