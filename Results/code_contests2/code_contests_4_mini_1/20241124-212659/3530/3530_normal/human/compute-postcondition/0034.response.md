Postcondition: ***If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` taken modulo `MOD`. If either condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged from its previous state, which is 0 for all cases except the base case where `dp[0]` is initialized to a list of `2^n` ones.***
