Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value of `a[i - 1][j]`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taken modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or `mask` does not include the bit corresponding to `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
