The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. Here, `mask` is currently 3 and `j` is 1. The operation `1 << j` results in `2`, so we calculate `mask ^ 2`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]` are unknown, but we know that `dp[i][mask]` will be increased by the value from the previous row with the updated mask.

Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]`, where `mask` is 3, `j` is 1, and `mask ^ 2` evaluates to 1.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]`, where `mask` is 3, `j` is 1, and `mask ^ 2` evaluates to 1**
