Output State: **`a` is a list containing the integers from user input, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `MOD` is 1000000007, and `n` is the number of times the loop has executed. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `a` remains an empty list. If `n` is greater than 21, it should be noted that this would violate the initial constraints of `N`.**
