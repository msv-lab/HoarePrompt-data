Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` reflects the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0. The element at `a[i - 1][0]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true (indicating that the j-th bit of mask is set).***
