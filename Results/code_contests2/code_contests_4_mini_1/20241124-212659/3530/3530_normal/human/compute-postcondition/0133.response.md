To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop's control variable `j` and the condition under which the loop will run.

1. The loop iterates over `j` in the range of `n`. 
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.

Given that `n` is at least 1, if `j` is currently 1, we need to check whether it can be incremented for the next iteration. 

- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < n`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2 (the next integer).

No other states need to be adjusted since `mask` remains the same and the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask` are not directly affected by the loop control variable `j`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 2.**
