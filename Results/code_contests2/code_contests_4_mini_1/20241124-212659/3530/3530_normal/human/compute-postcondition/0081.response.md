Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1][j]`, where `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is n. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bit corresponding to `j` is set in `mask`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
