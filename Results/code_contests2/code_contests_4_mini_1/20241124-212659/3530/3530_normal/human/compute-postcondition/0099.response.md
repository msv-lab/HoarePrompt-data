The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. Here, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 2, which means we perform a bitwise XOR operation: `mask ^ (1 << j)` results in `2 ^ 4`, which equals `6`. 

As a result, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][6]`. The exact values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][6]` are not specified, but the operation affects only `dp[i][mask]`.

Since the other variables (`n`, `mask`, and `j`) remain unchanged, the output state reflects the cumulative nature of the updates.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][6]`, `n` is at least 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2**
