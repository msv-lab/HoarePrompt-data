Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
