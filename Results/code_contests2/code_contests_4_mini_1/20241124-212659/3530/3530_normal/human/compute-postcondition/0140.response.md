According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1, which is already stated in the pre-loop state. Additionally, the variable `j` will start at 0 before the first execution of the loop.

For the loop to execute, the initial values of `j` and `n` are sufficient as `j` will start from 0 and iterate up to `n - 1`. Since `n` is at least 1, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

Thus, the adjusted states before the loop starts are: `dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0**
