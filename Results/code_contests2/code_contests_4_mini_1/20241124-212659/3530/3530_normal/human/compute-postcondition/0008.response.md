The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into separate values, converts those values into integers using `map(int, ...)`, and appends the resulting map object to the list `a`. The list `a` will now contain the original values along with the new integers provided by the user input. 

Since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `a` is a list containing integers, `MOD` is 1000000007, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the output state reflects that `a` has been updated with new integers from user input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing the previous integers and new integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
