According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which dictates how many iterations the loop will perform. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 1. The loop uses `j` as an index that ranges from 0 to `n - 1`. 

Since `j` starts at 0 and will increment by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to 2 in the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to 2. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted, as it is already at least 1, allowing for the loop to execute.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2**
