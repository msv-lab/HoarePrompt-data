Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, and if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` includes the bit at position `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or `mask` does not include the bit at position `j`, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
