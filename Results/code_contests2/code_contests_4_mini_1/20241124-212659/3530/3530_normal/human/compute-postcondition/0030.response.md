Postcondition: ***If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged, retaining its initial value from the previous state, which is 0 for all other cases except for the base case where `dp[0]` is initialized to a list of `2^n` ones.***
