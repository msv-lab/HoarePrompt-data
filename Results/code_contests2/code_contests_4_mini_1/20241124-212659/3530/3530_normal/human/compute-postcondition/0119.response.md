Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bit corresponding to `j` is set in `mask` (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is non-zero), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 0 for all `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` also remains unchanged.**
