Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]` where `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is at least 1. The loop executes for each `mask` from 1 to `(1 << n) - 1` and for each valid `j` in the range of `0` to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. If there are no valid `j` indices (where `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` is true), or if `mask` is not in the valid range, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
