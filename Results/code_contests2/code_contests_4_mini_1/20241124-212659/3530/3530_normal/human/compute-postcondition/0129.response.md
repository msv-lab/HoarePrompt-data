According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `mask` is 1, with `j` currently being 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment to the next integer. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to 1. Since `n` is at least 1, it allows for `j` to take the value of 1. There are no other states that need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the values in `a[i - 1]`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1.**
