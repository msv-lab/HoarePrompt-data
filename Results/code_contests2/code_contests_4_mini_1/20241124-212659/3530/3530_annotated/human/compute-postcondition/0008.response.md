The code appends a list of integers to `a`, where the integers are obtained from user input. The function `raw_input()` accepts input as a string, and `map(int, ...)` converts each space-separated string in the input to an integer. Since `a` initially contains integers from user input, it will now be updated to include these new integers from the current input.

The previous state of `a` is not specified, but the result after execution will be that `a` now contains its original values along with the new integers from the input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains its original integers plus new integers from user input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a string representation of a positive integer greater than 2**.
