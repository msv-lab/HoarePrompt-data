The operation `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. 

1. The variable `mask` is `1 << n`, which is a bitwise left shift of 1 by `n` positions.
2. The variable `j` is 0, so `1 << j` is `1`.
3. The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` evaluates to `mask ^ 1`, which toggles the least significant bit of `mask` if it was set.
4. The value `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is accessed, which depends on the previously computed values in the `dp` array.

The `mask` is non-zero, and since `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, it indicates that the value at that position is valid for processing, implying that the addition to `dp[i][mask]` is meaningful.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mask` is `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
