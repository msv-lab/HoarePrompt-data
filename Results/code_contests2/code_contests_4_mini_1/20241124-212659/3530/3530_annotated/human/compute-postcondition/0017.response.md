`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `i` is `2`, so `dp[0][2]` is now `1`. The previous values of `dp[0][0]` and `dp[0][1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a valid positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is now 1, `dp[0][1]` is now 1, and `dp[0][2]` is now 1.

Output State: **`n` is a valid positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is now 1, `dp[0][1]` is now 1, `dp[0][2]` is now 1**
