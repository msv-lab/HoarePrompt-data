The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0,
- `mask` is 1,
- `j` is 0,
- The element at position `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1,
- The bitwise AND operation between `mask` (which is 1) and `1 << j` (which is also 1 since `j` is 0) results in a non-zero value.

Now, we need to understand what happens:
- `mask ^ 1 << j` results in `mask ^ 1` (since `1 << j` is 1), which will toggle the least significant bit of `mask`. Given `mask` is 1 (binary `01`), `mask ^ 1` becomes 0 (binary `00`).
- The expression updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][0]` (since `mask ^ 1 << j` equals `0`).

If we denote `dp[i][mask]` as having some value before this operation, it will now be increased by whatever value exists at `dp[i - 1][0]`. 

Therefore, the output state is:
- The specific values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][0]` are not known, but we know that `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0; `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][0]`**
