Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop will iterate `n` times with `j` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the corresponding bit in `mask` is set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If `n` is 0 or if `i` is greater than `n`, the loop will not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` will remain unchanged. Also, if none of the conditions are satisfied during any iteration, `dp[i][mask]` will not be updated from its previous state.**
