Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the contributions from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` for each valid `j` where `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the corresponding bit in `mask` is set. If `n` is at least 1 and there are valid `j` indices, `dp[i][mask]` will reflect the sum of those contributions taken modulo `MOD`. If `n` is 0 or less, or if none of the conditions for any `j` hold true, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
