Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1 and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` with `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the value is taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
