According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `mask` ranging from 1 to `1 << n` (which is equivalent to \(2^n\)). Since `n` is greater than 0, `1 << n` will be at least 2, meaning the loop will execute at least once. 

The variable `i` being less than or equal to `n` does not directly affect the execution of the loop; it may be used within the loop but does not need adjustment for the loop to start.

Therefore, the initial states need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and that `mask` is initialized at the beginning of the loop (which will start at 1). 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than or equal to n, `mask` is 1**
