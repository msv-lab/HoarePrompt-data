Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, `j` iterates from 0 to `n - 1`. If for each `j`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If for any `j`, `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or `mask & 1 << j` is false, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
