Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition that if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
