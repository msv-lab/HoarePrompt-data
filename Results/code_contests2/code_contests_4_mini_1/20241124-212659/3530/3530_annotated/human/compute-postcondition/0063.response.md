According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

Additionally, since the loop can execute again only if `j` is still less than `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to run again (as `j` would be 2, and it needs to be less than `n`). 

State: **`mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`; `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `j` is 2**
