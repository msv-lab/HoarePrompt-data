Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0. If the element at `a[0][0]` is 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taken modulo `MOD`. If the element at `a[0][0]` is not 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
