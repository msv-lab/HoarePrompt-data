According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop continues while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. Additionally, since we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `n`, we must adjust `n` to be greater than 2 to allow one more iteration.

State: **`mask` is `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2**
