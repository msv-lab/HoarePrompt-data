According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the variable `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. Thus, the conditions for executing the loop again are that `n` must be greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition that `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2**
