Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0. If the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` is satisfied and `mask` has the bit corresponding to `j` set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
