Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]`, `mask`, and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for every `j` in the range of `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly. If `mask` does not match or `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 for all `j`, the loop will not execute and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains as it was before entering the loop.**
