The operation `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value in the `dp` array at the index `[i][mask]`. The value of `mask` is `1 << n`, which is a bitwise left shift of `1` by `n` positions, resulting in `2^n`. The value of `j` is `2`, so `1 << j` gives `4`, and `mask ^ 1 << j` computes the bitwise XOR between `mask` and `4`.

The state of `dp[i][mask]` will increase by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 4]`. The values of `n` and `j` are known, but the specific values in the `dp` array depend on previous context not provided.

Thus, the output state is: `mask` is `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous values in the `dp` array.

Output State: **`mask` is `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 4]`**
