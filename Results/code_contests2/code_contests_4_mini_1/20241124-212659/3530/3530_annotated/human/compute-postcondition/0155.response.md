According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over `mask` from 1 to `1 << n - 1`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is implied that `n` was greater than 0 for the loop to have executed previously. However, since we need to adjust for the next iteration, we should check the state of `mask`.

The current `mask` value at the end of the last iteration is less than `1 << n`, so to execute the loop one more time, `mask` needs to be incremented. Therefore, we need to adjust `mask` to the next value, which would be `mask + 1`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the number of valid `j` indices where `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` contains the bit corresponding to `j`, `mask` is incremented by 1**
