Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, and `j` is 0, if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or if `mask` AND `1 << j` is false, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
