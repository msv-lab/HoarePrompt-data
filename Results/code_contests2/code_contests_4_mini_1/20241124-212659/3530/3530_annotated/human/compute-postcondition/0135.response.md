The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it will now be adjusted to ensure it remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The other variables, `n`, `mask`, and `j`, remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated and now holds the value of `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated and now holds the value of `dp[i][mask] % MOD**
