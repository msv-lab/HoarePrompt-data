According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `j` should become 2.

Since `j` is the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, no other states need to be modified.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 2**
