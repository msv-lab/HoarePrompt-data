The statement `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variables involved are `dp`, `mask`, and `j`. 

- `mask` is computed as `1 << n`, which is a bitwise left shift of `1` by `n` positions, and since `n` is greater than 0, `mask` will be at least `2` (if `n` is `1`).
- The value of `j` is `1`, so `1 << j` equals `2`.
- The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` effectively toggles the j-th bit of `mask`.

The previous state of the affected variables is:
- `n` is greater than 0,
- `mask` is equal to `1 << n`,
- `j` is `1`.

After executing the statement, `dp[i][mask]` will be modified based on the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]`, but since we don't have the specific values of `dp`, we cannot definitively state the outcome of that update.

Therefore, the output state remains focused on the values of `n`, `mask`, and `j`, while acknowledging that `dp[i][mask]` has been updated.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]**.
