According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3 because it needs to be less than `n`. Hence, we need to adjust `j` to 3.

Since `n` is greater than 1, it does not need to be adjusted further, as `n` being greater than 1 allows for `j` to be 2 and 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 3**
