Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise ANDed with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and subsequently, `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
