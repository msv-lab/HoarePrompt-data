The code updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then applies the modulo operation with `MOD` to `dp[i][mask]`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `dp[i][mask]` will change based on the provided expression, while the other variables remain unaffected. The modulo operation will ensure that the value of `dp[i][mask]` stays within the bounds defined by `MOD`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] % MOD`, `mask` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] % MOD`, `mask` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero**.
