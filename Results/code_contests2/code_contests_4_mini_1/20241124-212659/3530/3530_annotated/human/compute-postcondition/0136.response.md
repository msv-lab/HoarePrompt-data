Postcondition: ***Given `n` is greater than 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 2, if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise ANDed with `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
