The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` (which is not given) and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This operation restricts `dp[i][mask]` to be within the range defined by `MOD`, ensuring that the value does not exceed this limit. The other variables' values are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the value of `dp[i][mask]` after the modulo operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
