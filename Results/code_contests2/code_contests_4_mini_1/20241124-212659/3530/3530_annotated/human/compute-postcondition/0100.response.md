The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is being modified. The other variables `n` and `j` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `j`, along with the modified state of `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`**
