Output State: **`mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` can take values from 0 to `n - 1`; if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` and taking modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met for all values of `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
