According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` in relation to `n`. The loop will iterate over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` can be assumed to be `n - 1` since it is the last valid index for the loop to execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `n`, which is out of the range defined by the loop.

Since `j` is at its maximum value of `n - 1`, no conditions related to `dp`, `a`, or `mask` change; therefore, the only adjustment needed is to account for the out-of-range index.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition that if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`, and `j` is `n`**
