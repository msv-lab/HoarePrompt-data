Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition that `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero; specifically, if these conditions are met, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the bitwise AND condition is not satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. The value of `n` being greater than 2 is also relevant contextually, but does not directly affect this specific update operation.***
