According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2, and `j` should be incremented to 2. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are that `n` must be greater than 1, `j` should be 2, and we do not need to adjust the `mask` variable.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2**
