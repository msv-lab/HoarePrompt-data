According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to 3. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `n` is only required to be greater than `j` for the loop to execute again, and the other states do not change.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, and `j` is 3**
