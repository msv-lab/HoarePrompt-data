Postcondition: ***`mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 0; if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it and taking modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
