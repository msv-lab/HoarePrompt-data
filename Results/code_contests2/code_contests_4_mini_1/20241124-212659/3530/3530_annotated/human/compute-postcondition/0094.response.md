According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will iterate for `j` from 0 up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, which means that the loop can execute again as long as `j` can be incremented.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, it is valid for `j` to take the value 1 in the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted since `mask` remains valid and `a[i - 1][j]` will be evaluated based on the new value of `j`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, `j` is 1**
