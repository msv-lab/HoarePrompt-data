Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1, if the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` is true and the bitwise operation `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, followed by taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is false, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
