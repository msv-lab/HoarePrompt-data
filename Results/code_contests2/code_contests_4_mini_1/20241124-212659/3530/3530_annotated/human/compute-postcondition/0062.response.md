Postcondition: ***`mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 1; if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
