The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value modulo `MOD`. The values of `n`, `mask`, `j`, and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]` are not directly affected by this operation, as `dp[i][mask]` is simply modified. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial values of all variables involved, while also indicating the operation performed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, `j` is 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
