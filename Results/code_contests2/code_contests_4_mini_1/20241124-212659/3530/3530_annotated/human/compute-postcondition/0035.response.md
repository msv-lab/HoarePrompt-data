According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. The loop variable `j` starts at 2 for this iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be set to 3. However, the loop can only execute if `j` is less than `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 3.

No other states need to be adjusted as `i`, `mask`, and `n` are already in the correct state for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 3**
