The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. Given that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than or equal to `n`, we can deduce that both `i` and `mask` are valid indices for the `dp` array. The specific values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` are not provided, but it's clear that the statement updates `dp[i][mask]` based on a previous state from the `dp` array. The values of `n`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the state of `dp[i][mask]` depends on the prior value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it.**
