According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, inclusive, meaning that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently equal to a value between 1 and `n`, and `mask` is unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and it should still be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`. 

Since `n` is at least 1, it must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` for the loop to execute again. Given that we need to ensure that the loop can run once more, we conclude that `n` needs to be updated to reflect that it is at least `i + 1`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is at least `i + 1`**
