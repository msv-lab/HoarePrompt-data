The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are necessary to understand the impact on `dp[i][mask]`. However, since the exact values are not provided, we can only state that the operation is performed.

The output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` has been modified but does not specify the exact new value since it depends on the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its value modulo `MOD`**
