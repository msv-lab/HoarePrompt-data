According to the code, the for loop executes over the variable `mask`, which iterates from `1` to `1 << n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `mask` must still be within this range. Since the last value of `mask` at the end of the previous iteration would be `mask`, the next value of `mask` should be incremented.

At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is at its maximum value of `1 << n` (which equals `2^n`). To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `mask` needs to be adjusted to ensure it will be less than `1 << n`. Since the loop starts from `1`, the smallest value for `mask` to execute again is `1`.

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `mask` is now `1` as it will be the first value in the next iteration of the loop. The value of `n` remains the same, and no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and the bitwise representation of `mask`, `n` is greater than 0, mask is 1**
