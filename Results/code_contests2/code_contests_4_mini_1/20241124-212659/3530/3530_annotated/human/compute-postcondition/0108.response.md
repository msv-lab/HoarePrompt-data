The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask]` and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The values of `n`, `mask`, `j`, and `dp` remain unchanged, and there is no return statement affecting the state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, `j` is 0, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying modulo with `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, `j` is 0, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying modulo with `MOD**.
