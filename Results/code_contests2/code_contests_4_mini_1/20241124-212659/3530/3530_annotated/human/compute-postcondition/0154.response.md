Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the number of valid `j` indices where `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` contains the bit corresponding to `j`. If there are valid indices, `dp[i][mask]` will reflect the sum of contributions from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for each valid `j`, taken modulo `MOD`. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` will remain unchanged.**
