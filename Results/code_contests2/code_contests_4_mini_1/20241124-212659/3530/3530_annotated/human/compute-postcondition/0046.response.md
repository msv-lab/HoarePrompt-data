Postcondition: ***`mask` is `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the value of `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If either condition is not met (i.e., `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set), then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
