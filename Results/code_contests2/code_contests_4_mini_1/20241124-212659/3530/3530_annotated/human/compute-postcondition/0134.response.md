The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. Given the initial state, we know that `mask` is 1 and `j` is 2. The expression `1 << j` computes to `4` (since `1 << 2` shifts the binary representation of `1` two places to the left, resulting in `100` in binary).

Now, we need to calculate `mask ^ 1 << j`, which is `1 ^ 4`. The operation results in `5` (in binary: `0001 ^ 0100 = 0101`).

The specific values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are not provided, but we know that `dp[i][mask]` will be updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][5]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][5]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][5]**
