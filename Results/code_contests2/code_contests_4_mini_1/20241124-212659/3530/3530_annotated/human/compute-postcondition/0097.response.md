Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, `mask` equals `1 << n`, and `j` equals 1, then if the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` is true, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is false, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
