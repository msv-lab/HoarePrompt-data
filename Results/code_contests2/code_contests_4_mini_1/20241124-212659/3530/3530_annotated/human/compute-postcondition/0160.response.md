Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition that `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero. Specifically, if these conditions hold, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. Additionally, `mask` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or the bitwise AND condition is not satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
