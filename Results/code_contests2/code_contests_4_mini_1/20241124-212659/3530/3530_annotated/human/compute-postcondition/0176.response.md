The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly in its definition. However, it operates on a positive integer `N`, which must satisfy the constraint 1 <= N <= 21, and a 2D list `a` of integers. Each element `a[i][j]` in this list represents the compatibility between man `i` and woman `j`, where each element is either 0 or 1. The function processes this data and outputs a result based on the compatibility information provided in the 2D list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate on a positive integer `N` and a 2D list `a` of integers representing compatibility, and it produces a result based on this information. 

Functionality: **The function operates on a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list a of integers (0 or 1) representing compatibility between men and women, returning a result based on this compatibility.**
