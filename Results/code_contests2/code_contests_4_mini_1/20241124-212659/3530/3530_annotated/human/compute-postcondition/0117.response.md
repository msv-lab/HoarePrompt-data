Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, and this result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met (either `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set), `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
