According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `2`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `3`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Since `j` is currently `2`, it can be incremented to `3` for the next iteration. However, since `n` is only guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `3`, we need to ensure that `j` does not exceed `n - 1`. Therefore, we need to modify the state to reflect that `j` is now `3`, and we must ensure that `n` is at least `4` to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`; `n` is greater than or equal to 4; `j` is 3**
