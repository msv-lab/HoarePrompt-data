Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute exactly n times, with j taking values from 0 to n-1. During each iteration, if the element at `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If either condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If n is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
