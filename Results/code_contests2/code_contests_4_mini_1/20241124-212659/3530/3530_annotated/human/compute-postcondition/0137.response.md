According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 3. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `n` being greater than 1 does not restrict the loop from executing again, and the conditions related to `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask` are not directly relevant to the loop's ability to continue.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 3**
