According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates over `mask` in the range from `1` to `1 << n`, which means it will execute for `mask` values from `1` to `2^n - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`, which is the maximum value for `mask` in this scenario, given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be incremented to the next value, which would be `1 << n`. However, `1 << n` is not included in the range of the loop since the loop's max value is `1 << n - 1`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again with the current state.

Additionally, since `n` is stated to be greater than or equal to 1, it remains unchanged for the next iteration.

Given that the loop cannot execute again, there are no states to adjust as the conditions for continuation are not met.

State: **`mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` can take values from 0 to `n - 1`**
