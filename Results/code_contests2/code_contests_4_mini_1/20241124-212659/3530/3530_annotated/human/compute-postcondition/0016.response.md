According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `1 << n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a valid positive integer greater than 0. 

Since `n` is greater than 0, `1 << n` is at least 2 (specifically, it equals 2 when n is 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. 

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `i` should be 2, which is the next value for the loop to execute again.
- `n` remains a valid positive integer greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a valid positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is now 1, `dp[0][1]` is now 1**
