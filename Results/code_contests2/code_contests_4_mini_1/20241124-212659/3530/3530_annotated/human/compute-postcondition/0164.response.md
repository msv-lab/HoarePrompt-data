Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition that `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero. If this condition holds true, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. This operation takes place under the precondition that `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is 1, ensuring that the updates to `dp[i][mask]` are consistent with these criteria. There is no else part in the code.***
