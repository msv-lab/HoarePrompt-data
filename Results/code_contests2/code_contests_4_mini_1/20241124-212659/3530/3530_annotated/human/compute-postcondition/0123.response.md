According to the code, the loop will execute for `mask` values ranging from 1 to `1 << n` (which is 2^n - 1). For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, ensuring that the range will include at least the value 1. 

Before the loop starts, the variable `mask` is not initialized, but it will be set to 1 at the beginning of the first iteration. The conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and the bitwise representation of `mask` are not directly relevant to whether the loop can execute since they relate to the loop body rather than the loop initialization.

So, to summarize: `n` must be greater than 0, and at the start of the loop, `mask` is initialized to 1. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1**
