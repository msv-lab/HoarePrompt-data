Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, reads `n` lines of input containing lists of integers (0 or 1) representing compatibility between pairs, and calculates a value based on this compatibility using a dynamic programming approach. It returns the accumulated value from the last row of the dynamic programming table for the complete mask of pairs. If `n` is not a valid positive integer, the function will not execute as intended, and the result will not be computed. **
