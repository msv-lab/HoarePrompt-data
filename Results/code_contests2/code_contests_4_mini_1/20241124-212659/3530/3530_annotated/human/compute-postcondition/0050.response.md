Postcondition: ***`mask` is `1 << n`, where `n` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, followed by taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
