According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates for `mask` in the range from `1` to `1 << n`, which means that it will execute if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is `1 << n`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `mask` needs to be within the range `1` to `1 << n`, specifically, it needs to be less than `1 << n`. Currently, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, which means that it is at its upper limit and will not execute again.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` should be adjusted to `1 << n - 1` (the last valid value before reaching `1 << n`), and `n` must remain the same. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`mask` is `1 << n - 1`, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and the j-th bit of `mask`, `n` is unchanged**
