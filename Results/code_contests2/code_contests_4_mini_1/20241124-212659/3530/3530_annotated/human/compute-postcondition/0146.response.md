The operation updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The variable `j` holds the value of `n`, which is used to compute `1 << j` (a left bitwise shift operation). The bitwise XOR operation `mask ^ 1 << j` modifies the `mask` variable based on the shifted value.

Since `dp[i][mask]` is directly updated, its previous value is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The other variables (`i`, `mask`, and `n`) are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `j` is `n`**.
