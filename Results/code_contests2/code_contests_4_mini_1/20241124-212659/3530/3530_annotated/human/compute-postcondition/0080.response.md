The code updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulo of its current value with `MOD`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` before this operation is the result of adding `dp[i - 1][3]`. Since `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than or equal to `n`, it implies that `dp[i][mask]` is being modified based on previous states of the `dp` array. The exact numerical values are not provided, but the output state reflects the operation performed.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo with `MOD`**.
