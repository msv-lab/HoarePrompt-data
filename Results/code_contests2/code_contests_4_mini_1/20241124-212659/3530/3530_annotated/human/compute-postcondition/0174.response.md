Output State: **If n is a valid positive integer greater than 0, then `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on contributions from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` for each valid `j` where `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the corresponding bit in `mask` is set. After executing the loop, `dp[n][mask]` will contain the accumulated values calculated modulo `MOD` for all masks from 1 to (1 << n) - 1. If n is 0 or not a valid positive integer, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged with one list containing a single zero. Additionally, if for all iterations of j, either `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set, `dp[i][mask]` will not be updated for that mask.**
