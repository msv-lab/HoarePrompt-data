According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since it is stated that `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. The loop will iterate `n` times, starting with `j` at 0 and incrementing by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n-1`. 

Before the loop starts, it is important to note the initial values of `j` and `mask`. Since `j` starts at 0 and increments, we need to set `j` to 0 before the loop begins. The value of `mask` is calculated based on `n`, which is already provided as `1 << n`.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the following states are relevant:
- `n` remains greater than 0,
- `j` is initialized to 0,
- `mask` is equal to `1 << n`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n, `j` is 0**
