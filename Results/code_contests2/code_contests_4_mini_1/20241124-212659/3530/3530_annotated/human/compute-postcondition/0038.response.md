According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 0, as `range(n)` generates a sequence from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `j` will take on values starting from 0. 

Since `mask` is defined as `1 << n`, it implies that `n` should be a non-negative integer. However, `mask` itself does not affect the execution of the loop directly aside from indicating a valid value for `n`. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, meaning `j` will start at 0. 

State: **`mask` is `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
