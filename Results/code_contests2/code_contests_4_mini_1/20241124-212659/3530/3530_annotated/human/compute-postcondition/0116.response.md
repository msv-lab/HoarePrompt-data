The line of code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is affected by the update, but other variables remain unchanged. The exact value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified based on its current value and the modulus operation.

Since `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is calculated as `1 << n`, which means it is a power of 2 greater than or equal to 2 (depending on the value of `n`). The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` would be updated based on the previous computation involving `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous state of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)] with MOD applied.**
