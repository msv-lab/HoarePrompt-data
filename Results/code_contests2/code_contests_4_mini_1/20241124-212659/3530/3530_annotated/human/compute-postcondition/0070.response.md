Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the outer loop executes (1 << n) - 1 times, iterating through all possible masks from 1 to (1 << n) - 1. For each mask, the inner loop executes n times, with j taking values from 0 to n - 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` modulo `MOD`. If n is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged from its initial value. If for all iterations of j, either `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set, `dp[i][mask]` does not change for that mask.**
