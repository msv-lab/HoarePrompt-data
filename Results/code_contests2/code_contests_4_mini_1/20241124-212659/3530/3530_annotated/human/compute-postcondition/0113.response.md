Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
