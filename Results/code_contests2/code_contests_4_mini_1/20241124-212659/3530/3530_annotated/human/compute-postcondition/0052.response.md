Output State: **`mask` is `1 << n`, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and the j-th bit of `mask`. The loop executes `n` times if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If for any iteration `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set, `dp[i][mask]` does not change for that iteration.**
