According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted since `n` remains greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, `j` is 1**
