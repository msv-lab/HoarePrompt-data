The statement `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `mask` is equal to `1 << n`.
- `j` is 0.
- The element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1.
- The bitwise AND operation of `mask` and `1 << j` results in a non-zero value, implying that the j-th bit of `mask` is set.

The code will modify the `dp` table at index `i` and `mask`, but we do not have the specific values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to determine the exact effect on `dp[i][mask]`. 

Therefore, the output state indicates that `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the addition of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, but the exact values are not available.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `mask` is equal to `1 << n`; `j` is 0; `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**.
