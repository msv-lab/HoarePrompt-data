According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from `0` to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`, and since `n` is greater than or equal to `1`, there is potential for the loop to execute again.

To execute one more time, `j` needs to be `1` at the start of the next iteration. Since `n` is still greater than or equal to `1`, it allows for the value of `j` to be `1`. 

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `j`.

State: **`mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 1**
