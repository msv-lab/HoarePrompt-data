Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and the bitwise representation of `mask`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes `n` times, with `j` taking values from 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` accumulates the value `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or if `mask & (1 << j)` is false for all iterations, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains in its initial state.**
