According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, which is less than `n` for the loop to continue. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since there are no other variables that need to be adjusted in the context provided, the state can be updated accordingly.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition that if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`; j is now equal to the next integer (j + 1)**
