According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is stated to be greater than 0, the loop will indeed execute. Before the loop starts, `mask` is 1 and this variable does not affect the execution of the loop itself. 

At the beginning of the loop, the loop variable `j` will start at 0 (the first value in the range) and will iterate until it reaches `n - 1`. Therefore, there are no adjustments needed for `j` as it will be initialized by the loop itself.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0**
