Postcondition: ***`mask` is `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` holds true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, all taken modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or `mask & 1 << j` is false, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
