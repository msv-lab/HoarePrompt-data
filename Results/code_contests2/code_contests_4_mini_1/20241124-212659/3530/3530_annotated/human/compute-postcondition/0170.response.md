Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the number of valid `j` indices where `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the corresponding bit in `mask` is set. After the loop executes, if `n` is at least 1, `j` will be 0, 1, or 2, up to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` will be incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, and this value will be taken modulo `MOD`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. Additionally, if none of the conditions for any `j` hold true, `dp[i][mask]` will remain unchanged throughout the loop.**
