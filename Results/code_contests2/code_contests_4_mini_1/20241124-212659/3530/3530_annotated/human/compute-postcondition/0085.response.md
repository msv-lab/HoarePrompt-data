Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
