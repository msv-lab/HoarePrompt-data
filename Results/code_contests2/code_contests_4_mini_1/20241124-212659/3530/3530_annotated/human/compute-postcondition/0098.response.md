According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop is designed to iterate from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `2`. Additionally, `n` must be greater than `1` to allow the loop to run once more.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than `1` and that `j` is now `2`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2**
