According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1.

State: **`mask` is `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
