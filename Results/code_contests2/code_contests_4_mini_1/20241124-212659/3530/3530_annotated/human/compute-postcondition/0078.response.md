According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, which allows the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted since it is already greater than 0, and `i` is less than or equal to `n`, so it is not affected by this loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1**
