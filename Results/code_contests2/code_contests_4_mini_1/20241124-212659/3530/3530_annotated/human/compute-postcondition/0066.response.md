Postcondition: ***`mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`; `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `j` is 2; if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo MOD. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
