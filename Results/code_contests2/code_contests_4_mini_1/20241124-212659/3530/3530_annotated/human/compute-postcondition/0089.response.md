According to the code, for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variable `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once, iterating from `j = 0` to `j = n - 1`. The initial state of `mask` being equal to `1 << n` does not affect the loop's execution itself, but it is important to note that it will hold a value based on the value of `n`. 

At the start of the first iteration, `j` would be initialized to 0. Therefore, to summarize the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, `j` is 0**
