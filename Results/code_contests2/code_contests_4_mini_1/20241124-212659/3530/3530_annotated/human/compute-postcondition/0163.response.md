The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and performing a modulus operation with `MOD`. This means that `dp[i][mask]` is assigned the value of `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are affected, but the values of other variables (`mask`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after the modulus operation, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the modulus operation with `MOD`, `mask` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1**
