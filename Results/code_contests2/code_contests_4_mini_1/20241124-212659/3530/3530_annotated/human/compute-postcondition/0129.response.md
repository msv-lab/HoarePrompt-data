According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to 1. The state of `n` does not need to be adjusted since it is already greater than 0, which allows the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1**
