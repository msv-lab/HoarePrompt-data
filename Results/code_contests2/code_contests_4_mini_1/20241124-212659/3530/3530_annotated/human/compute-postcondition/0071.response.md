According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop executes for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than 0, which means that the loop has executed at least once. The variable `i` will have been incremented to the next value. 

To determine the new state for the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to reflect that it is now ready to iterate again. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.

Since the loop starts with `i` equal to 1 and continues up to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Thus, we should adjust `i` to `i + 1`.

The state needs to reflect that `i` has been incremented by 1, while `n` remains unchanged. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than or equal to n**
