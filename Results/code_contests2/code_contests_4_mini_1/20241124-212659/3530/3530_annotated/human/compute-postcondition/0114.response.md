According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute for values of `j` starting from 1 and going up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, `j` is 2**
