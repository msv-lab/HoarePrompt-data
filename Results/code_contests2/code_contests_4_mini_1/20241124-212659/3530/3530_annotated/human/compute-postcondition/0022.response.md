According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. The variable `j` will start at 0 in the first iteration due to the `range(n)` function. The initial values of `i` and `mask` do not impact the execution of the loop directly. Therefore, for the loop to be executed correctly, `j` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0**
