According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. 

After the current iteration with `j` being 0, for the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` should be adjusted to 1. There are no other states that need to be adjusted as `i` and `mask` will remain the same, and the condition for the loop will still hold.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1**
