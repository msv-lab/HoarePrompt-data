According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from `j = 0` and ending at `j = n - 1`. 

The variable `mask` is set to `1 << (n - 1)`, which means it is calculated based on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 to ensure that the range of `j` is valid. 

Before the loop starts, `mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`, and `j` will start at 0. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the initial value of `j` is 0. 

State: **`mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0**
