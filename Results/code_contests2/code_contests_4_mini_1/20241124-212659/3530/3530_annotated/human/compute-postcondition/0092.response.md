The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `n`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` after the update operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `mask` is equal to `1 << n`; `j` is 0; `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**.
