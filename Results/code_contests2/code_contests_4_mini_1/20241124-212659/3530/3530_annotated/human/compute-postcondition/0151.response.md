The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is updated to ensure that it remains within the bounds set by `MOD`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
