According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates through `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, it is implied that `j` has reached its maximum value of `n - 1`. Therefore, to allow the loop to run one more time, `j` should be adjusted to `n`.

No other states need to be adjusted as the conditions for `dp` updates are based on the values of `i`, `mask`, and the contents of `a` and `dp`, which do not change with this iteration.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated as described, `j` is `n`**
