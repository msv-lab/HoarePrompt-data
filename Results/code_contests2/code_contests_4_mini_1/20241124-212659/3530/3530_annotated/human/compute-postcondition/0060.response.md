The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. Here, `mask` is defined as `1 << (n - 1)` and `j` is 1. 

To analyze the effect:
- The value of `mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`, which is a bitwise left shift operation that results in a binary number with a `1` in the position corresponding to `n - 1` and `0s` elsewhere.
- The expression `1 << j` where `j` is 1 results in `2`, which is `10` in binary.
- The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` computes the new mask by performing a bitwise XOR between the current `mask` and `2`.

As a result, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated, but the specific values of the `dp` array and the indices are not provided. The other variables (`mask`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions.

Output State: **`mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]`.**
