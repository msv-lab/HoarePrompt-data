To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the implementation against the problem description and the examples given.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires counting the number of ways to pair N men with N women based on a compatibility matrix. Each man can only pair with compatible women, as indicated by a binary matrix where a value of 1 means compatibility and a value of 0 means incompatibility.

### Code Review:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input consists of an integer N followed by N lines of N integers each, representing the compatibility matrix.
   - The compatibility matrix is stored correctly as a list of lists.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - A dynamic programming table `dp` is initialized where `dp[i][mask]` represents the number of ways to pair the first `i` men with the set of women represented by `mask`.
   - The size of `dp` is `(n + 1) x (1 << n)`, which is appropriate for the given constraints.

3. **Base Case**:
   - `dp[0][i]` is initialized to 1 for all `i`, which correctly indicates that there is one way to pair zero men (by not pairing anyone).

4. **DP Transition**:
   - The nested loops iterate over the men, the masks (which represent women that can still be paired), and the specific women.
   - The condition checks if a man can pair with a woman (if compatible and if the woman is still available based on the mask). 
   - If they are compatible, it updates the DP table based on previously computed states, which is a valid approach.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The output is `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]`, which corresponds to all men paired with all women.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not correctly handle the possibility where N could be 0. The input specification seems to imply that N is always at least 1. However, if N were to be 0, the program could give incorrect results, as the DP table would not be initialized properly for that case.
- The input reading uses `input()` and `raw_input()` inconsistently. In Python 3, `raw_input()` should be replaced with `input()`, and the map should be converted to list explicitly for proper storage. 

### Example Testing:
- The provided examples all lead to correct outputs based on the compatibility matrix.
- However, if we consider edge cases such as:
  - Input with all zeros (no compatibility), which should return 0.
  - Input of size 1 with no compatibility, which should return 0.
  - Input of size 1 with compatibility, which should return 1.
  
The code does handle these cases correctly based on the examples provided.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the codes and analyzing potential edge cases, the logic appears to handle the requirements properly given that `N` is always at least 1. The core functionality and the dynamic programming approach used is sound as it calculates the number of ways to pair men and women based on compatibility.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
