The function accepts an integer input `n` (which must be an even integer between 2 and 50) and a list of integers `digits` from standard input. It checks if the sum of the first half of `digits` equals the sum of the second half. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly validate that `digits` contains only lucky digits (4 and 7), and also does not handle any potential exceptions from invalid input types.
