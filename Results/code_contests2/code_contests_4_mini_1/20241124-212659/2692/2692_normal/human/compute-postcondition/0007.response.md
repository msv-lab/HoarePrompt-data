Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `digits` is a mapped iterator of integers from input. If the sum of the first half of the elements in `digits` (up to `n / 2`) is equal to the sum of the elements in `digits` from `n / 2 + n % 2` to the end, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.***
