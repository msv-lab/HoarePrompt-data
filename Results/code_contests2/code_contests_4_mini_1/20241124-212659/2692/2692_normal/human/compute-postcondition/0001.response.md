The variable `n` is assigned the value obtained from `raw_input().strip()`, which converts the input into a string and then strips any leading or trailing whitespace before converting it to an integer. Since `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 in the initial state, the input must respect this condition. The program does not modify any other variables or states. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and it is assigned a new input integer value.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and it is assigned a new input integer value**
