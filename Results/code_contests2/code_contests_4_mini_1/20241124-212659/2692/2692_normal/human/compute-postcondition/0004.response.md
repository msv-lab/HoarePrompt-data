Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `digits` is a mapped iterator of integers from input; the sum of the first half of the elements in `digits` up to `n / 2` is equal to the sum of the elements in `digits` starting from `n / 2 + n % 2` to the end; and the program prints 'YES'.**
