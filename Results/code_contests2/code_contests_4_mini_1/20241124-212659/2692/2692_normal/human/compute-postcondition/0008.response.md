Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `digits` is a list of integers consisting only of lucky digits (4 and 7). If the sum of the first half of `digits` (up to `n / 2`) is equal to the sum of the second half of `digits` (from `n / 2 + n % 2` to the end), the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This accounts for cases where the ticket number consists of leading zeros or different distributions of lucky digits, ensuring that the sums of both halves are evaluated correctly.***
