Correctness: **False**

The program has a couple of issues that lead to incorrect results based on the problem description:

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The program does not check if all digits of the ticket number are either 4 or 7. According to the problem description, a ticket is only considered lucky if it consists solely of these lucky digits. The current implementation skips this check entirely.

2. **Sum Comparison Logic**: The sum comparison logic contains an error. The slicing for the second half of the digits is incorrect. It should be `digits[n // 2:]`, but it uses `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]`, which would cause an off-by-one error when checking sums.

3. **Output**: The program outputs "YES" or "NO" based only on the sum comparison. If the ticket number contains any digits other than 4 or 7, it should output "NO" immediately, but this is not handled.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
- Input: 
    ```
    4
    1234
    ```
- Expected Output: "NO" (because the digits are not lucky).
- Actual Output: "NO" (but the program does not actually validate the lucky digits).

This indicates that there could be more cases that might not be handled properly. For example:
- Input:
    ```
    6
    474474
    ```
- Expected Output: "YES" (it has only lucky digits and sums are equal).
- If any digits other than 4 or 7 were present, the program would incorrectly assume it could still return "YES" based solely on sum equality.

Thus, the lack of validation for lucky digits causes the program to potentially yield incorrect results.
