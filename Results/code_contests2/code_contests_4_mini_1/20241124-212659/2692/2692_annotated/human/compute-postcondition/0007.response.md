Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `digits` is a collection of integers. If the sum of the first half of the `digits` up to `n/2` is equal to the sum of the second half from `n/2 + n % 2` onward, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This accounts for cases where `n` is at its minimum value of 2 or maximum value of 50, and whether the sums of the two halves of `digits` are equal or not.***
