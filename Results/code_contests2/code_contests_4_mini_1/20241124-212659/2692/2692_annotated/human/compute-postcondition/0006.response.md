The code will print the string 'NO'. The previous values of `n` and `digits` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `digits`, as well as the output produced by the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `digits` is a collection of integers, and the function prints 'NO'**
