Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `digits` is a collection of integers containing exactly `n` digits of either 4 or 7. If the sum of the first half of `digits` (up to `n/2`) is equal to the sum of the second half (from `n/2 + n % 2` onward), 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This ensures that all possible cases are considered, including the minimum and maximum values of `n`, as well as the potential equality or inequality of the sums of the two halves of `digits`.***
