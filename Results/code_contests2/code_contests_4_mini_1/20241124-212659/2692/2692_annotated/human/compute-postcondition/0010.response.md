Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from input, which must be an even integer between 2 and 50, and then reads `n` digits. It checks if the sum of the first half of these digits is equal to the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is not within the specified range or if the digits are not provided, the function does not handle these cases explicitly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. **
