`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input string, and `int()` converts that string into an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an even integer within the range of 2 to 50. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` is now set to this input integer value, while the properties of the ticket number remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50**
