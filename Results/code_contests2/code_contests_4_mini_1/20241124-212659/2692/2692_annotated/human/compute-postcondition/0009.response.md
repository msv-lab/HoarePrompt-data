The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as its signature indicates no input parameters. The constraints specify that `n` is an even integer within the range of 2 to 50, and the ticket number is a positive integer that has exactly `n` digits, composed solely of the digits 4 and 7. After executing the function body, it evaluates the ticket number and returns a boolean value indicating whether the ticket number is considered lucky or not based on the presence of the specified digits.

Functionality: **The function checks a ticket number with exactly n digits (where n is an even integer between 2 and 50) consisting only of the digits 4 and 7, and returns whether the ticket is lucky based on specific criteria.**
