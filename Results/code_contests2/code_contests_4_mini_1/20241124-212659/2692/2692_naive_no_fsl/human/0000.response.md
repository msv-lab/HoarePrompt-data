Correctness: **False**

The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly following the problem description:

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The program does not check if the ticket number contains only the lucky digits (4 and 7). According to the problem, a ticket is only lucky if it consists solely of these digits.

2. **Incorrect Slicing**: The slicing for the second half of the digits is incorrect. The expression `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]` does not correctly obtain the second half of the digits. Instead, it should be simply `digits[n / 2:]` to get the second half of the list.

3. **Output Logic**: The program only checks if the sums of the two halves are equal, without considering whether the entire ticket is a lucky number.

For example, for the input:
```
4
4747
```
This should output "YES" because it is a lucky number and the sums of both halves are equal. However, if the input is:
```
4
1234
```
The program will incorrectly output "NO" without checking the lucky number condition.

Because the program does not handle these critical checks, it fails to meet the problem's requirements.
