Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the ticket number is a lucky ticket according to the problem description. 

1. It fails to check if all digits of the ticket are either '4' or '7', which is a requirement for the ticket number to be considered a lucky number. 
2. The condition `sum(digits[:n / 2]) == sum(digits[n / 2 + n % 2:])` incorrectly slices the second half of the digits. The correct slicing should be `digits[n / 2:]` instead of `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]`.

For example, for the input:
```
4
4744
```
The ticket is a lucky number since it contains only '4' and '7', and the sums of the first half (4 + 7 = 11) and the second half (4 + 4 = 8) are not equal. However, the program would incorrectly produce "NO" because it does not check for lucky digits, and its slicing logic is flawed.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
