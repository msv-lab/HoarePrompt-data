The value of `b` is assigned to 0. This does not change the value of `a` or `res` directly, but we note that `b` is now 0. The previous value of `a` remains the same as it was before this assignment, and `res` has already been increased by 1 prior to this code execution. Therefore, the output state indicates the new value of `b` and the unchanged values of `a` and `res`.

Output State: **`a` is updated to `a - (0 + 1) * v`, `res` is increased by 1, `b` is 0**
