Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-negative integer that may be less than `k`, `v` is a positive integer, and `res` is 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v` and `b` is decreased by `(k - 1)`. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is 0 or negative, `a` is decreased by `v`, while `b` remains unchanged (non-negative). All cases maintain the positivity of `v` and the initial values of `k` and `res`.***
