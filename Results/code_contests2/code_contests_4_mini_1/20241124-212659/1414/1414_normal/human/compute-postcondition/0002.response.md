The value of `res` is incremented by 1, and since `res` was initially 0, after execution, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a positive integer, and `res` is 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a positive integer, and `res` is 1**
