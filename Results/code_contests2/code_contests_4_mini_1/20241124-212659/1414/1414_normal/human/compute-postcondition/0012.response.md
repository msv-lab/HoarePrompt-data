Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is a positive integer. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` becomes 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`, while `b` remains a negative integer (less than `k`), `v` is a positive integer, and `res` is still 1.***
