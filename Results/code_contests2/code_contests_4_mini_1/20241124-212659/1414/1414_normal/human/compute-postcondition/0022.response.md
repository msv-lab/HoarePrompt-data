Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than `v` and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is reduced by `k * v` and `b` is decreased by `(k - 1)`. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is updated to `a - v`. In all cases, `res` remains increased by 1 after the execution of the program fragment.***
