Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than `v`, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is updated to `a - v`. In both cases, `res` remains increased by 1 after the execution of the program fragment.***
