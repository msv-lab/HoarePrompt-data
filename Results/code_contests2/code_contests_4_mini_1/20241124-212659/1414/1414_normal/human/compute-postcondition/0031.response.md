Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than `k * v` and has decreased by either `k * v`, `(b + 1) * v`, or `v` based on the value of `b`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, it is updated to `b - (k - 1)`. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, it is set to 0. If `b` is equal to 0, it remains 0. In all cases, `res` is increased by 1.***
