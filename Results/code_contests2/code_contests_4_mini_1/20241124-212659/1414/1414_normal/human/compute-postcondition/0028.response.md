The variable `b` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state indicates that `b` was greater than or equal to `0`, so this assignment does not change the validity of the initial state. The other variables `a` and `res` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is now decreased by (0 + 1) * v, `b` is 0, `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is now decreased by (0 + 1) * v, `b` is 0, `res` is increased by 1**
