The variables `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are assigned the values from the input, where the input is a space-separated string of integers converted to integers using `int()`. The previous values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are not known, but they will now hold specific integer values based on the input provided. Since the initial state indicates that `k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, and `v` is a positive integer, the output state will reflect these new assignments.

Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a positive integer, and they are assigned values from input.**
