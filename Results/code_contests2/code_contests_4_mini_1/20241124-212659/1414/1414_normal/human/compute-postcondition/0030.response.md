Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than `k * v`. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v`, `b` is set to 0, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`, and `res` is still increased by 1. In both cases, `res` is increased by 1 and `a` remains greater than `k * v` after the operation.***
