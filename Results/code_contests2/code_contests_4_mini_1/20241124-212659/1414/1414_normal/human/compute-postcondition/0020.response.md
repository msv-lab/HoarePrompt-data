The value of `a` is updated by subtracting `v` from it. Since `a` is greater than `v`, the result of `a - v` will be a positive value. The value of `res` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is now `a - v`, `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is now `a - v`, `res` is increased by 1**
