The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. The value of `a` is greater than `v`, and the state of `a` and `v` is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is greater than `v`, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is greater than `v`, and `res` is increased by 1**
