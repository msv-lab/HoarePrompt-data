The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)` from its current value. The previous value of `b` is unknown, but it will be decreased by the quantity `(k - 1)`. The states of the other variables (`a` and `res`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is reduced by `k * v`, `res` is increased by 1, and `b` is decreased by `(k - 1)`.

Output State: **`a` is reduced by `k * v`, `res` is increased by 1, and `b` is decreased by `(k - 1)`**
