The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)` from it. Given that `b` is a non-negative integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, this operation will reduce `b` but will not make it negative since `k` is at least 2. Therefore, `b` will change, while the other variables (`k`, `a`, `v`, and `res`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is updated to a - k * v, `b` is updated to b - (k - 1), `v` is a positive integer, and `res` is 1**
