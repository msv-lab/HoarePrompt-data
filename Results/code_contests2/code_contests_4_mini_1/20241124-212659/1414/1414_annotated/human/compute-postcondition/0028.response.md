The assignment `b = 0` sets the value of `b` to 0. The other variables `k`, `a`, `res`, and `v` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than 0, `b` is 0, `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than 0, `b` is 0, `res` is increased by 1**
