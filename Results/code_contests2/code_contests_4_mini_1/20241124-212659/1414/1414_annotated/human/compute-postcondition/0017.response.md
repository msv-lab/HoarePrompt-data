The value of `b` is decreased by `(k - 1)`. Since `b` is a non-negative integer within the range (0 ≤ b ≤ 1000) and `k` is an integer with a minimum value of 2, the new value of `b` will be calculated as `b - (k - 1)`. The state of other variables (`a`, `v`, `res`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `b`.

Output State: **`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `b` is decreased by (k - 1), `v` is a positive integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000), and `res` is increased by 1**
