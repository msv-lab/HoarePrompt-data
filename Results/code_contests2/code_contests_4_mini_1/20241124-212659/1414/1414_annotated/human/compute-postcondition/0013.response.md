Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ b ≤ 1000), and `v` is a positive integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000). If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is decreased by `k * v` and `b` is decreased by `k - 1`. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is 0, `a` is decreased by `v`. In all cases, `res` remains 1, and `a` must remain a positive integer, which implies that after the decrement, `a` should be greater than or equal to 1. Edge cases where the decrement results in `a` being less than 1 should be acknowledged, as this could lead to an invalid state.***
