The function `func` accepts four parameters: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`. 

- `k` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k \leq 1000 \).
- `a` is a positive integer representing the number of nuts, such that \( 1 \leq a \leq 1000 \).
- `b` is a non-negative integer representing the number of divisors, such that \( 0 \leq b \leq 1000 \).
- `v` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box, such that \( 1 \leq v \leq 1000 \).

The function's output will depend on the values of these parameters, and it will return a specific result based on the defined relationships among them. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters k, a, b, and v, where k is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), a is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), b is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ b ≤ 1000), and v is a positive integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000). The function returns a result based on the relationships among these parameters.**
