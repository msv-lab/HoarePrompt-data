The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)` from its previous value. Given that `b` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ b ≤ 1000), the new value of `b` will also remain non-negative unless `b` was less than `k - 1`. However, since we do not have the previous value of `b`, we cannot explicitly calculate the new value but only state the condition.

The other variables `k`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the output state is based on the updated value of `b`.

Output State: **`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` is increased by 1**
