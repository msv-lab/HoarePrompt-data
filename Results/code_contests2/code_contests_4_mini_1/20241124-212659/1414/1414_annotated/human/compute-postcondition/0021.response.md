Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is updated to be at least 1 after the execution of the program fragment. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is decreased by (b + 1) * v and `b` is set to 0. Otherwise, `a` is decreased by `v`, `b` remains a non-negative integer (0 ≤ b ≤ 1000), and `res` is increased by 1 in both cases.***
