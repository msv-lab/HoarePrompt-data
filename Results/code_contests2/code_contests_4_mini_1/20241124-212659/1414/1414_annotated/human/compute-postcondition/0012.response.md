Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is updated based on the value of `b`: if `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0; if `b` is 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`. In both cases, `b` is 0 after execution, `v` is a positive integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000), and `res` remains 1. Additionally, `a` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) after the decrement unless the decrement results in a value less than 1, which should be considered an edge case.***
