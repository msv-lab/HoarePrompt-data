Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is updated based on the value of `b`. If `b >= k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v` and `b` is decreased by `(k - 1)`, and `res` is increased by 1. If `0 < b < k`, then `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v`, `b` is set to 0, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`, `b` remains unchanged as a non-negative integer (0 ≤ b ≤ 1000), and `res` is still increased by 1. In all cases, `a` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 1 after the execution of the program fragment.***
