The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. The values of `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than 0, `b` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ b ≤ 1000), and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than 0, `b` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ b ≤ 1000), and `res` is increased by 1**
