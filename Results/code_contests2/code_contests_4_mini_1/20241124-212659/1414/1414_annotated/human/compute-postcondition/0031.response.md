Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than 0, and `b` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ b ≤ 1000). If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v` and `b` is decreased by `(k - 1)`. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`. In all cases, `res` is increased by 1.***
