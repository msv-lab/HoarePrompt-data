The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are assigned based on the input provided. The input consists of a single line containing four integers separated by spaces, which will be converted to integers and assigned to the variables accordingly. The previous values of the variables are overwritten by the input values. The output state will reflect the new values assigned to these variables.

Output State: **`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `v` is a positive integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000)**
