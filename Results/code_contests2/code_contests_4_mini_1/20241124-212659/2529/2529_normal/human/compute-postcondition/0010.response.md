The `test_list` is updated by appending the value of `e`, which is a float input. The previous value of `test_list` already contains the value of `e`, and now it will contain `e` again as an appended element. Therefore, the number of occurrences of `e` in `test_list` will increase by one. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is an input integer greater than 1 and within the range 1 to 200,000; `i` is 2; `test_list` contains the value of `e` twice; `e` is a float input.**
