According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. If `test_list` is empty, the loop will not execute. To ensure the loop can execute, `test_list` must contain at least one item. Since `my_list` is empty, it does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `test_list` must contain at least one element, and `i` should be assigned the first element of `test_list`.

State: **`test_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `my_list` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `test_list`**
