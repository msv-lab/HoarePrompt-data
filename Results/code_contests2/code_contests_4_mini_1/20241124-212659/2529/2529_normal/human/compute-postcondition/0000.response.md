The variable `m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that will be converted to an integer. The previous state of `m` is an integer within the range 1 to 200,000. Other variables and their states are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `m` now holds the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 200,000**
