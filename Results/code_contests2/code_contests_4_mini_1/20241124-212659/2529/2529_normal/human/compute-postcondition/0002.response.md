According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, it ensures that the loop can execute at least once. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment until it reaches `m - 1`. 

At the beginning of the loop, `i` should be set to 0, as that's the starting point of the loop iteration. The `test_list` being empty does not affect the loop's ability to execute, as the loop does not rely on the contents of `test_list`.

State: **`m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 200,000, `i` is 0, `test_list` is an empty list**
