The `append` method is called on `my_list`, which adds the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`. The value of `i` is the second element of `test_list`, and `my_list` is updated with this new count. Since `test_list` contains at least 2 elements, the state of `my_list` will be affected by adding this count.

The value of `my_list` will now include the count of `i` in `test_list` alongside its previous values. The specific count value is based on the occurrences of `i`.

Output State: **`test_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `my_list` now includes the count of `i` in `test_list`, `i` is the second element of `test_list`**
