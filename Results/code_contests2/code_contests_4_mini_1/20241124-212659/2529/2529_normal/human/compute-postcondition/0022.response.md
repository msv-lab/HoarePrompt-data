The code prints the elements of `my_list` joined by spaces. The value of `my_list` is determined by the counts of each element in `test_list`. If `test_list` is empty, then `my_list` is also empty, and consequently nothing will be printed. Therefore, the output state is: `my_list` is empty, and nothing is printed.

Output State: **`my_list` is empty, and nothing is printed**
