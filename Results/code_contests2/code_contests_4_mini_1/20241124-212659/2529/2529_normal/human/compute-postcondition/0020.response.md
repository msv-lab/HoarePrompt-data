According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `test_list`. If the list has at least 4 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `test_list` has at least 3 elements, and `i` is the third element of `test_list`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `test_list` must have at least 4 elements, and `i` should be the fourth element of `test_list`.

State: **`test_list` is a list with at least 4 elements, `my_list` includes the count of `i` in `test_list`, and `i` is the fourth element of `test_list`**
