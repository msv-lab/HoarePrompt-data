The code appends the count of `i` in `test_list` to `my_list`. The value of `i` is defined as the third element of `test_list`. Since `test_list` contains at least 3 elements, `i` will have a specific value. The count of `i` in `test_list` is determined by how many times that specific value appears within the list. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `test_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `my_list` now includes the count of `i` in `test_list`, and `i` is the third element of `test_list`.

Output State: **`test_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `my_list` now includes the count of `i` in `test_list`, and `i` is the third element of `test_list`**
