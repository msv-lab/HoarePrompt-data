The code snippet `test_list.append(e)` appends the value of `e` (which is a floating-point number based on the input) to the list `test_list`. The value of `m` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, and `i` is initialized to 1. The state of `m` and `i` are not changed by this operation, but the content of `test_list` is modified by adding `e` to it. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `test_list` now contains an additional element, `e`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 200,000, `i` is 1, `test_list` contains the value of `e` and now also contains the value of `e` as an appended element.**
