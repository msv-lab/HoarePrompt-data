The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it works with an integer `m` which must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000. Additionally, the function processes a list of jump coordinates where each coordinate is a string formatted as "(a+b)/c", with `a`, `b`, and `c` being positive integers that can have up to two decimal digits. 

Since the details of the output are not provided, we can only summarize the behavior based on the input constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle jump coordinates represented as strings and an integer `m` within specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000) and jump coordinates in the format "(a+b)/c" where a, b, and c are positive integers with up to two decimal digits.**
