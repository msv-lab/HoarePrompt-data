According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input integer `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is within the range of 1 to 200,000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `i` is now 2, and `m` remains within the range but should be greater than 1.

State: **`m` is an input integer greater than 1 and within the range 1 to 200,000, `i` is 2, `test_list` contains the value of `e` and now also contains the value of `e` as an appended element**
