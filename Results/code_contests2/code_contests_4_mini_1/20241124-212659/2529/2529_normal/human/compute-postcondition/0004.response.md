The value of `e` is appended to `test_list`. Since `test_list` is initially an empty list, after this operation, `test_list` will contain one element, which is the value of `e`. The values of the other variables (`m`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 200,000; `i` is 0; `test_list` contains the value of `e`; `e` is a floating-point number based on the input.
