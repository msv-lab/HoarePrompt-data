The function accepts an integer input `m` which specifies the number of floating-point numbers to be inputted by the user (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000). It collects these floating-point numbers into a list `test_list`. After that, it counts the occurrences of each unique floating-point number in `test_list` and stores these counts in another list `my_list`. Finally, it prints the counts as a space-separated string. If `m` is less than 1 or greater than 200,000, the function will not process any numbers, resulting in an empty output. Additionally, the function does not handle any input errors or exceptions, which may occur if the user inputs non-numeric values.
