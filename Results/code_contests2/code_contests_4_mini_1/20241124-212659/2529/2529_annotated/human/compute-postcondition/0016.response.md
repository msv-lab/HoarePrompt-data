According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element of `test_list`, and `test_list` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_list` must contain at least 2 elements, and `i` needs to be the second element in the list.

State: **`my_list` contains the count of `i` in `test_list`, `test_list` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `test_list`**
