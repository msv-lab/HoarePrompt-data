The code appends the count of `i` in `test_list` to `my_list`. The value of `i` is the third element of `test_list`, and since `test_list` has at least three elements, the count will be a valid integer. The previous state of `my_list` is unchanged prior to the append operation, and the count operation does not affect the original lists. Therefore, the output state will include the updated `my_list` and retain the previous values of `test_list` and `i`.

Output State: **`my_list` contains the count of `i` in `test_list`, `test_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `test_list`, and `my_list` has one more element added that is the count of `i` in `test_list`.**
