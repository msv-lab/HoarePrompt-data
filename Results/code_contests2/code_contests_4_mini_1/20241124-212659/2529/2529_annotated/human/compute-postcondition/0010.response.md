The value of `e` is appended to `test_list`, which modifies `test_list` to include the floating-point value of `e`. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `e` is a float, and `test_list` has `e` appended to it.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `e` is a float, and `test_list` has `e` appended to it.**
