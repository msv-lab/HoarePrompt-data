The code initializes `test_list` as an empty list. The value of `m` remains unchanged, as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000; `test_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000; `test_list` is an empty list**
