According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the input integer `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. Since `m` is still valid (it remains the same), there is no need to adjust `m`.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `i` should be updated to 1.

No changes are needed for `m` or `test_list` since they remain constant.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `e` is a float input, and `e` has been appended to `test_list`**
