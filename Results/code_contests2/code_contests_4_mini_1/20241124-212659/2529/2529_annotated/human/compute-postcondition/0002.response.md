According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is provided as an input integer and is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 and will increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `m-1`. 

Before the loop starts, `test_list` is empty, but this does not affect the execution of the loop itself, as the loop does not rely on `test_list` for its iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to indicate that `i` starts at 0 and that `m` is within the specified bounds.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0**
