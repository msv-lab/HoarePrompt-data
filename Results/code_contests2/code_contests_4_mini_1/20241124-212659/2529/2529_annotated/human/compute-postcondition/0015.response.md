The code appends the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list` to `my_list`. Given that `my_list` is initially empty and `i` is the first element of `test_list`, `test_list.count(i)` will return the number of times `i` appears in `test_list`. This means that after the execution, `my_list` will contain one element: the count of `i`.

The output state reflects that `my_list` now contains this count, while `test_list` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`my_list` contains the count of `i` in `test_list`, `test_list` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `test_list`**
