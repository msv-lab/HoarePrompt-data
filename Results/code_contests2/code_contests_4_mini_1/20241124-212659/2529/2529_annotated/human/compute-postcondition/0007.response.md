The `test_list` is appended with the value `e`. The value of `m` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The value of `i` also remains unchanged. Since `e` has been appended to `test_list`, the output state reflects the new state of `test_list` after the operation.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `e` is an input float, and `test_list` has `e` appended to it**
