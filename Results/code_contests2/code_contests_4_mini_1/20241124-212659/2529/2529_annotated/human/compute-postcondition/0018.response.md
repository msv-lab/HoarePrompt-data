According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `test_list`. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `test_list` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element of `test_list`, and `test_list` has at least 2 elements. 

To execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next element in `test_list`, which would be the third element. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `test_list` must have at least 3 elements. 

Therefore, the adjustments to the states should reflect that `i` is now the third element in `test_list`, and `test_list` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`my_list` contains the count of `i` in `test_list`, `test_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `test_list`**
