According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input integer `m`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `m` must also be at least 3 for the loop condition to be satisfied. Since `m` can be any integer within the specified range, it remains unchanged for the sake of this state adjustment.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `i` should be 3.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 3, `e` is a float, and `test_list` has `e` appended to it.**
