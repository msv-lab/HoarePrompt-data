The code appends the count of `i` in `test_list` to `my_list`. The initial state indicates that `my_list` already contains the count of `i` in `test_list`, and `i` is defined as the second element of `test_list`. Therefore, after executing the code, `my_list` will have one additional element which is the result of `test_list.count(i)`.

Since `i` is the second element of `test_list`, the count function will return the number of times this specific element appears in `test_list`. The original elements of `my_list` remain unchanged apart from the addition of this new count.

Output State: **`my_list` contains the count of `i` in `test_list`, `test_list` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `test_list`, and `my_list` now has an additional element which is the count of `i` in `test_list`.**
