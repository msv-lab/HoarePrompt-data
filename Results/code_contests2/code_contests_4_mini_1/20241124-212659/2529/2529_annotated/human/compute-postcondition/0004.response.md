The variable `test_list` is being appended with the value of `e`, which is a float input. The values of `m` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `m` and `i`, along with the addition of `e` to `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `e` is a float input, and `e` has been appended to `test_list`**
