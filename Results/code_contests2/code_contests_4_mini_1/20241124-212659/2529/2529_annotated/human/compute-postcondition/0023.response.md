The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as seen in the provided definition. However, it operates under the constraint that `m` is a positive integer with the condition 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000. Additionally, the function deals with jump coordinates, which are defined as arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers with up to two decimal digits.

The output of the function is not specified in detail in the provided information, but it implies that the function likely processes the jump coordinates based on the value of `m`. Given that no return values or specific cases have been defined, we cannot outline specific outputs. 

Functionality: **The function operates with the constraint that m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000) and processes jump coordinates expressed as (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers up to two decimal digits. The exact return value is not specified.**
