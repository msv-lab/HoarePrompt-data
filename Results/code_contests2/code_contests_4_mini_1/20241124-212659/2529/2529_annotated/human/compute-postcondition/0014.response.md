According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. If `test_list` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. Since `my_list` is an empty list, it does not affect the execution of the loop directly. However, for the loop to execute, `test_list` must have at least one element, and the loop variable `i` must be initialized to the first element of `test_list`. 

State: **`my_list` is an empty list, `test_list` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `test_list`**
