The variable `m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `m` is defined as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, the exact value of `m` will depend on the input provided. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects that `m` is now an input integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000**
