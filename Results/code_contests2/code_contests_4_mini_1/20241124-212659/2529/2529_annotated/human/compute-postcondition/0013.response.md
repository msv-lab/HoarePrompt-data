The variable `my_list` is initialized as an empty list. Since there is no loop or additional logic provided in the code snippet, the state of the other variables (`m`, `test_list`, and `i`) does not change based on the provided code. Therefore, we can conclude that `my_list` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`my_list` is an empty list**
