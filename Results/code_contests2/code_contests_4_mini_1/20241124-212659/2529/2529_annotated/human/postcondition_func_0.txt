The function accepts an integer input `m` that specifies the number of subsequent float inputs to be collected. It reads `m` float numbers from the user and stores them in a list called `test_list`. It then counts the frequency of each float in `test_list`, storing these counts in another list called `my_list`. Finally, it prints the frequencies of all elements in `my_list` as a space-separated string. If `m` is less than 1, the function does not execute the loop to collect inputs, resulting in an empty output. Additionally, the function does not handle any exceptions related to user input, such as non-integer or non-float values.
