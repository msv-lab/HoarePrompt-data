Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly parse and evaluate the arithmetic expressions in the format `(a+b)/c`. Instead, it reads the input as a float directly, which will lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the program attempts to treat the input as a float without processing the arithmetic expression.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
(1+1)/2
```
The program will expect to receive a float directly, while it should parse the expression and evaluate it to `1.0`. 

Additionally, the logic used to count occurrences relies on the `count()` method, which counts the instances of each float in the list. However, since the floats are not being computed from the expression but rather read directly, this will not yield the counts of ships that jump to the same coordinate correctly.

Therefore, the program will fail for any input where the arithmetic expression must be evaluated, leading to incorrect results. For example, with the input:
```
4
(99+98)/97
(26+4)/10
(12+33)/15
(5+1)/7
```
The expected output is `1 2 2 1`, but the program will not produce this output because it does not evaluate the expressions correctly.

Thus, the program is incorrect for the problem description.
