To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The input consists of `m` arithmetic expressions in the form `(a+b)/c`.
- We need to compute the resulting coordinate for each ship and determine how many ships end up at the same coordinate.

### Analyzing the Program:
- The program reads `m`, then reads `m` lines of input containing the expressions.
- It attempts to convert each expression to a float and appends it to `test_list`.
- It counts how many times each coordinate appears in `test_list` and stores that count in `my_list`.
- Finally, it prints the counts as space-separated integers.

### Problems with the Program:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program does not correctly parse the arithmetic expressions. It attempts to directly convert the input string to a float, which will fail because the input is in the form `(a+b)/c`, not a direct numeric value.
2. **Expression Evaluation**: Since the expressions are not evaluated, the program will not compute the coefficients as floating-point numbers. Instead, it needs to parse the string, evaluate the expression, and then store the result.
3. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: Even if the expressions were evaluated correctly, the counting part is handling the coordinates incorrectly since the counting should be based on evaluated results, not the string representation.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
2
(1+1)/2
(2+0)/2
```
Expected output:
```
2 2
```
But since the program does not parse or evaluate the expressions, it will likely throw an error or produce incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description correctly, as it fails to parse and evaluate the arithmetic expressions properly. Because of these issues, it cannot produce the correct output for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
