Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of lowercase letters, `l` is a list of substrings derived from `a`, `A` and `B` are valid substrings convertible to integers where `int(A) + 1` is less than `int(B)`, `i` is `int(A) + 1`, and `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `i`. If the first and fifth characters of `C` are equal and the second and fourth characters of `C` are equal, then `ans` is increased by 1. If these conditions are not met, `ans` remains unchanged.***
