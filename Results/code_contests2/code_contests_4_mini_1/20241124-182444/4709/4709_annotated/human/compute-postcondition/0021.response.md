To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute one more time, we begin by analyzing the loop's conditions and the existing state information.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(int(A), int(B))`. This indicates that the loop will iterate through values starting from `int(A)` up to, but not including, `int(B)`.

2. From the given information, we know that `i` is currently `int(A) + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `int(B)`.

3. Since it is stated that `int(A) + 1 < int(B)`, it follows that `int(A) + 2 < int(B)` must also hold true for the loop to continue executing.

4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be incremented, meaning we need to adjust `i` to `int(A) + 3`.

5. The range will then be from `int(A)` to `int(B)`, and since `i` will be `int(A) + 3`, we also need to ensure that `int(A) + 3` is still less than `int(B)` for the loop to continue. 

6. The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` do not need to be changed based on the provided conditions, but we will need to ensure the characters in `C` are still valid for the new value of `i`.

Putting all of this together, the necessary adjustments to the state are:

State: **`a` is a string of lowercase letters, `l` is a list of substrings derived from `a`, `A` and `B` are valid substrings convertible to integers where `int(A) + 1` is less than `int(B)`, `i` is `int(A) + 3`, and `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `int(A) + 3`.**
