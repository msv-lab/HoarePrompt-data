The variable `B` is assigned the value of the second element (index 1) of the list `l`. The state of the variable `a` remains unchanged as it is a string input, and the state of `l` is unaffected by the assignment to `B`. The first substring of `l`, denoted as `A`, is also unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to `B`.

Output State: **`a` is a string input representing a row of the 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of substrings derived from `a`; `A` is the first substring of `l`; `B` is the second substring of `l`**
