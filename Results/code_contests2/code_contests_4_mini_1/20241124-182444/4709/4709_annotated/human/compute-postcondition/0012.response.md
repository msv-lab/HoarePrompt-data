Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of lowercase letters, `l` is a list of substrings derived from `a`, `A` and `B` are valid substrings convertible to integers where `int(A)` is less than `int(B)`, `i` is set to `int(A)`, and `C` is a list of characters of the string representation of `int(A)`. If the first character of `C` is equal to the fifth character of `C` and the second character of `C` is equal to the fourth character of `C`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. Additionally, it's important to note that the length of `C` must be at least 5 for the comparisons to be valid, and if `C` has fewer than 5 characters, the condition cannot be satisfied.***
