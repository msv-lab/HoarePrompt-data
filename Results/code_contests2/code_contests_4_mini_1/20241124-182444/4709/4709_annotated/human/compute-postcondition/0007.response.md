Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a row of the 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of substrings derived from `a`; `A` is the first substring of `l`, and `B` is the second substring of `l`. If the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, then `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
