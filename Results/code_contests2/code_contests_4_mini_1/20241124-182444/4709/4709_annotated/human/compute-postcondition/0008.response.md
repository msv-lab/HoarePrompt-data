To determine the necessary state modifications for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables involved in the `for` loop statement.

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over the range defined by `int(A)` and `int(B)`. For the loop to execute, `int(A)` must be less than `int(B)`; otherwise, the range will be empty and the loop will not run.

2. **Variables to Consider**:
   - `A` and `B` are substrings derived from the string `a` and are assumed to represent numeric values.
   - The values of `int(A)` and `int(B)` need to be such that `int(A) < int(B)`.

3. **Initial State**: Before the loop starts, we know that:
   - `a` is a string representing a row of the grid.
   - `l` is a list of substrings derived from `a`.
   - `A` is the first substring and `B` is the second substring from `l`.
   - The variable `ans` is set based on the comparison of `int(A)` and `int(B)`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Ensure that `A` and `B` are both valid substrings that can be converted to integers.
   - Ensure that `int(A)` is less than `int(B)` for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the required adjustments would be:

State: **`a` is a string of lowercase letters, `l` is a list of substrings derived from `a`, `A` is a valid substring convertible to an integer, `B` is a valid substring convertible to an integer, `int(A)` is less than `int(B)`, `i` is set to `int(A)`**
