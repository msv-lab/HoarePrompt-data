Postcondition: ***`a` is a string containing three rows of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list of strings containing the rows, `A` is the first row of `l`, `B` is the second row of `l`, and `ans` is initialized to 0. If the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. This accounts for cases where `A` and `B` are equal or different, covering scenarios where both rows could represent different numerical values or the same value despite being composed of characters.***
