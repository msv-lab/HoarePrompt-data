Postcondition: ***`a` is a string containing three rows of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list of strings containing the rows, `A` is less than `B`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `A + 2`, and `C` is a list of characters derived from the string representation of `i`. If the first character of `C` equals the fifth character of `C`, and the second character of `C` equals the fourth character of `C`, then `ans` is incremented by 1, resulting in `ans` being either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
