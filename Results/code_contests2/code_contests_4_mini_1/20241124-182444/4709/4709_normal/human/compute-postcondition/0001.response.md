The variable `l` is assigned the value of `a.split()`, which splits the string `a` into a list of strings based on whitespace. Since `a` is a string containing three rows of three lowercase English letters, the output will be a list of those rows. The state of the variable `a` is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a string containing three rows of three lowercase English letters, and `l` is a list of strings created by splitting `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a string containing three rows of three lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of strings created by splitting `a`**
