The value of `ans` is assigned to 1, changing its previous value from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string containing three rows of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list of strings containing the rows, `A` is the first row of `l`, `B` is the second row of `l`, `ans` is 1, and the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`.
