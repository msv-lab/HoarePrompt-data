Postcondition: ***`a` is a string containing three rows of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list of strings containing the rows, `A` is less than `B`, `ans` is initialized to 0, `i` is an integer value representing `A`, and `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `i`. If the first character of `C` is equal to the fifth character of `C` and the second character of `C` is equal to the fourth character of `C`, then `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
