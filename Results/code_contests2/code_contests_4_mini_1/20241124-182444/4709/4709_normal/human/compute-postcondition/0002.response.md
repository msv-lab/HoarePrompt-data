The variable `A` is assigned the value of `l[0]`, which is the first element of the list `l`. Since `l` is created by splitting the string `a`, `l[0]` will be the first row of the three rows of lowercase English letters contained in `a`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a string containing three rows of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list of strings containing the rows, and `A` is the first row of `l`.

Output State: **`a` is a string containing three rows of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list of strings containing the rows, `A` is the first row of `l`**
