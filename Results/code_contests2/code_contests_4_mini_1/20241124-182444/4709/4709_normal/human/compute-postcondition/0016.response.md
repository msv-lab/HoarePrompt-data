Postcondition: ***`a` is a string containing three rows of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list of strings containing the rows, `A` is less than `B`, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the characters at positions 0 and 4 of `C` are equal and the characters at positions 1 and 3 of `C` are equal. Specifically, if the conditions `C[0] == C[4]` and `C[1] == C[3]` hold true, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If these conditions do not hold, `ans` remains unchanged at 0. The variable `i` remains equal to `A + 1`, and `C` is a list of characters derived from the string representation of `i`.***
