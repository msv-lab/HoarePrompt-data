The function `func` does not accept any parameters and relies on user input. It reads a string of space-separated values, splits the string into a list, and assigns the first two elements to variables `A` and `B`. It initializes a counter `ans` to zero. If the integer values of `A` and `B` are equal, it increments `ans` to 1. Otherwise, it iterates over the range from the integer value of `A` to the integer value of `B`, converting each number in that range into a list of its digits. If the first and fifth digits are the same, and the second and fourth digits are the same, it increments `ans`. At the end of the execution, it prints the value of `ans`.

The function does not have any return statements and only prints the result. It does not handle cases where the input might not contain exactly two values or if the provided strings cannot be converted to integers. Additionally, if `A` is greater than or equal to `B`, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 0.

Functionality: ** The function reads a string input, splits it into two parts as integers `A` and `B`, checks if they are equal, counts the numbers in the range from `A` to `B-1` that have specific digit conditions, and prints the count. It does not handle invalid input cases, such as non-integers or insufficient input values. **
