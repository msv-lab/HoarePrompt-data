The function accepts two integers, `n` and `t`, and a list of `n` non-negative integers, each representing a time value. It calculates how many values from the list can be cumulatively subtracted from `t` (specifically `86400 - a[i]` for each value) until `t` is less than or equal to zero or until the end of the list is reached. It prints the count of how many values were processed before stopping. If `t` is initially less than or equal to zero, no values are processed, and the function will print `0`. There is a potential risk of an index error if the number of values processed exceeds `n`, but this is not handled in the code.
