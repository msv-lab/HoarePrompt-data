The line of code `n, t = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` is executed. This means that `n` and `t` will be assigned the values obtained from the input provided by `raw_input()`, which is split into separate components and converted to integers. The impact of this code on the program is that the previous values of `n` and `t` are replaced with the new integer values provided by the user input. The list `a` remains unchanged since it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (new input), `t` is a positive integer (new input), `a` is a list of n integers where each ai is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400**
