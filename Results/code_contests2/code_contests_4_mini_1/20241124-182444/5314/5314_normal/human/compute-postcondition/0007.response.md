The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The state of `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[i])) and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[i])), and `i` is increased by 1**
