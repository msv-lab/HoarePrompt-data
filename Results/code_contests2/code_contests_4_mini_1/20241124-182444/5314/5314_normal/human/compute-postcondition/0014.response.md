The function `func` does not explicitly take parameters since the parameter list is empty. However, it operates on three constraints: `n`, `t`, and `a`. 

- `n` is a positive integer with a constraint of \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `t` is a positive integer with a constraint of \(1 \leq t \leq 10^6\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) is a non-negative integer constrained by \(0 \leq a_i \leq 86400\).

The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific return value based solely on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates on a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), and a list a of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400), but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
