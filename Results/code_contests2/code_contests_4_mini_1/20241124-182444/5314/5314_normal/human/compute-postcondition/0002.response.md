The variable `i` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables `n`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged as the code only affects `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, and `i` is 0**
