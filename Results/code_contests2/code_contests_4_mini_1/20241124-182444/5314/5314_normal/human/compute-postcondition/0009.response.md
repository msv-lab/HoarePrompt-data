The value of `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`. Since `t` is greater than `86400 - int(a[i])`, this operation will result in a positive value for `t`. The specific new value of `t` is not calculable without knowing the exact value of `int(a[i])`, but it is affected by this operation. The value of `i` has already been increased by 1, so its new value is known, but `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is updated to a value less than its previous value, `i` is the incremented value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is updated to a value less than its previous value, `i` is incremented by 1**
