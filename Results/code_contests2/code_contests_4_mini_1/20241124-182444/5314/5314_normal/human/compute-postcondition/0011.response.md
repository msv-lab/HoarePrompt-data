According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has been updated to a value less than its previous value, but we don't know the exact current value of `t`. Since `n` is a positive integer and does not affect the loop condition, it doesn't need to be adjusted. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the value of `t` to be greater than 0. This means that `t` should be updated to a value that is still positive. Therefore, we can say that `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is updated to a value greater than 0, and `i` is increased by 1**
