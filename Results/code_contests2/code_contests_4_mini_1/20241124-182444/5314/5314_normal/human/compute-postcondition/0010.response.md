The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The values of `n` and `t` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is updated to a value less than its previous value, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is updated to a value less than its previous value, and `i` is increased by 1**
