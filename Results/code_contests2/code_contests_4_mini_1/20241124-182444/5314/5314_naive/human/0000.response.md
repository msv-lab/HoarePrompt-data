To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic behind it.

The problem states that Luba has `n` days and will take `t` seconds to read a book. For each day `i`, Luba has `a[i]` seconds of work, leaving her with `86400 - a[i]` seconds for reading. We need to find out the minimum day when she finishes reading the book.

Now, looking at the program:

```python
(n, t) = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
a = raw_input().split()
i = 0
while t > 0:
    t -= 86400 - int(a[i])
    i += 1
print(i)
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. It reads `n` and `t` correctly.
2. It reads the work times `a` but does not convert them to integers, which will lead to a TypeError when trying to subtract from `t` since `a[i]` will be a string.
3. The loop continues until `t` is less than or equal to zero, which is appropriate to track the time spent reading.
4. The variable `i` is incremented correctly to count the days.

### Potential Issues:
- Since `a` is not converted to integers, the operation `86400 - int(a[i])` will raise an exception.
- If `t` is already 0 or less, the loop will not execute, and `i` will equal 0, which may not correctly represent the day she finishes if she finishes on the first day.

### Example of Failure:
If `n = 2`, `t = 2`, and the input for `a` is `86400 86398`, the loop will not run correctly due to the string handling, and it will not compute the correct day count.

Given these observations, the program has a critical flaw that prevents it from functioning correctly under all circumstances.

Correctness: **False**.
