The function accepts two integers `n` and `t`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It iteratively decreases `t` by the difference between 86400 and each element in `a` until either `t` becomes non-positive or all elements in `a` have been processed. The function then prints the number of iterations performed, which corresponds to how many times `t` was decremented. If `t` is initially less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `i` will remain 0.
