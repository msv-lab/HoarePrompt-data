Output State: **`if t is greater than 0 and i is less than n then t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])` for each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. If `t` becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop stops and `i` will equal the number of iterations performed. If `i` reaches `n` before `t` is non-positive, then the loop will stop regardless of the value of `t`. If `t` is initially less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and remains unchanged.**
