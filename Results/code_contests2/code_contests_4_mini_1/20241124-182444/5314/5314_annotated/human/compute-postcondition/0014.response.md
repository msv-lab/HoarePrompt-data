The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `a`. 

- `n` is an integer that must be between 1 and 100.
- `t` is an integer that must be between 1 and 1,000,000.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `ai` in the list is between 0 and 86400.

The function's output is determined based on the values of these parameters, but specific return values or conditions are not provided in the prompt.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (between 1 and 100), an integer `t` (between 1 and 1,000,000), and a list `a` of `n` integers (each between 0 and 86400).**
