The code assigns values to `n` and `t` by taking input from the user and converting it to integers. The input is expected to be a space-separated string of two integers. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000, the new values of `n` and `t` will be defined by the user's input. The list `a` remains unaffected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai is between 0 and 86400**
