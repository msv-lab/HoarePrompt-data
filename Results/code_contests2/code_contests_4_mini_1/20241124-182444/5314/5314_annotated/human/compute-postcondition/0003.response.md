The value of `a[i]` is an integer between 0 and 86400, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000. The expression calculates the new value of `t` by subtracting `86400 - int(a[i])` from its current value. 

Thus, the new value of `t` will be:
`t = t - (86400 - int(a[i]))`
which simplifies to:
`t = t - 86400 + int(a[i])`

The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is updated, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai is between 0 and 86400, `i` is 0**
