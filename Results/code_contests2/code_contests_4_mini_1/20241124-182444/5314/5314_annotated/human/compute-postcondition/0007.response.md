The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown (given as 1 in the initial state). After execution, `i` will be 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, and `a`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is updated, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` is between 0 and 86400, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is updated, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` is between 0 and 86400, `i` is 2**
