The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. After execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, and `a`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is updated, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai is between 0 and 86400, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is updated, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai is between 0 and 86400, and `i` is 1**
