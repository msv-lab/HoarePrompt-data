The function reads two integers `H` and `N` from input, followed by `N` integers. It calculates the sum `s` of these integers and prints 'Yes' if `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, or 'No' if `s` is less than `H`. The function does not accept any parameters and relies on user input for its operation.
