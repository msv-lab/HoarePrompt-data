The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, calculates their sum, and returns the result of (a + b) mod `mod`, ensuring the result is non-negative. If the sum is greater than or equal to `mod`, it reduces the result by `mod` to maintain it within bounds. However, the value of `mod` is not defined within the function, which could lead to a NameError if not defined elsewhere in the code.
