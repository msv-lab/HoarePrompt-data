The first line of the code reads input and assigns the values to `H` and `N`. The variables `H` and `N` are initialized based on the input values, which are integers. The initial state indicates that `N` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200000, and `H` is presumably defined as a list or a single integer representing a height.

Since the specific values of `H` and `N` were not provided in the initial state, we denote them as being assigned from the input.

Output State: **`H` is assigned a value from input, `N` is assigned a value from input**
