Postcondition: ***`H` is a value from input, `N` is a value from input, and `s` is the sum of integers from the input list. If `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed, indicating that `s` is less than `H`. This covers all cases, including when `s` equals `H` and when `s` is less than `H`.***
