Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. 

1. **Function Analysis**: 
   - The first function `func_1` is designed to calculate `(a + b) % mod`, but `mod` is not defined anywhere in the provided code, which leads to a logical flaw. Moreover, this function has no relevance to the problem statement about Fennec fighting monsters.
   - The second function `func_2` checks if the sum of the health of the monsters is greater than or equal to a value `H`, which is also not defined in the context of the problem statement. This function does not calculate the minimum number of attacks needed by Fennec, nor does it account for the maximum number of special moves allowed (`K`).

2. **Missing Logic**: 
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum number of attack actions needed after using special moves optimally. Neither function addresses this requirement.

3. **Example of Failure**:
   - For an input like `3 1` and health values `4 1 5`, the expected output is `5`. The provided code does not compute this correctly and instead outputs either 'Yes' or 'No' based on a sum comparison that is irrelevant to the problem at hand.

In summary, the functions do not perform the necessary operations to solve the problem as described, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
