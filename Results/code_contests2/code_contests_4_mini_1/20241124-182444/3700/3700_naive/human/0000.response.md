Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not fulfill the problem's requirements. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of attacks Fennec needs to make to defeat all monsters while considering the ability to perform special moves. However, the program instead checks if the total health of all monsters is at least as much as a given value H and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on that. 

For instance, consider the input:
```
3 1
4 1 5
```
According to the problem description, Fennec needs to perform a minimum number of attacks considering that she can use special moves (in this case, 1 special move). The expected output is `5`, as Fennec can use the special move on the monster with health `5`, leaving her to attack the monsters with health `4` and `1`, which requires `4 + 1 = 5` attacks.

In contrast, the program's logic does not account for the number of attacks needed or the use of special moves. Instead, it merely checks if the sum of healths is greater than or equal to H, which is not related to the original problem. Thus, it is incorrect.
