The function accepts two integer parameters `a` (a positive integer) and `b` (a non-negative integer). It calculates the sum of `a` and `b`, and if the sum is greater than or equal to a predefined constant `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from the sum. The function then returns the resulting value, which will always be non-negative due to the subtraction condition.
