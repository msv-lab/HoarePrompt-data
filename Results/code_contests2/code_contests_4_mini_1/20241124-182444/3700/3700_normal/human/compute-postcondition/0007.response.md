The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It has certain constraints for its internal logic: `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 200000\), `K` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq K \leq 200000\), and `H_i` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq H_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in the range from \(0\) to \(N-1\). 

The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot state the exact return value without additional context. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its output is determined by the internal logic based on the constraints for N, K, and H_i.**
