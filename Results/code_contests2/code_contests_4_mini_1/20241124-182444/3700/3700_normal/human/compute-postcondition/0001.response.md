The variable `s` is assigned the value of the sum of a list comprehension that converts input from `raw_input()` into integers. The input is split into separate values, and each of those values is converted to an integer before the sum is calculated. The specific values of `H` and `N` do not affect this operation. Therefore, the output state is dependent on the input from `raw_input()`.

Output State: **`H` is assigned input integer, `N` is assigned input integer, and `s` is the sum of integers from the input.**
