The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'Yes'. The values of the variables `H`, `N`, and `s` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the string that was printed.

Output State: **`H` is an input integer, `N` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of integers from the input, and the sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, and 'Yes' is printed**.
