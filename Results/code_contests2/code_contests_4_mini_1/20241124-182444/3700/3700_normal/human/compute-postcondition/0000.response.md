The code snippet assigns values to variables `H` and `N` by reading a line of input, splitting it by spaces, and converting the resulting strings to integers. The input is expected to contain two integers.

Given the initial state, the values of `H` and `N` are determined by the input. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `N` now holds one of the integers read from input, and `H` is assigned the value of the other integer.

Output State: **`H` is assigned input integer, `N` is assigned input integer**
