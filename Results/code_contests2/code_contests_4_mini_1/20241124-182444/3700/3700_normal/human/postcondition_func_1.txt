The function accepts two integer inputs, `H` and `N`, where `H` is a threshold and `N` is the number of subsequent integers to be summed. It then reads `N` integers from input, calculates their sum `s`, and prints 'Yes' if `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, or 'No' if `s` is less than `H`. The function does not handle cases where `N` is zero or negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
