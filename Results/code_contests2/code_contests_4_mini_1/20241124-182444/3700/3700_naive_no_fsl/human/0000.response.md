Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description correctly. 

Here are the issues identified:

1. The function `func_2` calculates the sum of the health values of the monsters but does not implement any logic related to the allowed number of special moves (K). It only checks if the total health is greater than or equal to a variable `H`, which is incorrectly derived from the first line of input. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of attacks needed after utilizing special moves optimally.

2. The logic to minimize the number of attacks required is missing entirely. The program outputs "Yes" or "No" based on whether the total health meets a certain threshold, which is irrelevant to the requirement of calculating the minimum attacks before winning.

3. Additionally, the program does not handle the special move usage. There is no logic to determine how many monsters can be defeated with special moves and how many attacks would be needed after that, which is the core of the problem.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 1
4 1 5
```
The expected output, as per the problem description, should be `5` (1 special move on monster with health 5, and then 4 attacks on monster with health 4). However, the program will not even compute this and will produce incorrect output or fail. 

Thus, the program is incorrect for the described task.
