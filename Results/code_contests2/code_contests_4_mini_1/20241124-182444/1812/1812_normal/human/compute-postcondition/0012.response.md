Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input consisting of a positive integer followed by a single character ('a' to 'f'). It extracts the integer and the character, performs some calculations based on these values, and then prints a calculated output based on the modified integer and the position of the character in the alphabet. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
