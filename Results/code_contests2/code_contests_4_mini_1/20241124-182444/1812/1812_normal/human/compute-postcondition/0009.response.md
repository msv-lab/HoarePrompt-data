Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18), `s` is a character ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'), `S` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `N` is the integer value of `S` without the last character and is now updated based on the value of `M`. If `M` is either 1 or 2, then `N` is decreased by `M`, `M` is toggled (XORed with 3), and subsequently, `N` is increased by the new value of `M`. If `M` is not in (1, 2), no changes are made to `N` or `M`.***
