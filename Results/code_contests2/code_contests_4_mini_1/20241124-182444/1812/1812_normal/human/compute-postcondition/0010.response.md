To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet:

```
print((N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C))
```

Assuming `N` and `C` are positive integers and `C` is defined by the character `s` (where 'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, 'c' = 3, 'd' = 4, 'e' = 5, 'f' = 6), we need to take the following steps:

1. Calculate `(N - 1) // 2 * 7`: This will give us the contribution from the first division and multiplication.
2. Calculate `(N - 1) // 4 * 2`: This will give us the contribution from the second division and multiplication.
3. Calculate `(6 - C)`: This evaluates the value based on the character `s`.

After performing these calculations, we sum the results from steps 1, 2, and 3 to get the final value that will be printed.

However, without the specific values of `N`, `C`, and `s`, we cannot compute a numerical result. Therefore, we will mention that the output is based on these variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer updated based on `M`, `C` is defined by the character `s`, and the output is calculated as `((N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C))`**.
