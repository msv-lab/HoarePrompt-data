Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `s` is a character ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'), `N` is the integer value of the string `S` without its last character, `C` is the index of the last character of `S` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 5 for 'f'), and `M` is either 1 or 2. If `M` is 1, then `N` is decreased by 1 and increased by 2, resulting in `N` being increased by 1. If `M` is 2, then `N` is decreased by 2 and increased by 1, resulting in `N` being decreased by 1. In summary, if `M` is in (1, 2), then `N` is updated based on the value of `M`. If `M` is 1, then `N` is incremented by 1; if `M` is 2, then `N` is decremented by 1.
