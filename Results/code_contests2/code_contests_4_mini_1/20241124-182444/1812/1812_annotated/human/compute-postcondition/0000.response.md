The code defines a lambda function `gets` that reads a line from standard input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip()`, and does not alter the values of `n` or `s`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `n` and `s` as they were in the initial state, while also mentioning the new function.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `s` is a character ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'), and `gets` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips whitespace.**
