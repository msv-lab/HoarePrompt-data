Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly determines the smallest index `k` where Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first `k` doors. The logic implemented in the program is flawed as it only checks for the first occurrence of a door being opened from each exit (left and right) based on a comparison of adjacent doors. 

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
0 1 0 1 0
```
In this case, the correct output should be `2`, as after opening the first two doors (the first being left and the second being right), Mr. Black can exit. However, the program would incorrectly return `1` because it only checks if adjacent doors are of different types and breaks out of the loop, failing to account for the situation where both exits have at least one door opened.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to an incorrect conclusion.
