The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, the value of `ans` becomes `(n - 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements, `ans` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, and the elements `c[i]` and `c[i + 1]` are not equal.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements, `ans` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, and the elements `c[i]` and `c[i + 1]` are not equal**.
