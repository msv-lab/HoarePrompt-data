According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to the range defined by `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to `n - 2` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, and the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to `2`, `i` must be adjusted to `n - 3` for the loop to execute one more time. 

Also, `c` should still contain `n` elements, and we need to ensure that the value of `ans` remains valid. Since the last iteration involved checking if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]`, and the loop will now be checking `c[i - 1]` and `c[i]`, we need to adjust `ans` accordingly based on the new value of `i`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `i` should be decremented to `n - 3`.
- `ans` should be set to `i + 1` (which will be `n - 2`), reflecting the new index it will check.

Therefore, we can summarize the adjustments as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements, `ans` is set to `n - 2`, and `i` is `n - 3`**.
