According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to the range defined by `n`. The `for` loop initializes `i` to `n - 2` and decrements it until it reaches `-1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `n - 4` on the next iteration. This is valid because `n - 4` is still within the range of `n - 2` to `-1`.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `n - 4` will still be a valid index and will not cause any issues with the loop's range. No additional states need to be adjusted apart from updating `i`.

Therefore, we adjust `i` to be `n - 4` for the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements, `ans` is set to `n - 2`, and `i` is `n - 4`**
