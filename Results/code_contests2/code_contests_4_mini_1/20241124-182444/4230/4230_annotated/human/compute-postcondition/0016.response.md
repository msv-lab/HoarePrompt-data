Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements, `ans` is set to `n - 2`, and `i` is `n - 4`. If the integers at index `i` and `i + 1` in the list `c` are not equal, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1`, and the program exits the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]`, `ans` remains `n - 2`, and the program continues without breaking out.***
