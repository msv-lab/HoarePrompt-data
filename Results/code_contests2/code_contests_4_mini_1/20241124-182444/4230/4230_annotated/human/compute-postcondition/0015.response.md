The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements, `ans` is `n - 3`, `i` is `n - 4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
