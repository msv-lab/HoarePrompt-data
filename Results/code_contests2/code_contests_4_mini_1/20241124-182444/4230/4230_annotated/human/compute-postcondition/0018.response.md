Output State: **If `n` is at least 2 and there exists at least one index `i` such that `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` will be set to the index `i + 1` where this condition is first met while iterating from `n - 2` to `0`. If all elements are equal, `ans` will remain `0`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains `0`.**
