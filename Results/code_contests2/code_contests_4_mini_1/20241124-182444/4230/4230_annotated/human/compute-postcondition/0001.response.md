The value of `n` is assigned the first element of the list `n`, which is derived from `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, after this assignment, `n` will hold the value of the first element of the list, which is also within the specified range. The list `c` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `n` is the first element of the input, and `c` is a list of integers with `n` elements.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the input, `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements**
