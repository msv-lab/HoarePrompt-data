The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The initial value of `i` is `n - 3`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `(n - 3) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`. Since `ans` was initially set to `n - 2`, it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements, `ans` is `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 3`**
