Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements, `ans` is set to `n - 2`, and `i` is `n - 3`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` before breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]`, the values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged, and the program continues execution beyond this block.***
