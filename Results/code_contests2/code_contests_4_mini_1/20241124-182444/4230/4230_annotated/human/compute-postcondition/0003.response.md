The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `c` remain unchanged, as no operations have been performed on them. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the first element of the input, `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements, and `ans` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the input, `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements, and `ans` is initialized to 0**
