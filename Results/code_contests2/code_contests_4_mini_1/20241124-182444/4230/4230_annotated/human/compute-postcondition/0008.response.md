Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements, and `ans` is set to `i + 1` (where `i` is `n - 2`) if the elements `c[i]` and `c[i + 1]` are not equal. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]`, the value of `ans` remains 0, since the condition to update it is not satisfied.***
