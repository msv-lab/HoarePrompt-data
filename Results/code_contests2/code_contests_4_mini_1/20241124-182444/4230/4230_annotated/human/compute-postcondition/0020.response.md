The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `c`. `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 200,000 \), and `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements, where each element is either 0 or 1. After executing the function body, the output will depend on the contents of the list `c` and its relationship to the integer `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `c` of `n` integers (which can only be 0 or 1), and it processes these inputs to produce a relevant output based on the specified criteria. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a list `c` of length `n` containing only integers 0 or 1.**
