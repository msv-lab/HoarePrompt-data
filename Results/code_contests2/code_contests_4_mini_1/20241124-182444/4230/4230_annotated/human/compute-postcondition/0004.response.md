According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop runs from `n - 2` down to `0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to `2`. Before the loop starts, `ans` is initialized to `0`, and the variable `i` will start at `n - 2`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `2` and that `i` is initialized to `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 2**
