The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 4`, we can substitute this into the equation:

`ans = (n - 4) + 1`

This simplifies to:

`ans = n - 3`

The other variables `n` and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers containing exactly `n` elements, `ans` is `n - 3`, and `i` is `n - 4**
