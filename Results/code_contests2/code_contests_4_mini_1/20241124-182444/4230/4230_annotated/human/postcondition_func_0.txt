The function accepts an integer `n` (the first input) and a list `c` of length `n` (the second input) containing integers. It iterates through the list from the second-to-last element to the first, checking for the first index where the current element is not equal to the next element. If such an index is found, it sets `ans` to that index plus one and prints it. If all elements in the list are equal or if `n` is less than 2, it prints `0`. The function does not handle cases where the inputs are invalid or where `n` is less than 2, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
