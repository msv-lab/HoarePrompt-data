Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is set to `n - 2` if `c[n - 3]` is not equal to `c[n - 2]`, and `i` is `n - 3`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]`, the value of `ans` remains as `n - 2` and no changes are made. In all cases, `i` remains as `n - 3`.***
