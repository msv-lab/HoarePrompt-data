The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 2` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` will be at least 0. Therefore, `ans` will be at least 1. Other variables `n`, `c`, and `i` remain unaffected by this assignment. The output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and the elements `c[i]` and `c[i + 1]` are not equal.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and the elements `c[i]` and `c[i + 1]` are not equal**
