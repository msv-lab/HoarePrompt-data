According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`, and since `n` is greater than or equal to `2`, `n - 3` is at least `-1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `n - 4`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `i` to `n - 4`. 

No other states need to be adjusted because `n` is still valid (greater than or equal to `2`), and there's no indication that `c` or `ans` affects the loop execution directly.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is set to `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 4`**
