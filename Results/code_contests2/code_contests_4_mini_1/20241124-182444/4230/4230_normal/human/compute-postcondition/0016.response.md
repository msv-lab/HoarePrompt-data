Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is initially set to `n - 2`, and `i` is set to `n - 4`. If the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` in the list `c` are not equal, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged at `n - 2`. Edge cases include scenarios where `i` equals the length of `c` minus 1, which may lead to an index error if `c` does not have enough elements to access `c[i + 1]`.
