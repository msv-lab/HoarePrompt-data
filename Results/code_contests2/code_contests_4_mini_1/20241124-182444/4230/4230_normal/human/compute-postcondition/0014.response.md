The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 4`, we can substitute that into the expression. Therefore, `ans` becomes `(n - 4) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 3`. The initial state of `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and the states of the other variables (`c`, `ans` before this operation, and `i`) are not directly affected. 

So, after executing the code, `ans` has the new value of `n - 3`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2; `c` is a list of integers; `ans` is `n - 3`; `i` is `n - 4`**
