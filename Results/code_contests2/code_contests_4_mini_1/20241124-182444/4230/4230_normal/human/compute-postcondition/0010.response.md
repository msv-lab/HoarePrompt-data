The variable `ans` is reassigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is previously set to `n - 3`, the new value for `ans` will be `n - 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`. The initial state specifies that `ans` was already set to `n - 2` if `c[n - 3]` is not equal to `c[n - 2]`. However, since the new assignment will overwrite `ans`, the value of `ans` remains `n - 2`. The other variables (`n`, `c`, `i`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 3`**
