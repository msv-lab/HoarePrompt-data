Output State: **If `n` is at least 2, and `c` is a list of integers, then after the loop executes, `ans` will be the index of the last element in `c` that is different from its next element. If all adjacent elements are equal, `ans` remains 0. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 0. Additionally, if `c` has fewer than `n` elements, it may lead to an index error when trying to access `c[i + 1]`.**
