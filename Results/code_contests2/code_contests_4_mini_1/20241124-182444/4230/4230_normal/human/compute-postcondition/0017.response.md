According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 2` down to `0`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is set to `n - 4`, which means it must be adjusted to `n - 5` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` will be `n - 4` which means `n` must be at least 4 for `i` to be non-negative. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` would need to be adjusted to `n - 5`, and `n` must be at least 5 to ensure that `i` remains non-negative.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is initially set to `n - 2`, and `i` is set to `n - 5`**
