The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the first element of the input list, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the input list, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `ans` is 0**
