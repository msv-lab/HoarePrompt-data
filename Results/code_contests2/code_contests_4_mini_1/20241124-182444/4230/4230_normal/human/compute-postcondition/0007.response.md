The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal block of code we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
