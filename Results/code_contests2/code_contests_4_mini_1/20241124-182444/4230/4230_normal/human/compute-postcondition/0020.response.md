The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `c`. The parameter `n` is an integer that satisfies the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The parameter `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer is either 0 (representing a left exit) or 1 (representing a right exit). The function returns a value based on the content of the list `c`. 

While the specific output conditions based on the list `c` are not provided, the function will determine its return value based on the arrangement of exits (0s and 1s) in the list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `c`, and return a result that reflects the configuration of exits represented by the integers in `c`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a list c of length n containing integers that are either 0 or 1, and returns a result based on the configuration of exits represented in the list.**
