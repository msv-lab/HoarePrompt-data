Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `c` of length `n` containing integers (expected to be either 0 or 1). It finds and prints the index of the last element in `c` that is different from its next element. If all adjacent elements are equal or if `n` is less than 2, the function will print 0. However, if `c` has fewer than `n` elements, it may lead to an index error. **
