Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, and `ans` is set to `i + 1` where `i` is `n - 2` if the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in the list `c` are not equal. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]`, the value of `ans` remains 0, and no updates are made to `ans`.***
