To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the implementation.

The problem states that Mr. Black opens doors sequentially, and we need to find the smallest index \( k \) such that all doors in at least one exit (left or right) are open after opening the first \( k \) doors.

### Key Observations:
1. The input consists of a sequence where `0` represents a door in the left exit and `1` represents a door in the right exit.
2. The program attempts to find the index \( k \) where the sequence of opened doors changes from one exit to another, which is not a correct approach to solve the problem.

### Issues with the Program:
1. The loop iterates backward from the second last element to zero, checking if the current door is different from the next. This does not guarantee that all doors in either exit have been opened up to that point. It simply checks for a change in exit type between two consecutive doors, which does not relate to whether all doors for one exit are open.
   
2. The condition to break the loop (`if c[i] != c[i + 1]`) does not consider whether all doors of either the left exit (`0`) or the right exit (`1`) were opened. The logic needed is to count the number of opened doors of each type and determine if either count reaches the total number of doors for that exit.

### Example of Failure:
For the input:
```
5
0 0 1 0 0
```
The expected output is `3`, because after opening the first three doors, both doors in the right exit are open. However, the current implementation would not correctly determine this \( k \) value, since it only looks for a switch between door types.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not meet the criteria specified in the problem description and fails to correctly identify the smallest \( k \) where Mr. Black can exit the house, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
