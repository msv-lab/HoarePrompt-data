The function reads an integer `T` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads 9 lines of input, where each line represents a row of digits. The function transforms each row by replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1' and appends the transformed rows to a result list. Finally, it outputs all the transformed rows, joined by newline characters. If `T` is 0, no rows are processed, and no output is generated.
