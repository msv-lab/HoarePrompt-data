According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row` variable. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a character that represents a digit, which can be '9' or any other digit. 

To determine the updated states needed for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider that `i` is currently at the last character of the string `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to point to the next character in `row`. Since `row` is a new non-empty string, we can deduce that `i` must represent the next character in the string.

If the previous character was the last character in `row`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `i` must be updated to the next character in `row`. 

Thus, considering the string `row` has characters, the next state should reflect that `nRow` and `res` remain unchanged, and we must ensure that `i` is updated to the next character in `row`.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` retains its previous value, `res` retains its previous value, `i` is the next character in the string `row`**
