Postcondition: ***`nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1' if `i` is '9'; otherwise, `nRow` is concatenated with the string representation of `i`. The variable `res` retains the value of the updated `nRow`, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `row` remains a non-empty string with at least one character remaining.***
