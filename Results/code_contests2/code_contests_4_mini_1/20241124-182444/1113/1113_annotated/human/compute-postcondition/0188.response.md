The value of `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it. Since `nRow` is a string, the previous value of `nRow` will have '1' added to its end. The values of `res` and `row` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is the original string with '1' appended to it, `res` contains the updated value of `nRow`, and `row` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is the original string with '1' appended to it, `res` contains the updated value of `nRow`, and `row` is unchanged**
