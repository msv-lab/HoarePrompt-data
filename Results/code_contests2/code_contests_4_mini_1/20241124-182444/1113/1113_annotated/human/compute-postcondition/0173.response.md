The code appends `nRow` to the list `res`. The value of `nRow` is a string where every occurrence of '9' in `row` is replaced by '1', and all other characters are retained in their original order. If `row` is an empty string, `nRow` remains empty, while `res` retains its previous value. Therefore, the output state reflects the state of `nRow` and `res` after the append operation.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string where every '9' in `row` is replaced by '1', and `res` has `nRow` appended to it**
