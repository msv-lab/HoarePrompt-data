Output State: **After executing the loop 9 times, `res` will contain 9 strings, each with every occurrence of '9' in the corresponding input `row` replaced with '1'. If any of the input rows are empty, the corresponding `nRow` will also be an empty string, and `res` will include this empty string. If the loop does not execute (for example, if `t` is not greater than or equal to 9), `res` will remain unchanged and still contain the original 9 strings.**
