The value of `row` is updated by taking input and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. This means that `row` will now hold a new non-empty string value based on user input. The variables `nRow` and `res` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them, and the value of `i` is still 9. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a new non-empty string from input, `nRow` is the transformed version of the previous `row`, `res` includes `nRow`, and `i` is 9.

Output State: **`row` is a new non-empty string from input, `nRow` is the transformed version of the previous `row`, `res` includes `nRow`, and `i` is 9**
