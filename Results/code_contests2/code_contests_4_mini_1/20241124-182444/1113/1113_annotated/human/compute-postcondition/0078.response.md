The variable `nRow` is updated by concatenating the current value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is 0, after execution, `nRow` will become '0'. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 10, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is '0'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 10, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is '0'**
