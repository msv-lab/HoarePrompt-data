The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`, which means it is now empty and does not retain any previous values. The other variables (`res`, `i`, and `row`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `nRow` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is '', `res` includes previous value, `i` is 1, `row` is an input string**
