Output State: **`nRow` is a string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', while all other characters remain unchanged. If `row` is non-empty, the loop will execute once for each character in `row`. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string, `res` retains its previous value, and `row` continues to be empty.**
