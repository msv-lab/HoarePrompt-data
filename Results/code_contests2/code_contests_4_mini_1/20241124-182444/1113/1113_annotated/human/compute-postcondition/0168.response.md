The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to it. Since `nRow` is updated based on the next character in `row`, its previous value is not specified but it will now include '1' at the end. The value of `row` remains unchanged, and `i` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is updated to include '1', `row` remains a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated to include '1', `row` remains a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
