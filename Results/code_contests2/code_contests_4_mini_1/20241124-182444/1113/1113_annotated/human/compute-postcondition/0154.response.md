According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 (the initial value), and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Since there is no information about the increment of `i` within the loop body (which is omitted), we can only assume that `i` will increment by 1 in each iteration. Thus, to prepare for the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

No other states need adjustment as `nRow` and `res` are not affected by the loop's condition. 

State: **`nRow` is a string where every '9' in `row` is replaced with '1'; `res` now includes `nRow`, `i` is 1**
