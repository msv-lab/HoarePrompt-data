The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The previous value of `nRow` is an empty string, and `i` is an integer not equal to '9'. When an integer is added to a string, it typically results in a TypeError in Python, but for this simulation, we will assume the integer is converted to a string and concatenated. Thus, `nRow` will now be equal to the string representation of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is an integer not equal to '9', `row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is the string representation of `i`**
