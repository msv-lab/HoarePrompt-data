The variable `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a user input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and since `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `T` will also be a positive integer. The output state remains unchanged for other variables. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity (float('inf')); `res` is an empty list; `T` is an input integer.**
