The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take a user input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of `nRow`, `res`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `nRow`, `res`, and `i`, and reflects the new value for `row` based on user input.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string where every '9' in `row` is replaced with '1'; `res` now includes `nRow`, `i` is 1, and `row` is an input string**
