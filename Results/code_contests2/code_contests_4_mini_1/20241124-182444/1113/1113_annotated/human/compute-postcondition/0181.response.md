The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to `nRow`. Initially, `nRow` is an empty string, and `i` is 0. After the execution, `nRow` will contain the string representation of `i`, which is '0'. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '0', `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is '0', `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
