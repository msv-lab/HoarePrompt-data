`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. The previous value of `nRow` is '11', so the new value will be '111'. The values of `res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is '111'.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is '111'**
