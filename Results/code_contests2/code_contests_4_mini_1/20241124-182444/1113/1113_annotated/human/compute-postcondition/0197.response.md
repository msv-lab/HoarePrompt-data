Output State: **If `T` is at least 1, `res` will contain `T` strings, each being a transformation of the corresponding input `row` where every '9' is replaced by '1'. If `T` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty list. If any input `row` is empty, the corresponding `nRow` will also be an empty string, leading to an empty string being appended to `res`. If the loop executes fewer than 9 times due to interruption or errors, `res` will contain only the strings processed up to that point.**
