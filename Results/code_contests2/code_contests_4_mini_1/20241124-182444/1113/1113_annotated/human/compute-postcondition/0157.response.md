According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` string. For the loop to execute, `row` must be a non-empty string. Since `i` is initialized to 1, it implies that the loop is set to start iterating from the first character of `row`. However, `nRow` being an empty string does not directly affect the loop execution. 

In summary, for the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one character, and `i` should be properly indexed. The initial value of `i` should start from 0 since Python strings are zero-indexed, but since it is currently set to 1, we can leave it as is for the iteration to begin from the second character.

State: **`nRow` is '', `res` includes previous value, `i` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string**
