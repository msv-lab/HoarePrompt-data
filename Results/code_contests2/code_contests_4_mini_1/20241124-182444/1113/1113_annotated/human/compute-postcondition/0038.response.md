The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to its previous value. The values of `row`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1', `res` retains its previous value, `i` is the next character in the string `row`**
