`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The values of `row`, `res`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `res` includes the previous `nRow`, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `res` includes the previous `nRow`, `i` is equal to '9'**
