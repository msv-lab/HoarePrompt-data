According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will iterate over each character in the string. Given that `i` is already set to 9, and since we typically use `i` as the loop variable, it should be adjusted to the first character in the string `row`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed properly, `i` should be set to 0 (the index of the first character in the string), and `row` must remain a non-empty string. The variable `nRow` and `res` do not affect whether the loop will execute but should be noted for their initial states.

State: **`row` is a new non-empty string from input, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` includes the previous `nRow`, `i` is 0**
