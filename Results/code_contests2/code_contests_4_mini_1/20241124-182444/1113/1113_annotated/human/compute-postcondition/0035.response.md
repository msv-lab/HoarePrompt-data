The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to the string `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` is an empty string. Since `i` is an integer that is not equal to 9, it will be converted to its string representation when appended. 

Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a new non-empty string from input, `nRow` is now the string representation of `i`, `res` includes the previous `nRow`, and `i` is an integer not equal to 9.

Output State: **`row` is a new non-empty string from input, `nRow` is now the string representation of `i`, `res` includes the previous `nRow`, `i` is an integer not equal to 9**
