Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string that has '1' appended to it if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` has the value of `i` appended to it (which is a string representation of an integer from 0 to 8), and `res` contains the updated value of `nRow`. The variable `row` remains a non-empty string throughout.***
