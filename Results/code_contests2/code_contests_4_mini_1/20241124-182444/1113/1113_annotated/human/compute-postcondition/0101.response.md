The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value. The variable `res` holds the previous value of `nRow`, but it is not affected by this operation. The variable `i` remains unchanged, and `row` continues to be a non-empty string with at least one additional character. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1'; `res` is the previous value of `nRow`; `i` is the last character of `row`; `row` is a non-empty string with at least one additional character.**
