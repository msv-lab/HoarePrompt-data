The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `i`, and `row`), which retain their previous states. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the new assignment.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string stripped of whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string**
