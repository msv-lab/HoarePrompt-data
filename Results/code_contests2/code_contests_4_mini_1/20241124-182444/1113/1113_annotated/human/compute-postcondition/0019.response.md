The variable `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, but the previous value of `nRow` is not specified, and the value of `i` is also unknown. Therefore, we can only indicate that `nRow` will be updated based on the increment. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and `nRow` will be updated by adding `i`**.
