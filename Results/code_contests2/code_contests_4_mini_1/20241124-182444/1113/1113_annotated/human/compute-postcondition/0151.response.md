According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third character of `row`. Since `row` is a string with at least 3 characters, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least 4 characters, and `i` must be updated to the fourth character of `row`.

State: **`res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a string with at least 4 characters, and `i` is the fourth character of `row`.**
