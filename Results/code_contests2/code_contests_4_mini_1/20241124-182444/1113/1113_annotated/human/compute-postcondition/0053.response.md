The value of `nRow` is incremented by appending '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `res` is an empty string, `row` is a non-empty trimmed string, and the first character of `row` is '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` is an empty string, `row` is a non-empty trimmed string, and the first character of `row` is '9'**.
