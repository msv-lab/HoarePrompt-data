The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous value of `nRow` is a transformed version of the `row`, but since it is being reset to an empty string, it will no longer hold that previous value. The states of the other variables (`row`, `res`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a new non-empty string from input, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` includes the previous `nRow`, and `i` is 9.

Output State: **`row` is a new non-empty string from input, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` includes the previous `nRow`, `i` is 9**
