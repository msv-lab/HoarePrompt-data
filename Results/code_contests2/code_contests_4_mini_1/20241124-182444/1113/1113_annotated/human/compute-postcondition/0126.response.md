The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i` to it. Since `nRow` starts as an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will contain the character `i`. The values of `i` and `row` are not changed, and `row` still has at least one character remaining. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is the character `i`, `i` is the next character from `row`, and `row` has at least one character remaining.

Output State: **`nRow` is the character `i`, `i` is the next character from `row`, and `row` has at least one character remaining**
