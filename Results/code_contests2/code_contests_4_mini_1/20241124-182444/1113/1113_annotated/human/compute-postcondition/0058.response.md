The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string `'1'`. Since `nRow` is the second character of `row`, it will now include that character followed by `'1'`. The values of `res` and `row` remain unchanged, while `i` (the first character of `row`) is also unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is the second character of `row` concatenated with '1', `res` remains an empty string, `row` continues to be a non-empty trimmed string, and `i` is the first character of `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is the second character of `row` concatenated with '1', `res` remains an empty string, `row` continues to be a non-empty trimmed string, and `i` is the first character of `row`**
