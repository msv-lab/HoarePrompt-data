Postcondition: ***`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string `row`, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with '1', while `res` retains its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with `i`, and `res` retains its previous value.***
