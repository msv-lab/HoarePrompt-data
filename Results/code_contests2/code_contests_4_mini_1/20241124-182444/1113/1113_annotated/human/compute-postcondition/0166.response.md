Postcondition: ***`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`; if `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to its previous value plus '1'. If `i` is any character other than '9', `nRow` is updated by appending `i` to its previous value. `row` remains a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, and `i` represents the next character in `row`.***
