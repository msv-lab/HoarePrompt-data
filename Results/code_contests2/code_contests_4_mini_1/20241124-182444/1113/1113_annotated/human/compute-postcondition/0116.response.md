The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the operation, `nRow` will become '1'. The other variables `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `res` retains the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` retains the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace**
