According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a string that starts as an empty string, and if `i` is '9', `nRow` becomes '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` includes the character `i`.

Given that `i` is currently being processed from `row`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one character remaining in `row`. 

- If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '1' and `row` must have at least one more character left after the character processed in this iteration.
- If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` includes `i`, and similarly, `row` must have at least one more character left.

Since the loop is iterating over `row`, we can conclude that we need to ensure that `row` has at least one more character remaining after the character processed in the last iteration.

State: **`nRow` is a string that starts as an empty string, `row` has at least one character remaining**
