`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. Since `nRow` starts as an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The values of the other variables `i` and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '1', `i` is the next character from `row`, `row` has at least one character remaining.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `i` is the next character from `row`, `row` has at least one character remaining**
