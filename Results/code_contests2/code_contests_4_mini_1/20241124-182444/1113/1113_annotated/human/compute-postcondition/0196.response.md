According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 9, and `T` must be greater than 9 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, to allow for one more execution of the loop, `T` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 9. Additionally, `t` should be adjusted to 10 for the next iteration. 

State: **`res` will contain 9 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 10**
