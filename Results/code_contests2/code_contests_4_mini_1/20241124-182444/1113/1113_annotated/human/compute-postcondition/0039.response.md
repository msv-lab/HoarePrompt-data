The code increments `nRow` by appending the character `i` to it. Since `i` is the next character in the string `row`, it will add this character to the existing value of `nRow`. The states of `res` and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated by appending `i`, `res` retains its previous value, `i` is the next character in the string `row`**
