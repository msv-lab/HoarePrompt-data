According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the `row` string. For the loop to execute, `row` must not be empty (i.e., it should contain at least 1 character after stripping whitespace). 

Since `i` is currently set to 8, it does not play a role in the execution of the loop, but it will be reassigned to each character in `row` during the loop's execution. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `row` must be a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, and `i` should be reset to the first character in `row` during the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`nRow` is '', `res` retains the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace**
