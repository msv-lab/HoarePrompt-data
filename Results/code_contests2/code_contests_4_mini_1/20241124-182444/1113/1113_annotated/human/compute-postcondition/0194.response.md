According to the code, the for loop will execute a total of 9 times, with `i` ranging from 0 to 8. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have reached 8. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 9.

There are no adjustments needed for `nRow` or `res` as they do not affect the loop's condition, which strictly depends on the value of `i`.

State: **`nRow` is a string where every occurrence of '9' is replaced by '1', `res` now contains the updated value of `nRow`, `i` is 9**
