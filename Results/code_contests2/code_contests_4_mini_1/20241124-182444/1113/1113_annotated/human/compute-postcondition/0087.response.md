Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is the next character in `row` after the current one, `T` is greater than or equal to 10, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after `i`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i` to its previous value.***
