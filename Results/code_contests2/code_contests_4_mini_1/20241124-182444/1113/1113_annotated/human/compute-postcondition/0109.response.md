Output State: **`nRow` is a string formed by concatenating '1' for every '9' found in `row` and the other characters from `row` as they are; `res` retains the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is the last character processed from `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string that the loop iterates through. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, leaving `nRow` as an empty string and `res` also as an empty string.**
