The variable `nRow` is assigned a new value by concatenating '1' to its current value, which is an empty string. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The variable `row` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character left to process**
