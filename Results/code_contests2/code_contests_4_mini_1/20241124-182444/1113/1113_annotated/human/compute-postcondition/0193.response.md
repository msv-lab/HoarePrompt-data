The `res` list has the `nRow` appended to it. Since `nRow` is already a string where every occurrence of '9' is replaced by '1', and all other characters remain unchanged, the value of `res` will now include that updated value of `nRow`. If `row` is an empty string, both `nRow` and `res` will be empty. 

The output state reflects the current values of `nRow` and `res` after the append operation.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string where every occurrence of '9' is replaced by '1' (or an empty string if `row` is empty), `res` now contains the updated value of `nRow` (or remains empty if `nRow` is empty).**
