Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string that starts as an empty string. If the first character `i` of the non-empty string `row` is '9', then `nRow` becomes '1'. If `i` is any character other than '9', `nRow` is updated to include that character. The variable `res` retains the value of `nRow` before the update, which could either be '1' or the character from `row` depending on the situation.***
