The code appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The initial state indicates that `nRow` is derived from a string `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1'. If `row` is empty, `nRow` is also empty; if `row` has at least one character, `nRow` is at least 1 character long. 

Since the operation only modifies the list `res` by adding `nRow` to it, the output state reflects the existing values of `nRow` and the fact that `nRow` has been appended to `res`. The state of `res` will now include `nRow`.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string where every '9' in `row` is replaced with '1'; `res` now includes `nRow`**
