According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must not be an empty string; it needs to contain at least one character. 

Currently, `nRow` is an empty string, and `res` has `nRow` appended to it, which does not provide any relevant information about `row`. The variable `i` is set to 9, which is not relevant to the execution of the loop since it will be overwritten by the first character of `row` during the first iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute, `row` must be a non-empty string, and for the loop to start, `i` should be reset to 0 to represent the first character of `row`.

State: **`nRow` is '', `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string**
