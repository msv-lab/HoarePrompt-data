The code appends '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` depends on the characters in `row` as described in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will be the original value with '1' concatenated to the end. The other variables `res` and `row` remain unchanged, and `i` continues to point to the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is the second character of `row` concatenated with '1' if `i` is '9', or the second character of `row` followed by `i` and then concatenated with '1'; `res` remains empty; `row` continues to be a non-empty trimmed string; `i` is the next character in `row`.**
