The variable `row` is assigned the value of the input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. The previous value of `nRow` is a string where every '9' in `row` is replaced by '1', and `res` has `nRow` appended to it, while `i` is 9. The input does not affect `nRow`, `res`, or `i`, but it determines the new value of `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string where every '9' in `row` is replaced by '1', `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string stripped of whitespace**.
