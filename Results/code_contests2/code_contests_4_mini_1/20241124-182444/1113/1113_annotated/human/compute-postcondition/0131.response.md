According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` values ranging from 0 to 8 (inclusive) since `range(9)` generates numbers starting from 0 up to, but not including, 9. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` must be 8, which is the last value for which the loop can execute, as the next value (9) would exceed the limit set by the range.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9. However, since the loop is structured to stop before reaching 9, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`nRow` will be a string that contains all characters from `row`, replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1'; `res` now contains the previous value of `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9**
