The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is 1 (which is an integer), it will be implicitly converted to a string during the concatenation. Therefore, `nRow` will now hold the value '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` includes previous value, `i` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
