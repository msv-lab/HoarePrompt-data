The variable `nRow` is being concatenated with the string '1'. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `nRow`, we cannot determine the exact result of this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` is now `nRow + '1'`, but we cannot specify the exact value without knowing the initial value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `row` is a non-empty string with at least two more characters, and `nRow` is now concatenated with '1'.**
