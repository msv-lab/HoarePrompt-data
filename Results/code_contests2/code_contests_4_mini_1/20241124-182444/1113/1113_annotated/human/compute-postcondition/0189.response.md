The variable `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. Since `i` can either be '9' or some other value, if `i` is '9', '1' will be appended to `nRow`, otherwise `i` will be appended. The variable `res` will contain this updated value of `nRow`. The value of `row` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `res` contains the updated value of `nRow`, and `row` is unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `res` contains the updated value of `nRow`, and `row` is unchanged.**
