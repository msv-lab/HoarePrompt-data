According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to 8 (inclusive) for a total of 9 iterations. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its maximum value of 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to 9, which is outside the range specified in `range(9)`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted because `nRow` and `res` are not directly impacting the loop's ability to execute; they are simply the results of the operations in the loop body.

State: **`nRow` is a string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged; `res` now contains `nRow`, `i` is 8**
