The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The other variables (`res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `nRow` is an empty string**.
