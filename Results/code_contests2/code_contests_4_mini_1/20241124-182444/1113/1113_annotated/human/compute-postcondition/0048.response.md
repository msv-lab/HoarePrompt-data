According to the code, the loop is dependent on the variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to 8 (inclusive) as specified by `range(9)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8. Therefore, to allow for one more iteration, `i` needs to be incremented to 9, which will cause the loop to terminate since it will no longer satisfy the condition of `i < 9`.

No other states need to be adjusted as `nRow` and `res` do not affect the loop's execution in this case.

State: **`nRow` is a string where every '9' in `row` has been replaced by '1', `res` retains the previous value of `nRow`, and `res` now includes `nRow` as a new element, `i` is 9**
