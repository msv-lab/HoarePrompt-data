According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`, which is a non-empty string. At the end of the last iteration, `i` represents the current character in `row`. 

If `row` is non-empty, `i` will take on the next character in `row` during the next iteration. Since `row` remains a non-empty string throughout, we need to determine the current position of `i` in `row` and adjust accordingly for the next iteration. 

Assuming `i` is the last character processed in the previous iteration, we must increment `i` to the next character in `row`. If `i` is currently the last character, then to execute one more time, we must ensure that `i` points to the next character, which must be valid within the bounds of `row`.

Since `i` is a character from `row`, we need to adjust it to ensure it points to the next character. Therefore, we need to specify that `i` is now the next character in `row`, and since `row` is non-empty, it must have a length greater than the current index of `i`.

State: **`nRow` is a string that has '1' appended to it if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` has the value of the next character in `row`, `res` contains the updated value of `nRow`, `row` remains a non-empty string**
