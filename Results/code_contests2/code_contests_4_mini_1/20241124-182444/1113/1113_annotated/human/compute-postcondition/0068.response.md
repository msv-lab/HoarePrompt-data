According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently less than 9. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Since `i` can be assumed to be starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 each iteration, we can infer that `i` must be adjusted to 1 (if it was 0) at the start of the next iteration. However, without the specific value of `i`, we can only say that `i` needs to be incremented.

The other variables, `nRow`, `res`, and `row`, do not need to be adjusted based on the for loop structure given.

Thus, we only need to reflect that `i` has been incremented by 1.

State: **`nRow` is a string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1'; `res` now contains `nRow` appended to it; `row` remains unchanged, `i` is 1**
