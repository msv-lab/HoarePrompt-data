According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row`. If `row` contains more characters, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string and `i` is the current character from `row`. 

To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what happens to `i` in the loop. Since `i` is iterating over the characters in `row`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be updated to the next character in the string.

If `i` was the last character in `row`, then there will be no more characters left, and the loop will not execute again. However, since it is stated that `row` is a non-empty string, we can conclude that `row` must still have characters remaining for the loop to execute again.

Assuming that `i` is currently pointing to a character in `row`, we need to adjust `i` to the next character, which would be the subsequent character in the string. The exact value of `nRow` and `res` does not need to be adjusted because they retain their previous values, but we do not need to know the contents of `row` to know that `i` must change.

Thus, since `row` is non-empty, we will set `i` to the next character in `row`. 

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string `row`, `nRow` retains its previous value, `res` retains its previous value**
