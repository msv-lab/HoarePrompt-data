The code assigns the value of `input().strip()` to the variable `row`. The value of `row` will depend on the user input, which is not specified here. The initial values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged, and `T` is still greater than or equal to 10. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 10, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 10, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace**
