According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row`. The loop will continue to iterate as long as there are characters left in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `row` still has characters remaining after the current character `i`. Since `i` is the next character in `row`, we need to adjust the state to reflect the next character after `i`. 

Assuming that `row` originally contained multiple characters, and `i` is currently pointing to one of those characters, we can specify that `row` has at least one more character left after `i`.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is the next character in `row` after the current one, `T` is greater than or equal to 10, and `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace containing at least one more character after `i`.**
