Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string, `res` is the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is a string representation of an integer, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with the string representation of `i`. This ensures that if `i` is '9', `nRow` will always include '1', and for any other value of `i`, it will be appended directly to `nRow`, maintaining the integrity of `row` as a non-empty string.***
