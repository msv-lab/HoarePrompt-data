The operation `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to the string `nRow`. The initial state indicates that `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is not equal to '9'. Since `i` holds some character value (other than '9'), it will be added to `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` is an empty string, so after the operation, `nRow` will become a string containing the character value of `i`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is now equal to `i`.**
