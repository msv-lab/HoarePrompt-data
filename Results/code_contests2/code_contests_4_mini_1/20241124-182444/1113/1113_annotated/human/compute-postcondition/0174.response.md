According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which iterates over a range of 9. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8, as it is the last value before the loop would exit when it reaches 9. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9, which means the loop cannot execute again since the range is from 0 to 8. 

No other states need to be adjusted because `nRow` and `res` are not relevant for the continuation of the loop; they are part of the loop's body, and their state does not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`nRow` is a string where every '9' in `row` is replaced by '1', and `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9**
