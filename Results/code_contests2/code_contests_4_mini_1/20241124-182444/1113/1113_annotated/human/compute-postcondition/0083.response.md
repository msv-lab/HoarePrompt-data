Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is the next character in `row`, `T` is greater than or equal to 10, and `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is updated to include '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to include the value of `i`, which can be any character from the string `row` as long as it is not '9'.***
