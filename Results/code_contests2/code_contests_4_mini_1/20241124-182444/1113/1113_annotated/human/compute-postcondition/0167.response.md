According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop will execute one more time as long as there are remaining characters in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, and `i` represents the next character in `row`.

Since `i` is now pointing to the next character in `row`, we need to update `i` to reflect the next character for the upcoming iteration. The state of `nRow` also needs to be adjusted based on the new value of `i`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` will be updated to its previous value plus '1'. If `i` is any character other than '9', `nRow` will be updated by appending `i` to its previous value.

Thus, we need to adjust `i` to the next character in `row`, and based on that character, adjust `nRow` accordingly.

State: **`nRow` is updated based on the next character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, `i` is the next character in `row`**
