The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take user input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `nRow` and `res` are not directly affected by this statement, but `row` will now hold the new input value. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 8. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `nRow`, `res`, and the updated `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged; `res` now contains `nRow`, `i` is 8, and `row` is the new user input string**
