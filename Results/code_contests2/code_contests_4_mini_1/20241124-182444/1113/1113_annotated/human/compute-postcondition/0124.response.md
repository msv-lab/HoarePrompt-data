To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Current State Information**:
   - `nRow` is a string that starts as an empty string.
   - If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'.
   - Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending `i`, where `i` is any character from `row`.
   - `row` remains a non-empty string with at least one character left to process.

2. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `row`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one character remaining in `row` to process.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `row` is non-empty at the end of the last iteration, there is at least one character remaining in `row` that will be assigned to `i` in the next iteration.
   - The variable `i` will take the next character from `row`, and `nRow` will be updated according to whether `i` is '9' or some other character.

Given that the loop is designed to process all characters in `row`, if there are characters left in `row`, the next character will be processed, and the state will need to reflect that `i` will take on the next character from `row`.

Thus, we adjust the state as follows:
- `row` still has characters left to process.
- `i` will be the next character from `row`.

State: **`nRow` is a string that starts as an empty string, `i` is the next character from `row`, `row` has at least one character remaining**.
