Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` will contain '1' if `i` is '9'; otherwise, `nRow` will be updated to include the value of `i`, which is not equal to '9'.***
