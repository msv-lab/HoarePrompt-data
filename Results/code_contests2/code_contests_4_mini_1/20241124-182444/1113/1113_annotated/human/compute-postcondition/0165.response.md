The value of `nRow` is updated by appending `i` to it. Since `i` represents the next character in `row`, `nRow` now contains its previous contents plus this new character. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is updated with the next character from `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated with the next character from `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
