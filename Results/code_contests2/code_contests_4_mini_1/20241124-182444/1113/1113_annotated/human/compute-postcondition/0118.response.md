The code `nRow += i` appends the character `i` to the string `nRow`. Initially, `nRow` is an empty string, so after this operation, `nRow` will contain the character `i`. The variable `res` retains the previous value of `nRow`, which was an empty string, so `res` will also be an empty string before the operation. The string `row` is non-empty and has been stripped of whitespace, but its specific value does not impact the operation performed by the code.

Output State: **`nRow` is `i`, `res` is an empty string, `i` is a character from `row` that is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace**
