The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string value. This does not affect any of the other variables (`res`, `i`, `T`, or `row`), so the output state reflects the unchanged status of these variables along with the new value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 10, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is ''**
