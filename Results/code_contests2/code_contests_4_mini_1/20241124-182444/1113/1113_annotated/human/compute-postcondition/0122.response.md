The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` starts as an empty string, the result will depend on the value of `i`. The variable `row` remains unaffected in this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is `i`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character left to process.

Output State: **`nRow` is `i`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character left to process**
