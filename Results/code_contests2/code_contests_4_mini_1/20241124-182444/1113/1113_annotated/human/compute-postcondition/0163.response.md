According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `row`. The variable `i` takes on each value from `row` during the iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a string that starts as empty, and depending on the value of `i`, it has been updated accordingly. 

If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. If `i` is any other value, `nRow` includes the value of `i`. Since `row` remains a non-empty string, it must contain at least one more character for the loop to execute again.

Since no specific information about the content of `row` is provided, we need to ensure that `row` still has remaining characters for the next iteration. The value of `i` will change to the next character in `row`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `row` to still have characters left and set `i` to the next character in `row`. 

State: **`nRow` is updated correctly based on the previous value of `i`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, `i` is the next character in `row`.**
