According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more characters in the `row` string for the variable `i` to take on. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `row` is still a non-empty trimmed string. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must still contain additional characters after the current character `i`.

Since `nRow` is derived from the second character of `row` and modified based on `i`, we need to ensure that `i` is updated to the next character in `row` for the next iteration. The length of `row` must also be greater than the position of the current character `i`.

Thus, if `i` is the current character, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `row` to have at least one more character after `i`. 

State: **`nRow` is the second character of `row` followed by '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is the second character of `row` followed by the next character in `row`, `res` remains empty, and `row` continues to be a non-empty trimmed string with `i` being the next character in `row` that still exists.**
