According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are still characters remaining in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining. Since we're iterating over `row`, the character `i` will be updated to the next character in `row` for the next iteration. 

The main condition here is that `row` must be non-empty, and since `row` has at least one character remaining at the end of the last iteration, it will contain at least one additional character for the next loop iteration.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `row` is still a non-empty string and that `i` is updated to the next character in `row`. 

State: **`nRow` is updated based on the next character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
