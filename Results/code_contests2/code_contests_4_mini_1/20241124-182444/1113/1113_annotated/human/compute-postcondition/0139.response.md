The value of `nRow` is incremented by appending the string '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the operation, `nRow` will contain the string '1'. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a string with at least 1 character, and `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a string with at least 1 character, and `nRow` is '1'**
