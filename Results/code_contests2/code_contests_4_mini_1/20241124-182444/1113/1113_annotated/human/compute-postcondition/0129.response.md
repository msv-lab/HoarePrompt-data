Output State: **`nRow` will be a string that contains all characters from `row`, replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1'. If `row` is non-empty, the loop will execute for each character in `row`. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string. `res` retains the previous value of `nRow` before the loop execution, which could be an empty string or the modified string after the loop.**
