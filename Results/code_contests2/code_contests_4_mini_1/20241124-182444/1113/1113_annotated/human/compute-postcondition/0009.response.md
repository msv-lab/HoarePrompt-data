The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string stripped of whitespace.
