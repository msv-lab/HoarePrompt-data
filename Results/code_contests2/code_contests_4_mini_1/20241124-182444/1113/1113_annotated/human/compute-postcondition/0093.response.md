The code assigns an empty string to `nRow`, which means that the previous value of `nRow` is overwritten. The variables `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `nRow` as an empty string while indicating the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`nRow` is '', `res` is the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 8, `row` is the new user input string**
