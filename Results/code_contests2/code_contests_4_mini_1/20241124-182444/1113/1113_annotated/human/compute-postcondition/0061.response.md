According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty trimmed string, meaning it contains at least one character. The variable `i` is the current character being iterated over in the string `row`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must still be a non-empty string, and `i` must move to the next character in `row`. If `i` is currently the last character of `row`, the loop will not execute again.

Since we are not given the exact length of `row`, we can only state that it must still be non-empty, and the next character must be available.

Assuming `i` is not the last character of `row`, we need to ensure that `row` remains non-empty for the next iteration. Therefore, we can adjust the states as follows:

State: **`nRow` is the second character of `row` concatenated with '1' if the first character `i` of `row` is '9'; otherwise, `nRow` is the second character of `row` followed by the first character `i`, `res` remains empty, `row` continues to be a non-empty trimmed string, `i` is the next character in `row`.**
