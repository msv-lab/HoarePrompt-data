The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the operation, `nRow` becomes '1'. The variable `res` is assigned the previous value of `nRow`, which was an empty string. The variable `i` remains unchanged at '9', and `row` remains a non-empty string. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '1', `res` is an empty string, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` is an empty string, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string**
