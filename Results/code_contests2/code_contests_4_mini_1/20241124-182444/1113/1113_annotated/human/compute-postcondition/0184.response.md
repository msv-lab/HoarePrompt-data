The value of `nRow` is incremented by appending '1' to it. The previous values indicate that if `i` is '9', `nRow` already has '1' appended, otherwise it contains the next character from `row`. Regardless, '1' will be added to the current value of `nRow`. The states of `res` and `row` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` has been updated.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated to include an additional '1', `res` contains the updated value of `nRow`, `row` remains a non-empty string**
