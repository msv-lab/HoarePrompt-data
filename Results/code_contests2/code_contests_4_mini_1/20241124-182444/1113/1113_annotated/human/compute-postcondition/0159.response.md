The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to it. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The values of `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `res` includes previous value, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` includes previous value, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string**
