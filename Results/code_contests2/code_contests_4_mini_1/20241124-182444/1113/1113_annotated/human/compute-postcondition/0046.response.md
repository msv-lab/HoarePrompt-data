Output State: **`nRow` is a string where every '9' in `row` has been replaced by '1', and all other characters in `row` are preserved in their original order. `res` retains the previous value of `nRow`. The loop executes once for each character in `row`. If `row` is non-empty, the loop executes for all its characters, updating `nRow` accordingly. If `row` is empty (though stated as non-empty in the initial state), `nRow` remains an empty string and `res` remains unchanged.**
