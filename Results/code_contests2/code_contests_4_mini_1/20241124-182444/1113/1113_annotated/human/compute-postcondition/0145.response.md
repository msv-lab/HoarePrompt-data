The variable `nRow` is updated by concatenating it with `i`. Since `nRow` is initially '1' and `i` is the second character of the string `row`, the new value of `nRow` will be '1' concatenated with the character represented by `i`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the string `row`, and `nRow` is updated to '1' concatenated with `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the string `row`, and `nRow` is updated to '1' concatenated with `i`**
