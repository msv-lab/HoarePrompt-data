The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to `nRow`. The variable `i` is the next character in `row` after the current one, and since `row` is a non-empty string containing at least one more character after `i`, `i` must be a valid character. The values of `res` and `T` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the updated state of `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is the next character in `row`, `T` is greater than or equal to 10, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated with the character `i`.**
