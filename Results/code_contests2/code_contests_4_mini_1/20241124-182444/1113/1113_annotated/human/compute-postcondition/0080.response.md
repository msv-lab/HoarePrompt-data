According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string at the end of the last iteration, it will have at least one character.

If `i` is either '9' or '0', it indicates that the loop has processed one character from `row`. The next iteration will process the next character in the string. 

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `i` to reflect the next character in the `row` string. If `row` has multiple characters, we need to ensure that `i` will point to the next character. We also need to maintain that `nRow` is updated accordingly: if `i` was '9', `nRow` would be updated to '0' for the next iteration, and if `i` was '0', `nRow` would be updated to '1'.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure the following:
- `row` remains a non-empty string.
- Update `i` to the next character in `row`.
- Update `nRow` based on the new value of `i`.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is the next character in `row`, `T` is greater than or equal to 10, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is updated based on the new value of `i`.**
