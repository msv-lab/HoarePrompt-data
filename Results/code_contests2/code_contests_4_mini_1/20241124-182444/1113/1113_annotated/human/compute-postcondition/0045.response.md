According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the loop can continue with the next character in the string. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in the string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, this means that `i` is currently pointing to a character in `row`. To execute the loop one more time, we need to update `i` to point to the next character in `row`, which requires `row` to have at least one more character remaining.

If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with '1'. If `i` is any other character, `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with `i`. In either case, `res` retains its previous value. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is that `i` should now point to the next character after the current one.

Thus, if `i` is currently the last character in `row`, we need to ensure that `row` has at least one more character for the loop to continue.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string `row`, `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with the next character, `res` retains its previous value.**
