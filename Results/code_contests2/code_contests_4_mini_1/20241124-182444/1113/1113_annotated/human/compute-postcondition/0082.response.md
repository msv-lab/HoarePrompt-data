The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`. The value of `i` is the next character in `row`, so the new value of `nRow` will be its previous value plus the character `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is the next character in `row`, `T` is greater than or equal to 10, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` has been updated based on the new value of `i`.
