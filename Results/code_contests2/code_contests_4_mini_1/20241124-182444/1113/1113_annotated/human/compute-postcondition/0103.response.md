Postcondition: ***`nRow` is the previous value concatenated with either '1' if `i` is '9', or with the string representation of `i` if `i` is not '9'. `res` retains the value of the previous `nRow`, `i` is the last character of `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least one additional character.***
