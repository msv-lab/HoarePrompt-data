According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a string with at least 1 character, and `i` is currently equal to '9'. Therefore, `nRow` would be updated to '1' in this case.

For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least 2 characters (since it already has at least 1), and in the next iteration, `i` would take the next character from `row`. 

So, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `row` should have at least 2 characters (to allow for another iteration).
- `i` should take the next character in the row after '9'.

Thus, the new state can be summarized as:
State: **`res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, and `row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the string `row`, and `nRow` is updated to '1'**.
