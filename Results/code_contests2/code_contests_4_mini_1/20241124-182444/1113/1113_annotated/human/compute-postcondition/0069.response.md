Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, each transformed from the input `row` where every '9' is replaced by '1'. If the loop executes 0 times, `res` remains an empty list, and `row` would not exist as input is required. If fewer than 9 iterations are completed due to an interruption or error, `res` contains only the strings processed up to that point. Each `nRow` is a string derived from the corresponding `row`.**
