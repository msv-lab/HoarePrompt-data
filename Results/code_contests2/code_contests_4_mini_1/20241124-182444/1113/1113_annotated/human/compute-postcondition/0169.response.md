The code `nRow += i` appends the character `i` to the string `nRow`. Since `nRow` is updated based on the next character in `row`, we know that `i` holds the value of that next character. The other variable `row` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow` after appending `i`.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated with the next character `i` from `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining**
