According to the code, the loop is designed to execute a fixed number of times, specifically 9 times, as indicated by `range(9)`. The variable `i` serves as the loop counter, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 8. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be 8 for the loop to have executed 9 times. If `i` is currently 8, the next increment will set `i` to 9, causing the loop to terminate as the range is exclusive of 9. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted back to 8.

No other states need to be adjusted since the loop does not depend on the contents of `row` or `nRow` for its execution.

State: **`nRow` is a string formed by concatenating '1' for every '9' found in `row` and the other characters from `row` as they are; `res` retains the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 8, and `row` is a non-empty string that the loop iterates through**
