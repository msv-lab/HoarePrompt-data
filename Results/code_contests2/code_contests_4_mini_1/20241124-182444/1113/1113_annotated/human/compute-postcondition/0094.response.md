According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must be a non-empty string. 

Given that `nRow` is an empty string and `res` is the previous value of `nRow`, `row` must be set to a string that contains at least one character. The variable `i` is initialized to 8, which doesn't influence whether the loop will run since `i` will be reassigned during the loop.

To ensure that the loop can execute, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `row` must be a non-empty string (containing at least one character).
- `i` is no longer relevant at the start of the loop as it will reset with each iteration through `row`.

State: **`nRow` is '', `res` is the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 8, `row` is a non-empty string**
