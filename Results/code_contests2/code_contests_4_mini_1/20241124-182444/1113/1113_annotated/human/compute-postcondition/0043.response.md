The variable `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is the next character in the string `row`. The previous value of `nRow` remains unchanged prior to this operation, and `res` is also unaffected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string `row`, `nRow` is updated to its previous value plus `i`, and `res` retains its previous value.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string `row`, `nRow` is updated to its previous value plus `i`, `res` retains its previous value**
