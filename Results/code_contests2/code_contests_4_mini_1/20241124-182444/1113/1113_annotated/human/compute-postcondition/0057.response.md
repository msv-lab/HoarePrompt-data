To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the current state and the loop structure.

1. The loop iterates over `row`, which is a non-empty trimmed string. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more character in `row` that has not been processed yet.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` can take the value of the current character in `row`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` becomes '1'. If `i` is any character other than '9', `nRow` is updated to the value of `i`.
3. Since `i` is the current character being processed, after the current iteration, `i` must be updated to the next character in `row` for the loop to execute again.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- We need to adjust `i` to represent the next character in the string `row`.
- If `i` is currently the last character of `row`, then there will be no more characters for the loop to process, and the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, we conclude that:
- For the loop to execute again, `row` must have at least one character left after the current value of `i`.

Assuming `row` has at least two characters, and `i` is the first character of `row`, we can set `nRow` to the second character of `row` for the next iteration.

State: **`nRow` is the second character of `row`, `res` remains an empty string, `row` continues to be a non-empty trimmed string, `i` is the first character of `row`**
