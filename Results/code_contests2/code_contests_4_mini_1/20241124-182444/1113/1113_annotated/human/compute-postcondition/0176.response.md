The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous state of `nRow` was a string where every '9' in `row` was replaced by '1', but that value is no longer relevant after the assignment. The other variables `res`, `i`, and `row` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is an empty string, `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string stripped of whitespace.

Output State: **`nRow` is '', `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9, `row` is an input string stripped of whitespace**
