According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the content of `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character of `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least one additional character, meaning there are still characters left in `row` to iterate over.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be updated to the next character in `row`, and the new value of `nRow` must reflect this change. Since `row` has at least one additional character, we can denote that there is at least one more character after `i`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the following states:
1. The value of `i` should be changed to the next character in `row`.
2. The `nRow` should be concatenated with either '1' if the new `i` is '9', or with the string representation of the new `i` if it is not '9'.
3. The variable `res` should reflect the updated value of `nRow`.

State: **`nRow` is the previous value concatenated with either '1' if the new `i` is '9', or with the string representation of the new `i` if the new `i` is not '9', `res` retains the value of the updated `nRow`, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `row` is still a non-empty string with at least one character remaining.**
