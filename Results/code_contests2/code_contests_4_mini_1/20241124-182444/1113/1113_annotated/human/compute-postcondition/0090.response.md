The code `res.append(nRow)` adds the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The value of `nRow` is determined by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters unchanged. The initial state indicates that if `row` is non-empty, `nRow` will have a modified string, and if `row` is empty, `nRow` will be an empty string.

Since the state of `res` is not mentioned, we assume it can hold any values and is prepared to accept `nRow`. The output state reflects the previous calculations and the change in `res`.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged; `res` now contains `nRow`.**
