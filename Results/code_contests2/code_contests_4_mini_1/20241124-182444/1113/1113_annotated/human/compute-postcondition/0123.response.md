Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string that starts as an empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending `i`, where `i` is any character from `row`, and `row` remains a non-empty string with at least one character left to process. This ensures that `nRow` will either contain '1' or the value of `i`, reflecting the processing of the characters in `row`.***
