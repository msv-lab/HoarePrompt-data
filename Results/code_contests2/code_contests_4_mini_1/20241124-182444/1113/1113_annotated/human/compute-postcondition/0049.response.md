The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input string from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `nRow` and `res` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, `row` will now hold the trimmed input string, while `nRow` still contains the original string with '9's replaced by '1's, and `res` retains its previous value including `nRow` as a new element.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string where every '9' in `row` has been replaced by '1', `res` retains the previous value of `nRow`, and `row` is the trimmed input string.**
