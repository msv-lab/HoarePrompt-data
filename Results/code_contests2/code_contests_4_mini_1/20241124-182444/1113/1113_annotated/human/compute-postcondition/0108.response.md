According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. Since `row` is stated to remain a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`, which means that one character has already been processed. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next character must be available. This implies that `i` needs to be updated to the next character in `row`.

Given that `row` remains non-empty, we do not need to change `row`, but we need to reflect that `i` is now pointing to the next character.

Since `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, and `res` retains that updated `nRow`, it appears we don't need to modify `nRow` or `res` for the next iteration since they will naturally reflect the changes in the loop's body.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is that `i` must be the next character in `row`.

State: **`nRow` is the previous value, `res` retains the value of the updated `nRow`, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `row` remains a non-empty string with at least one character remaining.**
