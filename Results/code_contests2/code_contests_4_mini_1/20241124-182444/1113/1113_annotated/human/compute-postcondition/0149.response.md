`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The previous value of `nRow` is '11', and `i` is the third character of `row`, which is a string of at least 3 characters. The result of concatenating '11' with `i` will depend on the actual character represented by `i`. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the final value of `nRow`. Therefore, the output state mentions the previous values and the operation performed.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, `nRow` is '11' and `nRow` is updated to '11' + `i`.**
