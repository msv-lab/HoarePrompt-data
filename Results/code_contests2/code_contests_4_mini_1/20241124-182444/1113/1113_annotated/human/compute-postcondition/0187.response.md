To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop's variables and the conditions under which it will continue to run.

1. The loop iterates over `row`, which is a non-empty string. This means that `row` has at least one character.
2. The loop variable `i` takes on each character of `row` in successive iterations. The current state indicates that `nRow` has '1' appended to it if `i` is '9', otherwise it has `i` appended to it.
3. Since `row` is a string and non-empty, the iteration over it will continue until every character in `row` has been processed. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- The value of `i` will be the last character of `row`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `row` needs to have another character available. This means that `row` should have at least one more character after the current `i`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration:
- If `row` has `n` characters, after processing the last character, `i` must be incremented to point to the next character (which does not exist if `i` is the last character).
- Therefore, we need to adjust `row` to have at least one more character than at the end of the last iteration.

**Conclusion:**
State: **`nRow` is a string that has '1' appended to it if `i` is '9', otherwise, it has `i` appended to it, `res` contains the updated value of `nRow`, and `row` is a string with at least one more character than before.**
