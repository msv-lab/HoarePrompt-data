The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the current value of `nRow` with `i`. Since `nRow` is the second character of `row` and `i` is the first character of `row`, the new value of `nRow` will be the second character of `row` followed by the first character of `row`. The value of `res` remains unchanged as it is still an empty string. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is the second character of `row` followed by the first character of `row`, `res` is an empty string, `row` continues to be a non-empty trimmed string, and `i` is the first character of `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is the second character of `row` followed by the first character of `row`, `res` is an empty string, `row` continues to be a non-empty trimmed string, `i` is the first character of `row`**
