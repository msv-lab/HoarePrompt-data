Output State: **`nRow` is a string where every occurrence of '9' in `row` is replaced by '1', and all other characters (0 to 8) remain unchanged; `res` contains the updated value of `nRow`. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `nRow` remains an empty string, while `res` will also be an empty string.**
