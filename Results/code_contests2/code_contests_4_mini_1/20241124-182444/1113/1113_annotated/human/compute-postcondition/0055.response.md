The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. The initial state indicates that `nRow` is an empty string, and since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` is now the value of `i` concatenated to the empty string, but the specific value of `i` remains unknown.

Output State: **`nRow` is the value of `i`, `res` is an empty string, `row` is a non-empty trimmed string, and the first character of `row` is not '9'**
