Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to its original value concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to its original value concatenated with `i`.***
