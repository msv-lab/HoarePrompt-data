According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the `row` string. For the loop to execute, the `row` string must contain at least one character. Currently, `nRow` is an empty string, which indicates that `row` may not have been set to a valid value. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `row` should contain at least one character after stripping whitespace.

Additionally, since `i` is initialized to 0, it will be updated during the loop execution, but we can assume its initial value for clarity.

The states need to be adjusted to ensure that `row` is not empty after stripping whitespace and that `i` is ready to iterate through the characters in `row`.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 10, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is ''**
