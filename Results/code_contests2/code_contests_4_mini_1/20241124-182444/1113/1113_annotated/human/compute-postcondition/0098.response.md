The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the current value of `i`, which is 8, to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will be '8'. The value of `res` is assigned the previous value of `nRow`, which is still an empty string. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 8, and `row` is unchanged as well. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '8', `res` is '', `i` is 8, and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '8', `res` is '', `i` is 8, and `row` is a non-empty string**
