The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value, which is currently an empty string. Therefore, after the execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is equal to '9', `T` is greater than or equal to 10, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is '1'**
