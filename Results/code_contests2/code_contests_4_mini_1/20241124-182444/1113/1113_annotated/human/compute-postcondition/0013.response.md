The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`, which is currently an empty string. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1'**
