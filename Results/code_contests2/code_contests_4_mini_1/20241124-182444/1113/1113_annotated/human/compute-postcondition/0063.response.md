The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. The initial state describes how `nRow` was constructed based on the first character of `row`. However, since `i` is the next character in `row`, it is now appended to whatever `nRow` was previously. The state of `res` remains unchanged as it is empty. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `nRow` with the appended character `i`, while `res` remains empty.

Output State: **`nRow` is the second character of `row` concatenated with '1' if the first character `i` of `row` is '9'; otherwise, `nRow` is the second character of `row` followed by the first character `i`, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `res` remains empty**.
