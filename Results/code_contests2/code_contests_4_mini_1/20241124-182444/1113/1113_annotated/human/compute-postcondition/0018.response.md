The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is initially a non-empty string with at least one more character, the new value will be the original string followed by '1'. The other variables `t`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, and `T` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and `nRow` is updated to the original value plus '1'.**
