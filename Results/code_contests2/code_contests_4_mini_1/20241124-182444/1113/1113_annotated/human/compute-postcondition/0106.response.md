Output State: **`nRow` is the previous value concatenated with either '1' if the new `i` is '9', or with the string representation of the new `i` if the new `i` is not '9'; `res` retains the value of the updated `nRow`; `i` is the next character in `row`; `row` is still a non-empty string with at least one character remaining.**
