The code assigns an empty string to `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` was a string where every '9' in `row` had been replaced by '1', and `res` retains that value. However, now `nRow` is set to an empty string, which means its previous content is overwritten. The variable `row` remains unaffected in this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is an empty string, `res` retains the previous value of `nRow`, and `row` is the trimmed input string.

Output State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` retains the previous value of `nRow`, and `row` is the trimmed input string**.
