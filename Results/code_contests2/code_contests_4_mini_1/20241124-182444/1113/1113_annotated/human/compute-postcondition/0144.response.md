The variable `nRow` is updated by concatenating the string '1' to its current value. Since `nRow` is updated to '1', the new value of `nRow` becomes '11' after this operation. Other variables (`res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9, `row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the string `row`, and `nRow` is '11'**
