`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The values of `res`, `i`, and `row` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '1', `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string**
