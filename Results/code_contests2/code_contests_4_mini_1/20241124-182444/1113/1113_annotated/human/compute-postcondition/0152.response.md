The loop processes each character in the string `row`, replacing every occurrence of the character '9' with '1' in the resulting string `nRow`. It builds `nRow` character by character based on the content of `row`. 

If `row` contains only characters other than '9', `nRow` will simply be a copy of `row`. If `row` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string. 

The loop will always execute for each character in `row`, so if `row` contains at least one character, `nRow` will contain a string of the same length as `row`, but with all '9's replaced by '1's.

Considering these points:

Output State: **`nRow` is a string where every '9' in `row` is replaced with '1'. If `row` is empty, then `nRow` is an empty string. If `row` has at least one character, then `nRow` is at least 1 character long.**
