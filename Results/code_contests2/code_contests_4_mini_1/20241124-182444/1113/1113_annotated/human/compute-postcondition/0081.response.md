The statement `nRow += '1'` appends the string `'1'` to the current value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` was updated based on the new value of `i`, we don't have the specific previous value of `nRow`, but we know it can be any string. Therefore, `nRow` will be updated to whatever its previous value was plus the string `'1'`. 

The values of other variables (`res`, `i`, `T`, `row`) are not affected by this operation. 

Thus, the output state will reflect that `nRow` has been modified to include the new character.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is the next character in `row`, `T` is greater than or equal to 10, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'**.
