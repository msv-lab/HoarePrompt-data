Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string that starts as an empty string. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` becomes '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to include the character `i`, which is the next character from `row`, and `row` has at least one character remaining. This means that `nRow` will either be '1' (if `i` is '9') or will contain the character `i` (if `i` is not '9').***
