Postcondition: ***`row` is a non-empty string, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i` to its previous value. `res` retains its previous value, and `i` remains the next character in the string `row`.***
