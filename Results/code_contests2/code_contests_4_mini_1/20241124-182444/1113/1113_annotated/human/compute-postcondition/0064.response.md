Postcondition: ***`nRow` is the second character of `row` followed by '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is the second character of `row` followed by the first character `i`. The variable `res` remains empty, and `row` continues to be a non-empty trimmed string with `i` being the next character in `row`.***
