The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. The previous state of `nRow` depends on whether `i` is '9' or not. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` will have '1' appended to it, and if `i` is any other character, `nRow` will have the next character in `row` appended to it. The variable `res` contains the updated value of `nRow`, and `row` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows: 
If `i` is '9', then `nRow` has '1' appended, leading to `nRow` being updated accordingly. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` has the next character in `row` appended.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`; `res` contains the updated value of `nRow`; `row` remains a non-empty string.**
