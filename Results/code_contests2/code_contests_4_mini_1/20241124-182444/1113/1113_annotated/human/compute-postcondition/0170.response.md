Postcondition: ***`nRow` is updated based on the next character `i` in `row`, which is a non-empty string. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to include '1'. If `i` is any character other than '9', `nRow` is updated to include that character. In both cases, `row` remains a non-empty string with at least one character remaining.***
