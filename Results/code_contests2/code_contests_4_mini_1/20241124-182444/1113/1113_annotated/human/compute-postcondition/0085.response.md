`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `nRow`, the output state will reflect that `nRow` is updated with '1' added to its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is the next character in `row` after the current one, `T` is greater than or equal to 10, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace containing at least one more character after `i`, and `nRow` is updated with '1' added to its previous value.**
