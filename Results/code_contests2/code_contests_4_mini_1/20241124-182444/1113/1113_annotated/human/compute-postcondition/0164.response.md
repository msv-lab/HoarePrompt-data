The variable `nRow` is updated by appending the string `'1'` to its current value. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but it is assumed to be a valid string since it has been updated correctly based on the previous value of `i`. The variable `row` is a non-empty string, but its specific value does not affect the operation performed on `nRow`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `nRow`, indicating that it now includes the additional character.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated to its previous value plus '1', `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, `i` is the next character in `row`.**
