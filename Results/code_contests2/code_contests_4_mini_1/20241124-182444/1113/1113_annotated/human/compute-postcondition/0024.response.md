Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is float('inf'), `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least two more characters; if `i` is '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1', otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
