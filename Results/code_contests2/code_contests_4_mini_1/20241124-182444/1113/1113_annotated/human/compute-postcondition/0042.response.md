The variable `nRow` is updated by concatenating the string '1' to its previous value. The values of `row`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string `row`, `nRow` retains its previous value concatenated with '1', `res` retains its previous value**
