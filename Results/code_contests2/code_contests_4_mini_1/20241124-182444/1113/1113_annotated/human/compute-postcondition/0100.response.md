According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least one more character. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a string representation of an integer, and it's the last character of `row`. Since the loop iterates over each character in `row`, if `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1', and if `i` is any other value, `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with `i`. 

After the last iteration, `i` would be the last character of `row`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character. Therefore, we need to adjust `row` to reflect that it has additional characters.

Assuming `row` had at least one character before the loop, we can increment its length by at least one character. However, since we do not have specific details about `row`, we can state that it must be non-empty and now must contain at least one additional character.

State: **`nRow` is the previous value concatenated with either '1' or the string representation of `i`, `res` is the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is the last character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one additional character**
