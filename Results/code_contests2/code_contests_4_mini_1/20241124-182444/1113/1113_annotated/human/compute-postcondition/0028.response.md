According to the code, the loop is set to iterate a fixed number of times, specifically 9 times, as indicated by `range(9)`. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increase by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 8 (the last value in the range). 

At the end of the last iteration, we do not have the value of `i` specified, but since the loop can only execute for values of `i` from 0 to 8, if the loop has just completed its final iteration, the value of `i` would be 8. 

Thus, to determine if the loop can execute one more time, we check the condition: if `i` is less than 9. Since `i` is currently 8, it cannot execute again since 8 is not less than 9. 

Therefore, there are no changes needed to the states for the loop to execute one more time because the loop has already reached its limit.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` contains a transformed version of `row` where every '9' is replaced by '1', and `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is 9**
