According to the code, the for loop iterates a fixed number of times, specifically 9 times, with the variable `i` ranging from 0 to 8. The loop will execute one more time as long as `i` is less than 9. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be 8, which is still less than 9, allowing for one more execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 9.

No other states need to be adjusted since the loop is not dependent on `row` or `nRow` for its continuation; it solely depends on the value of `i`.

State: **`res` will have `nRow` appended to it, where `nRow` is a string formed by replacing '9' with '1' in `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string or an empty string, `i` is 9**
