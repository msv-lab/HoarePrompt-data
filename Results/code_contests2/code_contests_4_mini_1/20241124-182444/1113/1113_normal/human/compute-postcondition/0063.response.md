The code appends the value of `i` to the existing string `nRow`. The initial state mentions that `nRow` is either '81' or '89' depending on the value of `i`, which is the next character in `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least 8 characters, `i` will be a valid character taken from `row`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `nRow` after the concatenation.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '81' + `i` or '89' + `i`, where `i` is the next character in `row`.**
