The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` to it. Since `nRow` is a string representation of '8' and `i` is '9', after the operation, `nRow` becomes '89'. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '89', `row` is a non-empty string with at least 9 characters, `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is '89', `row` is a non-empty string with at least 9 characters, `i` is '9'**
