According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8 (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration), and the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 9.

State: **`nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'; `res` now contains `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9**
