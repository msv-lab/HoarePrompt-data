Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` will be the original string followed by '1', making it either '11' or the string representation of the next character in `row` followed by '1'. If `i` is any other character, then `nRow` will be the original string concatenated with `i`, resulting in `nRow` being either '19' if `i` is '9' or the original string concatenated with the next character in `row`.***
