The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string `'1'` to it. The variable `row` is not affected by this operation. Since `nRow` was previously updated based on the value of `i`, we do not have its exact previous value, but it will now include an additional character. The output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value; `row` remains a non-empty string with at least 11 characters.**
