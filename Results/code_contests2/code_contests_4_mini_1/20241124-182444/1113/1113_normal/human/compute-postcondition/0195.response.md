Output State: **`res` will contain 9 strings, each representing a row input where all occurrences of '9' have been replaced by '1'. If any `row` input is empty, the corresponding `nRow` will be an empty string. If the loop does not execute (which theoretically should not happen since `T` is greater than 8, ensuring the loop executes 9 times), `res` will remain empty.**
