The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `res` and `i` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace**.
