`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. However, since `nRow` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables are unaffected. Therefore, the output state indicates that `nRow` has been modified, but we do not know its previous state. 

Output State: **`t` is 0, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is now `nRow + '1'` (previous value of `nRow` is unknown)**
