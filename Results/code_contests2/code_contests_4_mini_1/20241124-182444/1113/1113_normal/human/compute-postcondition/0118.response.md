The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, the resulting value of `nRow` will be equal to `i`. The state of `res` is updated to reflect the new value of `nRow`. The values of `i` and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is equal to `i`, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is not equal to '9', and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is equal to `i`, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is not equal to '9', and `row` is a non-empty string**.
