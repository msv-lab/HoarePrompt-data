The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the second character in `row`. Since `row` has at least 2 characters, `i` is a valid character. The variable `nRow` is affected, but the previous value of `nRow` is unknown. The other variables (`t`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, and `row`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `row` has at least 2 characters, and `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i` where `i` is the second character in `row`.**
