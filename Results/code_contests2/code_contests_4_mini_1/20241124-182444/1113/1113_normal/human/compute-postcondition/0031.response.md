According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. The loop will iterate over each character in the input string `row`. For the loop to be executed, `row` must contain at least one character. Since `i` is already set to 9, it will be overwritten by the first character of the string on the first iteration. So, for the loop to be executed, `row` must be a non-empty string, and on the first iteration, `i` will be assigned the first character of `row`.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`**
