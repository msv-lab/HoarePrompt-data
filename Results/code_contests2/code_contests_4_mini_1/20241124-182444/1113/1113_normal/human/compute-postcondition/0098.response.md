`nRow` is updated to include `i`, which is the first character of `row`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after the operation `nRow += i`, `nRow` will now hold the value of `i`. The values of `res` and `row` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is equal to `i`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is equal to `i`, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
