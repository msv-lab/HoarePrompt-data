The operation `nRow += '1'` concatenates the string '1' to the existing string `nRow`, which is currently '8'. Therefore, after the execution, `nRow` will be '81'. The other variables `row` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nRow` is '81', `row` is a non-empty string with at least 9 characters, `i` is '9'**
