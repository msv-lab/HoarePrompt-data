According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be a character in `row` that has not been processed yet.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character processed in the string `row`. Since `i` is the next character in the string, it suggests that we need to consider what comes after `i` in the string.

Assuming that `row` has more characters after `i`, the loop can execute again with the next character in `row`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to the next character after the current `i`, and `nRow` will reflect the updated value based on this new `i`.

State: **`nRow` has been updated based on `i`, `i` is the next character in `row` after the current character**
