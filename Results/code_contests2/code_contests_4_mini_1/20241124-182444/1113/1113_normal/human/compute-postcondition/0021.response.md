According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least 3 characters, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `row` has at least 2 characters, and `i` represents the second character in `row`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `row` has at least 3 characters. Additionally, since `i` corresponds to the second character in `row`, we need to adjust the index for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` must change to the third character of the updated `row`. 

State: **`t` is 0, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `row` has at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in `row`.**
