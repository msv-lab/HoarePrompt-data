Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, and `row` has at least 2 characters. If `i`, the second character in `row`, is '9', then `nRow` is updated by appending '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`, where `i` is the second character in `row`.***
