The code registers a function to be called at exit, which will write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output (file descriptor 1) using `os.write`. The initial state of the variable `t` and the redirection of `sys.stdout` do not change due to this registration, but we note that the output will eventually be influenced by whatever was written to `sys.stdout` during the program execution. Therefore, the output state is that `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and the redirection setup is in place for output at program exit.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `sys.stdout` is redirected to an instance of `io.BytesIO()`**
