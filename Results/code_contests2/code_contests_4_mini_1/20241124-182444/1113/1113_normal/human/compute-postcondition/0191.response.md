According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. If `row` has at least one more character after the current position of `i`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, which is the next character in `row`. Given that `row` is a non-empty string with at least 11 characters, and `i` is the character being processed, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration.

Since `i` is the current character in the string and the loop iterates over the characters of `row`, we need to increment the index for the next character. Assuming `i` is at the position of the last character in `row`, we need to ensure that the loop can continue by updating `i` to the next character and ensuring that the length of `row` is still sufficient for another character to be processed.

Therefore, if `nRow` has been updated based on the current value of `i`, we need to state that `i` should point to the next character in `row`. 

State: **`nRow` is updated based on the last value of `i`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 12 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`**
