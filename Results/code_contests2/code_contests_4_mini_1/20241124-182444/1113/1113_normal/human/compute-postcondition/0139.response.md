The operation `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the current value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is an empty string to begin with, after this operation, `nRow` will contain the string '1'. The other variables (`res`, `T`, `i`, and `row`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 8, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 8, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is '1'**
