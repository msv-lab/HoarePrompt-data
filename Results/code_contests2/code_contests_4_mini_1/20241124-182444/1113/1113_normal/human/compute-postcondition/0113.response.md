The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous values of the affected variables are `nRow` reflects the modified version of `row` where every occurrence of '9' is replaced with '1', `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string with leading and trailing spaces removed. Since `nRow` is now set to an empty string, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is now an empty string, `res` still contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is 9, and `row` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed.

Output State: **`nRow` is now an empty string, `res` still contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is 9, and `row` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed.**
