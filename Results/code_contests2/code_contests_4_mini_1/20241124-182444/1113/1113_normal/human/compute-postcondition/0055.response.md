The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with `i`. Given that `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is 8, the new value of `nRow` becomes '8'. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '8', `i` is 8, and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '8', `i` is 8, and `row` is a non-empty string**
