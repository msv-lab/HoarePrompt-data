The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` (an integer not equal to 9) to the string `nRow`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the operation, `nRow` will contain the string representation of the integer `i`. The values of `res`, `T`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `nRow` now contains the string representation of `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 8, `i` is an integer not equal to 9, `row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` contains the string representation of `i`**
