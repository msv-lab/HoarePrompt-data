The code appends `nRow` to the list `res`. Since `nRow` is derived from `row` by replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1' and leaving all other characters unchanged, the value of `nRow` reflects this transformation. The variable `res` will include the original string from `row` as an element. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is the transformed version of `row`, and `res` now includes the original `row` along with `nRow`.

Output State: **`nRow` is the transformed version of `row`; `res` includes the original `row` and `nRow`.**
