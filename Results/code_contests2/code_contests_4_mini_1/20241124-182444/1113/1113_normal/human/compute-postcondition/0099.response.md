Postcondition: ***`res` is updated to include `nRow`. If the first character of `row` (denoted as `i`) is '9', then `nRow` becomes '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to include the first character of `row`, which is not '9'. In both cases, `row` is a non-empty string and `nRow` is a non-empty string after the execution of the program fragment.***
