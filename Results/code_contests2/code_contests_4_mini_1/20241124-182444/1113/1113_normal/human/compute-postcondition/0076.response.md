The value of `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string `'1'`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be `'1'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 8, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 8, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '1'**
