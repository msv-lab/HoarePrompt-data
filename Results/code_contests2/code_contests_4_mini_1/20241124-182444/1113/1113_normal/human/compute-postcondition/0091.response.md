According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which ranges from 0 to 8 (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 9.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum value of 8. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9, which means it will no longer satisfy the loop condition.

No other states need to be adjusted as the loop's behavior is solely dependent on the value of `i`, and there are no conditions affecting other variables that would need to change.

State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is 9**
