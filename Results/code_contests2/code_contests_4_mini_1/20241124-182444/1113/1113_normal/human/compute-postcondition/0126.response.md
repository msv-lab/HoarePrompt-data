The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but `i` is a character from `row`, which is a non-empty string. Therefore, after executing the code, `nRow` will have an additional character at the end. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`nRow` has been updated to include the next character `i`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
