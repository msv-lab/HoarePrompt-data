Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, and `row` is a non-empty string. If the first character `i` of `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to `nRow + '1'`. Otherwise, if `i` is any character other than '9', then `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`.***
