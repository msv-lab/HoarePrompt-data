According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row` variable. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either '9' or '0', and `row` is a non-empty string. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following must be true:
- `row` must still be non-empty, and it must have at least one more character remaining for `i` to take on a new value. 
- Since `i` is updated to each character in `row`, the index of `i` will need to increase.

Given that `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, it will also need to reflect the new value of `i` in the next iteration.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to update `row` to contain at least one more character. This means that `row` should remain a non-empty string and `i` should point to the next character in the updated `row`.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 8, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is the next character in the non-empty string `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and `nRow` is updated to the string representation of `i` based on the new value of `i`.**
