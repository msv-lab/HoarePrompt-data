The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` to its current value. The variable `i` is the third character of `row`. Since `nRow` is initially defined based on the first character of `row`, the operation will extend `nRow` by adding `i` to it. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow` while the previous values of `row` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character of `row`, `nRow` is the first character of `row` concatenated with either '1' or `i`, and `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`.**
