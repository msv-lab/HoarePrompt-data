The variable `nRow` is modified by appending the character '1' to its current value. Depending on the value of `i`, `nRow` could either be '81' or '89', so after appending '1', `nRow` will become '811' or '891'. The values of `row` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is either '81' or '89', and after the operation, `nRow` is either '811' or '891'; `row` remains a non-empty string with at least 8 characters, and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '81' or '89'; after the operation, `nRow` is either '811' or '891'; `row` remains a non-empty string with at least 8 characters, and `i` is the next character in `row`.**
