According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row` using the variable `i`. The variable `row` must have additional characters for the loop to execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is the original string concatenated with the next character in `row` followed by '1'. If `i` is any other character, `nRow` is the original string concatenated with `i`.

For the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the state based on the following conditions:

1. If `i` is '9', the next character in `row` should be available, indicating that `row` must have at least one more character beyond the current position.
2. If `i` is any character other than '9', the loop will proceed to the next character in `row`, which must also be available.

Since the state provided does not specify the exact value of `i`, we need to ensure that `row` has more characters than it currently has processed.

Therefore, we can conclude that `row` must contain at least one more character than what has been processed, and `nRow` will be updated accordingly.

State: **`nRow` is the original string concatenated with the next character in `row` followed by '1', `row` has at least one more character**
