According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range specified in the loop (which is 9). The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified but since it is within the range of 9, we can assume it was 8 at the end of the last iteration (the last valid index for the loop). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9, which will cause the loop to stop executing. Therefore, we need to adjust the state accordingly. The variable `res` does not affect the continuation of the loop, but we know `nRow` has been updated to a string with '9' replaced by '1'.

Thus, we conclude:
- `nRow` remains as it is.
- `res` will now contain the updated value of `nRow` appended to it.
- `i` should be adjusted to 9 for the loop to indicate that it cannot continue.

State: **`nRow` is a string with '1' replaced by '1', `res` contains the updated value of `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9**
