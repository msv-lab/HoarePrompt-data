According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is greater than the current value of `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains 9 strings, and `t` would be 8 (the index of the last execution, since indexing starts at 0). Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be greater than 9.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings formed by replacing every '9' in each input `row` with '1', `t` is 8, `T` is greater than 9**
