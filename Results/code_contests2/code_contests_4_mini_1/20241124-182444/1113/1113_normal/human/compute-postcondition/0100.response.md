According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more characters in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character of `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must still be a non-empty string, and `i` should represent the next character in `row`. Since `nRow` is updated based on the first character of `row`, the first character `i` must be adjusted to the next character in `row`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `row` still has characters left. Letâ€™s denote that `row` has at least 2 characters left (since `i` will take the first character, and we need at least one more for the loop to run again). 

Assuming the character `i` is updated to the next character in `row`, we update `i` to the next character in the string. 

State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`**
