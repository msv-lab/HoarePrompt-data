The code snippet initializes `nRow` as an empty string. This assignment does not affect the values of `row` or `i`, which remain unchanged. The previous value of `nRow` is replaced with an empty string. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is an input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9.

Output State: **`row` is an input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9**
