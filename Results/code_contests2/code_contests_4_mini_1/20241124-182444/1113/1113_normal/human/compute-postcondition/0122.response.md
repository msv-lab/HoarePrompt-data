The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`, but the previous value of `nRow` is not specified, and the value of `i` is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` has been updated based on `i`, with no specific values provided for either variable. The state of the other variable `row` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated based on `i`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character**
