According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more characters in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a string with at least 3 characters, and `i` is the third character in `row`. 

To determine the state for the next iteration:
- If `i` is the third character, then for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least 4 characters. 
- Thus, `row` needs to be adjusted to reflect that it now has at least 4 characters, and `i` should be updated to the fourth character in the string.

State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 8, `row` is a string with at least 4 characters, and `i` is the fourth character in `row`.**
