Output State: **`nRow` is a string that represents the original `row` string with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1'. The variable `i` will represent each character in `row` during the loop execution. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string. If `row` contains characters other than '9', `nRow` will be updated to include those characters as they are.**
