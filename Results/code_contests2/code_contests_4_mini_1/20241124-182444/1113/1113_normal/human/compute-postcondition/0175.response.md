The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take user input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string representing the original row string with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.**
