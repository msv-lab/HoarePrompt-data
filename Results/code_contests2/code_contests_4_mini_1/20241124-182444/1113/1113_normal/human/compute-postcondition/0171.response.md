According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is the original string concatenated with the next character in `row` followed by '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise it includes the character `i`. Since `row` has at least one more character, we can conclude that there is at least one more character in `row` for the loop to execute again.

Since `row` has at least one more character, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that the next character `i` is the next character in `row` after the current iteration. The index of `i` in `row` will need to be incremented by one.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `nRow` to account for the next character in `row`, and `i` will be the next character.

State: **`nRow` is the original string concatenated with the next character in `row`, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `row` has at least one more character.**
