The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, which means that the string '1' is appended to the existing value of `nRow`. However, the initial value of `nRow` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its previous value or the new value after the operation. The other variables `res`, `T`, `row`, and `i` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 8, `row` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by appending '1' to its previous value.**
