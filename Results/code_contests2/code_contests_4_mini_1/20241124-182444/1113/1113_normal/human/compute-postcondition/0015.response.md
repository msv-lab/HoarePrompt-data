The variable `nRow` is being incremented by the value of `i`. However, since the initial value of `nRow` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact state after the increment. The variable `i` is not equal to '9', but its specific value is also unknown. The other variables (`t`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, and `row`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `nRow` is incremented by `i`, but we cannot specify exact values.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string; `nRow` is incremented by `i`.**
