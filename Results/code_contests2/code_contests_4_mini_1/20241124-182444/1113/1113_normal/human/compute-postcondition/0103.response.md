Postcondition: ***`res` is updated to include `nRow`, which is modified based on the second character `i` of the non-empty string `row`. If `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i`, ensuring that `nRow` always reflects a valid change based on the value of the second character in `row`.***
