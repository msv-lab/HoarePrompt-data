According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`, which is a non-empty string. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of `row`. 

If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is set to '1'. However, since `i` is the first character of `row`, it indicates that the loop will execute for each character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` will be '1' in the next iteration, and the loop will still be able to execute for the next character in `row`. 

The loop will continue executing until all characters in `row` have been processed. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is set to the next character in `row`, which would be the second character of `row`.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is '1' (if the first character was '9') or the value of the first character (if it was not '9')**
