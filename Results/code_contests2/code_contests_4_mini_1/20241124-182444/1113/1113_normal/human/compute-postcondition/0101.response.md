The variable `nRow` is updated by appending the character '1' to its existing value. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it will now include the character '1' at the end. The values of the other variables (`res`, `row`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'**
