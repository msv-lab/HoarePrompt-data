According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the contents of `row`. The loop iterates over each character (or element) in `row`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a character from `row`, and since `row` is non-empty, `row` must contain at least one more character for the loop to execute again. If `i` is '9', `nRow` becomes '1'; otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least one more character after the current `i`. 

Therefore, if we assume `i` was the last character of `row`, then `row` must have at least one additional character. If `nRow` was updated based on `i`, it doesn't affect the ability for the loop to continue; we only need to ensure `row` has more elements.

State: **`nRow` is updated based on `i`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character**
