The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to it. Since `nRow` is a string that can either be '1' (if `i` is '9') or the string representation of the next character in `row`, the new value of `nRow` will be either '11' (if `nRow` was '1') or the string representation of the next character in `row` followed by '1'. Therefore, the output state is dependent on the initial value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '11' or the string representation of the next character in `row` followed by '1'**
