The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `'1'` concatenated to its previous value. However, the initial value of `nRow` is not provided in the initial state, so we don't know its previous state. Therefore, the output state will mention that `nRow` is being modified but will not specify its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `row` has at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` has '1' concatenated to its previous value.**
