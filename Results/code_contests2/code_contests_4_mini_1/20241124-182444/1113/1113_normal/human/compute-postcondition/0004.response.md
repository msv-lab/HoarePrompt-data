The variable `maxint` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new assignment.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `maxint` is positive infinity**
