Output State: **`nRow` will be the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', while all other characters from `row` are retained in their original order. If `row` has at least one character, the loop will execute for each character in `row`, and `nRow` will reflect the modifications accordingly. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string. Therefore, if `row` is empty, `nRow` is an empty string, else `nRow` contains the modified string with '9's replaced by '1's.**
