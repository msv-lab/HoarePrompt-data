The code appends the character '1' to the string `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it will now include the additional character. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` has at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is now updated to include '1'.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` has at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is updated to include '1'**
