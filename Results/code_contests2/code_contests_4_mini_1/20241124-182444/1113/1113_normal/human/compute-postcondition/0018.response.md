The variable `nRow` is being appended with the string '1'. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`, so we cannot determine its previous value or the resultant value after concatenation. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` has been updated by appending '1', but its previous value is unknown.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `row` has at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in `row`, and `nRow` has been updated by appending '1'.**
