Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings formed by replacing every '9' in each input `row` with '1'. If a `row` is an empty string, `res` will contain an empty string. If the loop does not execute (which can occur if the range is adjusted to 0 or negative), `res` remains an empty list.**
