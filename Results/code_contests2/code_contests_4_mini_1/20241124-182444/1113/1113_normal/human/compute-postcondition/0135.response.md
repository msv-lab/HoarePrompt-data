The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it is set to a string input from the user after removing any leading and trailing whitespace. The values of `res`, `T`, and `i` remain unaffected as this operation only impacts the variable `row`. Therefore, the output state is: `res` will contain 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 8, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string (after stripping whitespace).

Output State: **`res` will contain 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 8, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string (after stripping whitespace)**.
