According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more characters in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`, which means that `i` has already been assigned a value from `row`. 

To determine the state adjustments needed:
- Since `row` remains a non-empty string with at least 8 characters, and `i` is the next character in `row`, we need to ensure that `row` still has characters left for the loop to execute one more time.
- If `i` is currently the next character, we can conclude that the next character in `row` is available for `i` in the next iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least one more character after the current `i`. This means that after the current character `i`, there should be more characters left in `row`. 

Thus, if `row` had at least 9 characters at the start of this iteration, it will still have at least 8 characters left after this iteration. 

State: **`nRow` is a string representation of either '811' or '891' if `i` is '9', or '81' + `i` or '89' + `i` if `i` is any other character, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 9 characters, and `i` is the next character in `row`.**
