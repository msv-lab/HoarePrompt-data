The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`, where `nRow` is the original string concatenated with the next character in `row` followed by '1'. The previous value of `nRow` will now include the value of `i`, but since we do not know the specific values of `i` or `row`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `nRow`. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is the original string concatenated with the next character in `row` followed by '1' and then incremented by `i`.

Output State: **`nRow` is the original string concatenated with the next character in `row` followed by '1' and then incremented by `i`**
