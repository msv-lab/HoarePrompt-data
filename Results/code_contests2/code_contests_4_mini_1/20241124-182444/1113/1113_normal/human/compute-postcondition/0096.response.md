The value of `nRow` is updated to include '1', resulting in `nRow` now containing '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty input string, and `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty input string, and `nRow` is '1'**
