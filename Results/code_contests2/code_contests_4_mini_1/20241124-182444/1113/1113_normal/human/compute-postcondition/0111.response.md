According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to 8 (inclusive), meaning it will execute 9 times in total. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than 9.

Since the end of the previous iteration isn't specified for `i`, we can infer that it must be 8, as `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8, which is the last valid index for this loop before it stops.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 9. No other states need to be adjusted as the other variables are not part of the loop control.

State: **`nRow` reflects the modified version of `row` where every occurrence of '9' is replaced with '1', `res` now contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is 9**
