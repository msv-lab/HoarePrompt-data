The code appends the character '1' to the string `nRow`. The value of `nRow` is updated to include this new character, but the values of the other variables (`res`, `t`, `T`, and `row`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 8, `T` is greater than 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, and `nRow` is updated to include the character '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 8, `T` is greater than 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'**
