According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length and content of the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. Since `row` remains a non-empty string with at least 11 characters at the end of the last iteration, it is guaranteed that there are still characters left to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be pointing to the last character processed in the string. If the length of `row` is `L`, then `i` will be equal to `row[L-1]` (the last character), and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be equal to `row[L]` (the next character).

Thus, the index `i` should be incremented to point to the next character in `row`, which will be the character at position `L` if `row` has more than `L` characters (which it does since it has at least 11 characters).

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `row` remains a non-empty string with at least 11 characters (no change needed).
- `i` should be updated to the next character in `row`.

Since the loop iterates character by character, if the last character processed was 'X', where 'X' is the character at `row[L-1]`, `i` should now point to the character at `row[L]`.

State: **`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 11 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`**
