The variable `row` is assigned the value `input().strip()`, which accepts an input string and removes any surrounding whitespace. The previous value of `nRow` is not directly affected by this assignment, but its definition is based on `row`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 9. Therefore, the output state reflects that `row` is now an input string, while `nRow` continues to be the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', and `i` remains 9.

Output State: **`row` is an input string; `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'; `i` is 9**
