The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous state of `res` containing `nRow` is not affected directly by this assignment, but `nRow` is now an empty string. The other variables `i` and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the current values of all variables.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string**
