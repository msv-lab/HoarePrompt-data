The code snippet `nRow += '1'` appends '1' to the current value of `nRow`. The initial state defines `nRow` as the first character of `row` concatenated with either '1' (if the first character was '9') or the third character `i` (if the first character was not '9'). Since the value of `nRow` changes due to the concatenation, the output state will reflect the updated value of `nRow`. Other variables `row` and `i` are not affected.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character of `row`, `nRow` is the first character of `row` concatenated with either '1' or `i`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1' at the end.**
