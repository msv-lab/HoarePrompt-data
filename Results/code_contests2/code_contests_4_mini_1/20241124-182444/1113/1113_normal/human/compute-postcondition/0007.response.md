According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. The loop will execute `T` times if `T` is at least 1. Since `t` is a positive integer and is used as the loop variable, its initial value will be 0 at the start of the loop, which is the first iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `T` must be greater than 0. 

State: **`t` is 0, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0**
