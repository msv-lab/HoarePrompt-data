The variable `nRow` is updated to include the value of `i`, which is the second character of the string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` has a valid character value. The previous value of `nRow` is updated by appending `i` to it. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow` and the unchanged values of `row` and `i`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include `i`.**
