Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, which is a string that replaces every '9' in `row` with '1', while other characters remain unchanged. If `row` is an empty string, `nRow` remains empty; if `row` contains only '9's, `nRow` will be a string of '1's; if `row` contains no '9's, `nRow` will be identical to `row`.**
