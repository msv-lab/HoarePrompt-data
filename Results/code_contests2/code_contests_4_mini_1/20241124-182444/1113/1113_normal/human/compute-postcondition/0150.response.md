Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 8, `row` is a string with at least 3 characters, and `i` is the third character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is increased by appending '1' to its previous value; otherwise, `nRow` is increased by appending the value of `i` to its previous value.***
