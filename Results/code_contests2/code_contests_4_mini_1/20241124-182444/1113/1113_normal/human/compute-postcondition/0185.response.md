The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous value of `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`. The variable `row` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow` based on the addition.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `row` remains a non-empty string with at least 11 characters**
