The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating it with the value of `i`. Since `nRow` is a string and `i` is the next character in `row`, the output state depends on the specific values of these variables. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` will become '1' + '9' = '19'. If `i` is any other character, `nRow` will be the original value of `nRow` concatenated with `i`. The other variable `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the potential outcomes based on the conditions provided.

Output State: **`nRow` is the string that is either '19' if `i` is '9', or the string representation of the original `nRow` concatenated with `i`; `i` is the next character in `row`.**
