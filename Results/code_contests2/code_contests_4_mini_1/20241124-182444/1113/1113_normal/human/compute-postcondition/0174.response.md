According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will run for `i` values from 0 to 8 (inclusive), which means it will execute a total of 9 times. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be 8 for it to complete its final iteration.

To execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to 9, which is outside the range specified in the loop statement (0 to 8). Therefore, the loop cannot execute again, as it will not satisfy the condition `i < 9`.

Since there are no other states that need to be adjusted, the final state remains unchanged.

State: **`nRow` is a string representing the original row string with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is 9**
