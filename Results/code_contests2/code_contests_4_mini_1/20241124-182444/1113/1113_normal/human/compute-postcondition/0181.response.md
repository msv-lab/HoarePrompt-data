The value of `nRow` is updated by appending `i` to it. Since `nRow` starts as an empty string (`''`) and `i` is `9`, the new value of `nRow` becomes `'9'`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '9', `res` is updated to include the original row string, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 10 characters.

Output State: **`nRow` is '9', `res` is updated to include the original row string, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 10 characters**
