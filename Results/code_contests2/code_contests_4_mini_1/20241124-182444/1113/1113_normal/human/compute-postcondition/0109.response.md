Output State: **If `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` will contain a modified version of `row` where every occurrence of '9' is replaced with '1', and all other characters remain unchanged. The final value of `nRow` will reflect all transformations based on the characters in `row`. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string.**
