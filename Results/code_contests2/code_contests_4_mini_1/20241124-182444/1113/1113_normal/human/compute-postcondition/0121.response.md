The `nRow` variable is updated by appending the string '1' to it. The previous value of `nRow` is not explicitly stated, but it is updated based on `i`, and it is assumed to hold a string value. The `row` variable is a non-empty string with at least one more character, but it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character.**
