The code modifies `nRow` by appending the character '1' to its current value. Since `nRow` is initially defined as the original string concatenated with the next character in `row`, the new value of `nRow` will be the original string with the next character from `row` followed by '1'. The state of `row` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`nRow` is the original string concatenated with the next character in `row` followed by '1', `row` has at least one more character; now `nRow` is updated to the original string concatenated with the next character in `row` followed by '1'**
