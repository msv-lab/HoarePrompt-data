The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string `'1'` to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will hold the value `'1'`. The values of the other variables `i` and `row` are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nRow`.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `i` is 8, `row` is a non-empty string**
