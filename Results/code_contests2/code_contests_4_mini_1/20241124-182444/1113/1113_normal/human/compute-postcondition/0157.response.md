According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will iterate over its characters. The `i` variable is already set to 9, which does not affect the loop's execution since `i` will be reassigned to each character in `row` during the loop. However, since `nRow` is an empty string, it does not play a role in the loop execution. 

For the loop to execute, `row` must be a non-empty string. Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state are that `row` must be a non-empty string, and `i` is initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string**
