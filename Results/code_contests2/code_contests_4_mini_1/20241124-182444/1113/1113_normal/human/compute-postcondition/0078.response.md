The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to the string `nRow`. Since `i` is 0, it will be added to `nRow`, which is currently an empty string. Thus, `nRow` will become "0". The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 8, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is "0"**
