The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the string '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the operation, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unaffected as they are not involved in this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '1', `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string**
