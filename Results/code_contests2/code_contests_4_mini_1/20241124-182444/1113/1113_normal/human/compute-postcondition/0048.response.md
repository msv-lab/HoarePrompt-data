According to the code, the loop is configured to run for `i` in the range of 9, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still within the loop's range. Since the loop has not yet reached its termination point, the next value of `i` will be 9, which will cause the loop to terminate.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the value of `i` to be less than 9. Therefore, we can set `i` to 8, which is the last valid index for the loop to execute.

No other states need to be adjusted since `nRow`, `row`, and `res` do not influence the loop's execution in this case.

State: **`nRow` is the result of replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'; if `row` is a non-empty string, then `res` is appended with the transformed string. If `row` is an empty string, then `res` is appended with an empty string, `i` is 8**
