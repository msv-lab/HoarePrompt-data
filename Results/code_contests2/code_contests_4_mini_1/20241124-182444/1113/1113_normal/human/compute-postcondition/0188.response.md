The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string `'1'` to it. Since `nRow` was previously updated based on the value of `i`, it retains its previous value but now includes an additional `'1'` at the end. The `row` and `i` variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow`, while `row` and `i` maintain their prior states.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated by appending '1', `row` is a non-empty string with at least 11 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`**
