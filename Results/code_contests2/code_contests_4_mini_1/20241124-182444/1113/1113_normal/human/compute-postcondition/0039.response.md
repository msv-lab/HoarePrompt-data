The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to `nRow`. Given the initial state, `nRow` is either '1' (if the first character of `row` was '9') or the value of the first character of `row`. The value of `i` is the second character of `row`, which will be appended to `nRow`.

If `row` is a non-empty string, `i` will have a specific character value that is the second character of the string. Therefore, the new value of `nRow` will be the original value of `nRow` followed by the character in `i`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `nRow` and the unchanged values of `row` and `i`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is the first character of `row` followed by the second character of `row`**
