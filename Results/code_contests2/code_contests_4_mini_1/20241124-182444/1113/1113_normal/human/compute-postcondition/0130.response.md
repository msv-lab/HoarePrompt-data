The code appends `nRow` to the list `res`. The value of `nRow` is derived from the string `row` with every '9' replaced by '1'. If `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` will contain characters from `row` with the specified replacement, and `res` will be updated to include this new value. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string, and `res` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state takes into account the previous value of `nRow` and the effect of the append operation on `res`.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string with '9' replaced by '1'; `res` contains the updated value of `nRow` appended to it.**
