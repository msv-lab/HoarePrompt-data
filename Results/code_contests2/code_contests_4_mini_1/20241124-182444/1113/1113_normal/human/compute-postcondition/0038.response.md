The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of its previous state plus the string '1'. The initial value of `nRow` is either '1' (if the first character of `row` was '9') or the value of the first character of `row`. After the execution of the code, `nRow` will have '1' appended to its previous value. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is either '1' or the value of the first character of `row` concatenated with '1'**
