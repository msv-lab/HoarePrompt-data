The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the character '1' to it. The previous value of `nRow` is not explicitly defined, but it has been updated based on `i`. The other variables `row` and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state indicates that `nRow` has been updated accordingly.

Output State: **`nRow` has been updated to include '1', `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`**
