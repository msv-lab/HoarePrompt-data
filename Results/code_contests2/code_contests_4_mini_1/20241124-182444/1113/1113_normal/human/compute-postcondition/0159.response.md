The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is an empty string, the new value of `nRow` becomes `'1'`. The values of the other variables, `i` and `row`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '1', `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string**
