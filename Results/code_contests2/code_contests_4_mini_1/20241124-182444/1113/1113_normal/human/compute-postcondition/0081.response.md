The variable `nRow` is updated by concatenating the string '1' to its current value. Since the initial state does not provide the specific value of `nRow`, but states it is updated based on the new value of `i`, we conclude that `nRow` will now represent its previous value plus '1'.

The states of the other variables (`res`, `t`, `T`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 8, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is the next character in the non-empty string `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and `nRow` is updated to its previous value plus '1'.**
