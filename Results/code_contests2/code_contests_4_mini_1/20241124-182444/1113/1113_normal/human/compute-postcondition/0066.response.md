Output State: **`nRow` is a string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute for each character in `row`, and `nRow` will contain the modified string after all characters have been processed. If `row` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string.**
