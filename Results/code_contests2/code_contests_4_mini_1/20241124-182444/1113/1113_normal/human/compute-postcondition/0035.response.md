The variable `nRow` is updated by concatenating the current value of `nRow` (which is an empty string) with the current value of `i` (which is the first character of `row` and not equal to '9'). Therefore, `nRow` will take the value of `i`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Thus, the output state is: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
