Functionality: ** The function reads an integer T from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes 9 lines of input, replacing every occurrence of '9' in each line with '1' and storing the modified lines in a list. After processing, it writes the results as a single output with each modified row separated by new lines. If T is 0 or negative, no rows are processed, and the output will be empty. Additionally, if any input row is empty, the corresponding output will also be an empty string. **
