According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `i`. The loop is set to iterate for `i` in the range of 9, meaning it will execute while `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must have reached 8 (the last value in the range before 9). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9. This means that `i` should be adjusted to 9, which will cause the loop condition to fail, and the loop will not execute again. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `nRow` and `res` are based on the operations performed within the loop body, which is omitted, and their values will not affect the loop's ability to execute one more time in this case.

State: **`nRow` will be the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'; if `row` is empty, `nRow` is an empty string; `res` will have `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9**
