The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Initially, `nRow` is an empty string. After executing the code, `nRow` becomes '1'. The variable `row` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', and the first character of `row` is '9'.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', and the first character of `row` is '9'**
