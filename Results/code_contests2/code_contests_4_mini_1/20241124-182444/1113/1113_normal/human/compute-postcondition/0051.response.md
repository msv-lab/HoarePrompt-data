According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over the characters in the string `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one character. The initial state indicates that `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 8 (which is irrelevant since `i` will be reassigned in the loop), and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `row` is not empty and can consist of at least one character. Therefore, we will adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`nRow` is '', `i` is 8, `row` is a non-empty string**
