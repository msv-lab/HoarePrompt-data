The variable `nRow` is initialized as an empty string. The previous state indicates that `nRow` will be formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', but since `nRow` is explicitly set to an empty string, it currently holds that value. The values of `i` and `row` are not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state.

Output State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9, `row` is an input string**
