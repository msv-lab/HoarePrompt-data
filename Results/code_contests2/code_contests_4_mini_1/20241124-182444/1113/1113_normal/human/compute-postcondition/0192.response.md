Output State: **`nRow` is the result of replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', while all other characters in `row` are appended unchanged. `res` includes the original row string, and `row` remains a non-empty string. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string.**
