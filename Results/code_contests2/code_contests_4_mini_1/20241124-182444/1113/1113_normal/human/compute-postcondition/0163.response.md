According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to take on the next character in `row`.

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` corresponds to the last character of the string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, we need to determine what the next character will be. If `i` is the last character in `row`, the loop will not execute again.

Thus, we can conclude:
- If `i` is '9', then `nRow` should be updated to '1' for the next iteration.
- If `i` is anything other than '9', then `nRow` should be updated to the string representation of the next character in `row`.

Since the exact character that `i` corresponds to at the end of the last iteration is not specified, we cannot determine the specific next state for `nRow` or `i` without making assumptions about `row`.

However, we can definitively state that:
- `i` must be updated to reflect the next character in the string `row`, and thus the length of `row` must be greater than the current position of `i`.

State: **`nRow` is a string that will either be '1' if `i` is '9', or the string representation of the next character in `row`, `i` is the next character in `row`.**
