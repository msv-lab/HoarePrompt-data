Output State: **`nRow` is the result of replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'; if `row` is a non-empty string, then `res` is appended with the transformed string. If `row` is an empty string, then `res` is appended with an empty string, `i` is 8, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.**
