According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will execute again if `row` contains more characters for the variable `i` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `row` remains a non-empty string with at least 10 characters, which means it can still support further iterations. The variable `i` would be assigned the next character from `row` during the next iteration. 

To execute the loop one more time, `row` must still have at least one more character remaining. Therefore, if `row` has at least 11 characters at the end of the last iteration, it will continue to execute. The value of `nRow` does not need to change since it is dependent on `i`, and the conditions regarding the original row string and non-empty state of `row` remain satisfied.

State: **`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `row` remains a non-empty string with at least 11 characters**
