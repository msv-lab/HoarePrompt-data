The variable `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to it. Since `row` has at least 2 characters, `i` is defined as the second character of `row`. The specific value of `i` depends on the content of `row`, but since it is a character, `nRow` will include this character as well. The previous value of `nRow` is updated, but we do not know its initial value. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nRow` and retains the other variable states:

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` has at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i`**
