According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to '8', which means that the loop has already processed the characters in `row` up to '8'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least one more character after '8'. Since `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, and since `i` is equal to '8', `nRow` would have been updated to '8' before the last iteration. However, since `i` was '8' at the end of the previous iteration, `nRow` is not updated to '1' (which only happens if `i` is '9').

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need `row` to contain at least one more character, which means it must have at least one more character beyond what has already been processed (which is '8'). 

Hence, the necessary adjustment would be for `row` to contain at least 9 characters, and `i` should be updated to the next character in `row`, which is expected to be '9' for the last character processed in the next iteration.

State: **`nRow` is a string representation of '8', `row` is a non-empty string with at least 9 characters, `i` is '9'**
