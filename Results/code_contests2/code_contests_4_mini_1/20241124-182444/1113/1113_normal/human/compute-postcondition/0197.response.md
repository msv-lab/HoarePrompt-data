Output State: **`res` will contain `T * 9` strings where each string is formed by replacing every '9' in the corresponding input `row` with '1'. If any `row` input is empty, the corresponding `nRow` will be an empty string, and `res` will include an empty string. If `T` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty list. If `T` is greater than 0, `res` will contain `T * 9` modified strings.**
