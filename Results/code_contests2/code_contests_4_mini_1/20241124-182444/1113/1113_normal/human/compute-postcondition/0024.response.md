Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `row` has at least 3 characters, and `i` is the third character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` has '1' concatenated to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is assigned the value of `i`.***
