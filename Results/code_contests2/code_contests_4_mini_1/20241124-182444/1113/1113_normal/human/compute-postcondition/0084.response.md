According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character than it did at the end of the last iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and thus it currently contains at least one character available for iteration.

Given that `i` is iterating over characters in `row`, if `row` contains at least one more character than before, this will allow the loop to execute one more time. Since `row` is non-empty, we need to ensure that it still has characters left to iterate over.

To adjust the states accordingly:
- The string `row` should have at least one more character than it did at the end of the last iteration. This means that `row` will still be a non-empty string, but we need to ensure it reflects having at least one more character.
- The character `i` will need to be the next character in the `row` string.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 8, `T` is greater than 9, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters. If `i` is the second character in the string, then `nRow` is updated to include the next character `i`.**
