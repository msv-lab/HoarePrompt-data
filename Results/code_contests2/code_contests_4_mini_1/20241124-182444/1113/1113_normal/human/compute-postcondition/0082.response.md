The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` to its current value. Since `i` is described as the next character in the non-empty string `row`, the previous value of `nRow` is affected by this concatenation. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow` along with the unchanged values of `res`, `t`, `T`, and `row`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 8, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is the next character in the non-empty string `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and `nRow` is updated to include the next character `i`.**
