The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i` to it. Since `i` is defined as the next character in the non-empty string `row`, `nRow` will be extended by one character. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is updated by appending `i`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 11 characters, and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated by appending `i`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 11 characters, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
