Output State: **`res` will contain 9 modified strings where each '9' in each input `row` is replaced with '1', while other characters remain unchanged. If the input `row` is empty, `nRow` will be an empty string and `res` will include an empty string; if `row` contains only '9's, `nRow` will be a string of '1's of the same length; if `row` contains no '9's, `nRow` will be identical to `row`. If the loop does not execute (for example, if there are fewer than 9 iterations due to an exception), `res` will remain unchanged and will still contain the original 9 strings.**
