The statement `nRow = ''` assigns an empty string to `nRow`, which means that `nRow` will now contain no characters. The previous value of `nRow` was the original string with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', but now it is reset. The other variables `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nRow` is '', `res` is updated to include the original row string, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.**
