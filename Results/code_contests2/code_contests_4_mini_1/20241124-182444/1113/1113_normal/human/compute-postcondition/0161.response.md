The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the current value of `i` to it. Since `i` is 0, `nRow` will become "0". Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is "0", `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is "0", `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
