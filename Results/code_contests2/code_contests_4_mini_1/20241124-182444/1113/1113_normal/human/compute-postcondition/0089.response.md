Output State: **`nRow` will be a string that replaces every '9' in `row` with '1', while other characters remain unchanged. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `nRow` remains an empty string. If `row` contains only '9's, `nRow` will be a string of '1's corresponding to the number of '9's in `row`. If `row` contains no '9's, `nRow` will be identical to `row`.**
