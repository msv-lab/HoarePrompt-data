According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 8 or less. 

Given that the loop runs with `i` starting from 0 up to 8, if the last iteration of the loop has been completed, `i` would be incremented after the last execution. Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, `i` would be 9, which means it has reached the limit of the loop and cannot execute again.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 8. The states of `nRow` and `res` do not need to be adjusted as they are not directly affected by the loop's execution condition.

State: **`nRow` is the transformed version of `row`; `res` includes the original `row` and `nRow`, `i` is 8**
