Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 8, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is a string that can either be '9' or '0', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated to '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is updated to the string representation of `i`, which is '0' when `i` is 0.***
