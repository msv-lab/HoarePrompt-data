Postcondition: ***`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i` which is the next character in `row`, a non-empty string with at least 11 characters. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, `i` is appended to `nRow`. Therefore, `nRow` is either `nRow` concatenated with '1' if `i` is '9', or `nRow` concatenated with the character `i` if it is any character other than '9'.***
