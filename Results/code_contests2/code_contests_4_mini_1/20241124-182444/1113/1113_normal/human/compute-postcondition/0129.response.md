Output State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the characters from `row` with every '9' replaced by '1'. `res` contains the updated value of `nRow`. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute for each character in `row`. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, leaving `nRow` as an empty string and `res` unchanged.**
