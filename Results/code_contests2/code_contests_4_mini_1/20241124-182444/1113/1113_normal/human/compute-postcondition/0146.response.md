Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 8, and `row` is a string with at least 2 characters. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` will be updated to include '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` will be updated by concatenating the character `i` to it. Thus, `nRow` will either end with '1' or the value of `i`, depending on the value of `i`.***
