The variable `T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `T` will be a positive integer. Other variables (`t`, `maxint`, and `res`) are not affected, so the output state is `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` is an empty list; `T` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` is an empty list; `T` is an input integer**
