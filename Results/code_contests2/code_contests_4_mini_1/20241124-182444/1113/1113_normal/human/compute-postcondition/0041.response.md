According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. The loop will execute as long as there are more characters in `row` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character of `row`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `row`, which would be the third character. 

To determine the next state for `nRow`, we need to consider the first character of `row`:
- If the first character of `row` is '9', then `nRow` would need to be updated to the first character concatenated with '1'.
- If the first character is not '9', then `nRow` would need to be updated to the first character concatenated with the new value of `i`, which will now be the third character of `row`.

Since the task does not provide the actual content of `row`, we will state that `nRow` will depend on the first character of `row` and its effect on `nRow`. However, we can still adjust `i` for the next iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should now be the third character of `row`.
- `nRow` should be updated based on the first character of `row` and the newly assigned value of `i`.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is the first character of `row` concatenated with either '1' (if the first character was '9') or the third character `i` (if the first character was not '9').**
