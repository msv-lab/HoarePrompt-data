According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `row` has at least 2 characters, and `i` is the second character of `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least 3 characters, and `i` must be the third character of `row`. The state of `nRow` will be adjusted based on the value of `i` in the next iteration, but since it is not specified what `i` will be, we can only ensure that `row` has the required length and adjust `i` accordingly.

State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` has at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`**
