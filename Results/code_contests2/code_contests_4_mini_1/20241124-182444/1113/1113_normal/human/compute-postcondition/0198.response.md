The `write` function outputs the joined strings from the `res` list, separated by newline characters. The content of `res` is determined by the previous logic involving `T`, where if `T` is greater than 0, `res` contains `T * 9` strings with '9' replaced by '1'. If `T` is 0 or negative, `res` would be an empty list.

Assuming `T` is greater than 0, the output will be the joined strings from `res`, while if `T` is 0 or negative, there will be no output. 

Since the exact value of `res` isn't provided, I will focus on the conditions stated.

Output State: **`res` contains the modified strings based on the input rows if `T` is greater than 0; otherwise, `res` is an empty list, resulting in no output.**
