The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This assignment does not impact any of the other variables, which maintain their previous values. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 8, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 8, `T` is greater than 9, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string, and `nRow` is an empty string**
