The variable `res` is initialized as an empty list. There are no changes to the values of `t` or `maxint`, as they remain as defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `res` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` is an empty list**
