The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The other variables `t`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string, and `nRow` is an empty string**
