The value of `i` is the first character of the input string, which is either '0' or '1'. The expression `i == '1'` evaluates to `True` if `i` is '1' and `False` if `i` is '0'. In Python, `True` is equivalent to 1 and `False` is equivalent to 0. The value of `pa` is incremented by this evaluation.

If `i` is '1', then `pa` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`. If `i` is '0', then `pa` remains `0 + 0 = 0`.

Therefore, the output state is: 
`a` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', `b` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', `pa` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first character of the input string.

Output State: **`a` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', `b` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', `pa` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first character of the input string**
