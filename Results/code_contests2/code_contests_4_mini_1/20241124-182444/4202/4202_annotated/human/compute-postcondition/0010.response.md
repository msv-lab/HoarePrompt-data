According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `raw_input()`. The loop will execute if there is at least one character in the input string. If the input is empty, the loop will not execute, and `i` will not be defined. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input string is not empty for the loop to run. 

To ensure this, we can state that `a` must be a non-empty string, which will also ensure that `pa` is at least 0 (but it can be greater if there are '1's in `a`). 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `a` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1'
- `b` remains as is
- `pb` remains 0
- `i` will be the first character of the input string from `raw_input()`

State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in a non-empty string `a`, `a` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `b` is a string of '0' and '1', `pb` is 0, `i` is the first character of `a`**
