According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the non-empty string obtained from `raw_input()`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character in the input string that has not been processed yet. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of a non-empty string. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be updated to the next character in the string. The condition that `a` is a non-empty string ensures that there are more characters possible for `i` to take.

Since `pb` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `i`, it does not affect the iteration of the loop directly. However, we need to ensure that `i` reflects the next character in the input string.

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the state at the start of the next iteration are:
- `i` should be updated to the next character in the string after the first character that was processed.
- `b` should be considered as the remaining part of the input string to maintain context, but is not directly affected by the loop iteration.

State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in a non-empty string `a`, `a` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `b` is a string of '0' and '1', `pb` is either 2 or 3 depending on the next value of `i`, `i` is the next character in the string**
