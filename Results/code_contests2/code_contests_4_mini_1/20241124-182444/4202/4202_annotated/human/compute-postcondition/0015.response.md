The variable `pb` is updated by incrementing it by 1 if the condition `i == '1'` is true; otherwise, it remains unchanged. The value of `pb` can either be 1 or 2 depending on the initial value. The value of `i` being the first character of a non-empty string can be either '0' or '1'. 

If `i` is '1', then `pb` will increase by 1. If `i` is '0', then `pb` remains the same. Therefore, the possible new values of `pb` could be either 2 or 3 (if it started as 1) or remain as 2 or 3 (if it started as 2).

Thus, the output state reflects the current values of `pa`, `a`, `b`, and the updated value of `pb` based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in a non-empty string `a`, `a` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `b` is a string of '0' and '1', `pb` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `i`, and `i` is the first character of a non-empty string**.
