According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input string provided by `raw_input()`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` is set to the first character of the next input. To determine whether the loop can execute again, we need to consider what happens with `i` in the context of the next input string.

The loop will continue as long as there are more characters in the input string. Since `i` represents the first character of the next input, we need to ensure that the input string has at least one character remaining for the loop to execute again. This means we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is at least one character left in the next input.

Thus, we need to modify the states as follows:

- `a` remains a non-empty string of '0' and '1', but we need to ensure that after the previous character read, there is at least one character left for further iteration.
- `pb` must also remain consistent with the new input string.

Since the value of `i` is the first character of the new input, we do not need to change its value, but we need to ensure that it indicates the first character of a non-empty input for the next iteration.

State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in a non-empty string `a`, `a` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `b` is a string of '0' and '1', `pb` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `i`, and `i` is the first character of a non-empty string**
