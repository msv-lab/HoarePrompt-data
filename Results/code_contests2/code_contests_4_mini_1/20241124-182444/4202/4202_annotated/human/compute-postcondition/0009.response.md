The variable `pb` is assigned the value `0`, which means `pb` is now `0`. The values of the other variables `pa`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string; if the input is empty, `pa` remains 0; `a` is a string consisting of '0' and '1'; `b` is a string consisting of '0' and '1'; `pb` is 0.
