To analyze the loop in the provided code, we need to consider the input and how the variable `pa` is updated based on the characters read from the input.

The loop processes input character by character, incrementing `pa` each time it encounters '1'. 

1. If the input consists only of '0's, `pa` will remain 0.
2. If the input consists only of '1's, `pa` will equal the length of the input after the loop completes.
3. If the input contains a mixture of '0's and '1's, `pa` will be incremented for each '1' found.

Additionally, we need to consider cases where the loop might not execute:
- If there is no input provided (an empty string), the loop does not execute at all, and `pa` remains 0.

Based on these analyses, the output state after the loop executes is determined by the input string read through `raw_input()`.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string; if the input is empty, `pa` remains 0. `a` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', `b` is a string consisting of '0' and '1'.**
