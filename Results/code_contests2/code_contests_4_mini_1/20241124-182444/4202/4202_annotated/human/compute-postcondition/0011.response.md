The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The previous value of `pb` is 0. The value of `i` is the first character of the string `a`, which can be either '0' or '1'. Therefore, if `i` is '1', `pb` will become 1; if `i` is '0', `pb` will remain 0. The output state reflects the possible values of `pb` based on the value of `i`. 

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in a non-empty string `a`, `a` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `b` is a string of '0' and '1', `pb` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first character of `a`**
