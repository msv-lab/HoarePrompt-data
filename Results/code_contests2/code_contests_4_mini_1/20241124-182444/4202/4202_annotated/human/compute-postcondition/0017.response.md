Output State: **`pb` is the count of '1's in the input string read from raw_input(). If the input string is empty, the loop does not execute, and `pb` remains 0. `pa` is the count of '1's in the string `a`, which remains unchanged. `a` is a string consisting of '0' and '1'; `b` is a string of '0' and '1'.**
