According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the input provided by `raw_input()`. Since `i` will be assigned each character from the input string, the loop will execute as long as there is at least one character in the input string. The states to be adjusted are related to the input and the variable `i`.

1. `a` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', which does not affect the loop execution.
2. `b` is also a string consisting of '0' and '1', which similarly does not affect the loop execution.
3. `pa` is 0 and doesn't influence the loop execution either.

For the loop to execute, `raw_input()` must return a non-empty string. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input string has at least one character. Additionally, `i` will be the first character of the input string.

State: **`a` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', `b` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', `pa` is 0, `i` is the first character of the input string (which is not empty)**
