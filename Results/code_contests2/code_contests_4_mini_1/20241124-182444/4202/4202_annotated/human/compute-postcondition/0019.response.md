The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are strings consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', and their lengths are between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The function does not specify its output in the provided information, so the exact return value is unknown. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two binary strings `a` and `b`, which are constrained to consist of '0' and '1' and have lengths between 1 and 1000. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, which are binary strings consisting of '0' and '1', and their lengths are between 1 and 1000 inclusive.**
