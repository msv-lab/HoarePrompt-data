The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the condition `i == '1'` is true, meaning if the first character of the next input is '1', `pb` will be either 1 or 2 depending on its previous value (which is either 0 or 1). The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `pa` is the count of '1's in the string `a`, `a` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `b` is a string of '0' and '1', `pb` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `i`, and `i` is the first character of the next input.
