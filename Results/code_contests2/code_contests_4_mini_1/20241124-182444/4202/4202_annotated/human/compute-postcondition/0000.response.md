The variable `pa` is assigned the value `0`. The initial states of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', `b` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', and `pa` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', `b` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', and `pa` is 0**
