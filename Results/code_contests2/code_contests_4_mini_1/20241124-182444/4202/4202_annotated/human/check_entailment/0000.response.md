Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if string `a` can be transformed into string `b` based on the specified operations. 

### Issues with the Code:
1. **Counting '1's Only**: The program only counts the number of '1's in both strings `a` and `b`, denoted as `pa` and `pb` respectively. However, the transformation requires more than just the number of '1's; it also depends on the presence of '0's and the structure of the strings themselves.

2. **Ignoring String Lengths**: The program does not consider the lengths of the strings. For example, if `a` has a length significantly greater than `b`, it may be impossible to transform `a` into `b` regardless of the counts of '1's.

3. **Output Logic is Flawed**: The expression `print['NO', 'YES'][pa >= pb]` is misleading. While it outputs "YES" when `pa` (the count of '1's in `a`) is greater than or equal to `pb` (the count of '1's in `b`), it does not account for the necessary operations or the actual string content.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
a = "0000"
b = "0001"
```
- For this input, `pa = 0` (no '1's in `a`) and `pb = 1` (one '1' in `b`).
- The program would output "NO" because `pa >= pb` is false. However, it is indeed impossible to transform `a` into `b` since there are no '1's in `a` to work with.

This shows that the program does not fulfill the requirement of the problem statement, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.

Thus, the final verdict is:
Correctness: **False**
