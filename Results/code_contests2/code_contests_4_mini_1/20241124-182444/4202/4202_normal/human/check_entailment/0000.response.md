To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it meets all the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

### Problem Description:
The task is to determine if it is possible to transform string `a` into string `b` using two operations:
1. Append the parity of string `a` to the end of `a`.
2. Remove the first character of `a`.

The parity of a 01-string is `1` if there is an odd number of `1`s in the string, and `0` otherwise.

### Provided Code:
```python
pa = 0
for i in raw_input():
    pa += i == '1'
pb = 0
for i in raw_input():
    pb += i == '1'
print['NO', 'YES'][pa >= pb]
```

### Output Hints:
The function counts the number of '1's in each input and prints 'YES' if the count in the first input is greater than or equal to that in the second input; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. It does not handle non-binary characters in the input.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code correctly counts the number of '1's in both strings `a` and `b`.
2. It checks if the count of '1's in `a` (denoted as `pa`) is greater than or equal to the count of '1's in `b` (denoted as `pb`).
3. It prints 'YES' if `pa >= pb`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Edge Cases:
1. The problem allows for the modification of `a` through appending the parity and removing characters. However, simply counting '1's does not capture the full essence of the transformation rules. 
2. For instance, if `a` is "0" and `b` is "1", the program will output 'NO' because `pa` (0) is less than `pb` (1). However, considering the operations, it is possible to transform "0" to "1" by appending the parity (which would be 0, since there are no '1's) initially, and the remaining operations would not yield the result.
3. Additionally, if `a` contains no '1's and `b` contains at least one '1', the output will incorrectly be 'NO', even though `a` can never become `b`.

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints suggest that the program does not handle non-binary characters, which is an additional edge case that should be considered. However, since the problem specifies that input strings only contain '0' and '1', this point is not as critical but does indicate a lack of robustness.

### Conclusion:
The code does not account for the functional requirements of transforming `a` into `b` based on the allowed operations. Specifically, it fails in cases where the transformation is possible but the count of '1's does not reflect that.

Correctness: **False**.
