The variable `pa` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state does not change any other variables, which are `a` and `b`, both of which remain as strings consisting only of the characters "0" and "1". Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a string of "0" and "1"; `b` is a string of "0" and "1"; `pa` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a string of "0" and "1"; `b` is a string of "0" and "1"; `pa` is 0**
