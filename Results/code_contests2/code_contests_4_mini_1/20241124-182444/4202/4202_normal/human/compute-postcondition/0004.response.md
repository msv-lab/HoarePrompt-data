The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the condition `i == '1'` is true. The value of `i` is the second character of the input string and can either be '0' or '1'. If `i` is '1', `pa` increases by 1; if `i` is '0', `pa` remains unchanged. The previous value of `pa` can be either 0 or 1.

Therefore, the possible scenarios are:
- If `i` is '1', `pa` will be incremented by 1.
- If `i` is '0', `pa` will remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state is: `a` is a string of "0" and "1", `b` is a string of "0" and "1", `pa` is either 0 or 1 (incremented if `i` is '1'), and `i` is the second character of the input string.

Output State: **`a` is a string of "0" and "1", `b` is a string of "0" and "1", `pa` is either 0 or 1 (incremented if `i` is '1'), `i` is the second character of the input string**
