The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is equal to '1'. Since `pa` is either 0 or 1, if `i` is '1', then `pa` becomes 1 (if it was 0) or 2 (if it was 1). If `i` is '0', `pa` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a string of "0" and "1", `b` is a string of "0" and "1", `pa` is either 1 or 2 (if `i` is '1') or remains the same (if `i` is '0'), `i` is the third character of the input string**
