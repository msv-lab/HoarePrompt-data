According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the input string `raw_input()`. The variable `i` represents the current character being processed in the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character available in the input string after the previous character.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character of the input string. This means that the loop has processed at least one character before it. In order for the loop to execute again, `i` should be the next character in the input string, which would be the third character. Additionally, `pa` should be updated to reflect the count of '1's in the input string up to the third character, and `pb` should be updated based on whether the third character is '1'.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to indicate that there are at least three characters in the input string, and `i` should be set to the third character of the input string.

State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string up to the third character, `i` is the third character of the input string, `pb` is either 0 or 1 based on the third character being '1'**
