The line `pb += i == '1'` increments `pb` by 1 if `i` is equal to '1' and by 0 if `i` is not equal to '1'. Given that `pb` starts at 0, the value of `pb` will either remain 0 or become 1 depending on whether `i` is '1' or not. The variable `pa` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state can be described based on the conditions of `i`.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the first character of the input string, `pb` is either 0 or 1**
