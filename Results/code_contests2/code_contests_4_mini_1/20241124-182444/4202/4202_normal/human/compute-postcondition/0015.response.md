The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. Since `pb` can either be 0 or 1 based on the previous state, the new value of `pb` will be determined by the value of `i`. If `i` is '1', `pb` will become 1 or 2; if `i` is not '1', `pb` will remain the same. Therefore, the output state reflects the possible values of `pb` based on whether `i` is '1' or not.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string up to the third character, `i` is the third character of the input string, `pb` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition that `i` is '1'**
