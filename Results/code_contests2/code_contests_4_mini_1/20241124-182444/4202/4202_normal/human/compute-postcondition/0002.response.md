The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The initial value of `pa` is 0. The value of `i` is the first character of the input string, which is not empty and can either be '0' or '1'. If `i` is '1', then `pa` becomes 1; if `i` is '0', then `pa` remains 0. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a string of "0" and "1", `b` is a string of "0" and "1", `pa` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is the first character of the input string.

Output State: **`a` is a string of "0" and "1", `b` is a string of "0" and "1", `pa` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first character of the input string**
