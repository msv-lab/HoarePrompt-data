The value of `pb` is assigned 0, and it does not depend on any previous values, as it is being set directly. The other variable `pa` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the current character being processed, and `pb` is 0.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the current character being processed, and `pb` is 0**
