Output State: **`pb` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pa` is the total count of '1's in the entire input string, `i` is the last character processed in the input string. If the input string is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `pa` and `pb` remain as initially defined (with `pb` as 0).**
