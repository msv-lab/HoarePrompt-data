The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Since `a` is a multiple of 10, the result of `a % 10` will be 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of dividing `a` by `b`, `copya` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged, `a` is a multiple of 10, and `h` is 0.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of dividing `a` by `b`, `copya` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged, `a` is a multiple of 10, and `h` is 0**
