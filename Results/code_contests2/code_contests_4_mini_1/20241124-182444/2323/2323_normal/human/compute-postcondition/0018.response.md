The operation `a //= 10` performs integer division on `a` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `a`. The other variables (`c`, `i`, `ans`, `copya`, and `h`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the modification of `a`.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of dividing `a` by `b`, `copya` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged, `h` is the last digit of `a`, and `a` is reduced by removing its last digit.**
