The value of `ans` is assigned the result of `a % b`, which calculates the remainder of dividing `a` by `b`. The values of `copya`, `c`, and their states are not directly affected by this operation, but the result of the modulus operation will determine the value of `ans`. Since the initial state mentions `copya` and `c` but does not specify their values, we focus on `ans`.

Output State: **`c` remains unchanged, `copya` remains unchanged, and `ans` is the remainder of dividing `a` by `b`.**
