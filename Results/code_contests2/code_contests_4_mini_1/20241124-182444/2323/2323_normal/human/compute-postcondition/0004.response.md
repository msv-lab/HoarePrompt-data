The value of `copya` is divided by 10 using integer division. The previous value of `copya` is not specified, but it will be reduced to one-tenth of its original value (ignoring any remainder). The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is reduced to one-tenth of its original value.**
