The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which means it takes the last digit of `a`. The other variables `c`, `i`, `copya`, and `ans` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them. Therefore, the output state is: `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `copya` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated, and `h` is the last digit of `a`.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `copya` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated, and `h` is the last digit of `a`**
