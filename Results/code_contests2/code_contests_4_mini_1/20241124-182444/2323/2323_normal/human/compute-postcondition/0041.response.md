The operation `a //= 10` performs an integer division of `a` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `a`. The value of `h` is defined as the last digit of `a` before this operation. The other variables, `c`, `i`, and `copya`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `a` and retains the other variable states.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `copya` remains unchanged, `h` is the last digit of `a`, and `a` is now the value of `a` divided by 10**
