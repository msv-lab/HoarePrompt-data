The variable `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`Stepan's integer`, `m`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the newly assigned variable.

Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `m` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `m` â‰¤ 10^8; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer**
