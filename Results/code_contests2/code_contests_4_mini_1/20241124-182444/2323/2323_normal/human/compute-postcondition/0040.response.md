The value of `h` is assigned the last digit of `a` using `a % 10`. The initial state does not specify the value of `a`, but it indicates that `a` is greater than 1. Therefore, `h` will be the last digit of whatever the current value of `a` is. The values of `c`, `i`, and `copya` remain unchanged. 

Since `a` is updated by removing its last digit and then adding `10`, but this specific operation is not represented in the provided code snippet, the output state will only reflect the assignment to `h`.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `copya` remains unchanged, and `h` is the last digit of `a`**
