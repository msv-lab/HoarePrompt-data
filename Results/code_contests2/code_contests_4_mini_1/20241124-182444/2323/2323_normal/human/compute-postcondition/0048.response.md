Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers as input: `a`, which is expected to be a positive integer, and `b`, which must be between 2 and 10^8. It calculates the minimum value of `a % b` after possibly moving the last non-zero digit of `a` to the front of the number. The function prints this minimum value. If `a` is zero or if all digits of `a` are zero, the function will return the result of `0 % b`, which is 0. Additionally, if `b` is less than 2 or greater than 10^8, it may not behave as intended.**
