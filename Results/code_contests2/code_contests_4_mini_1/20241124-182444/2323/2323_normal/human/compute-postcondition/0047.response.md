The function `func` accepts a parameter `Stepan's integer`, which is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits. It also accepts a parameter `m`, which is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8. The function processes these inputs and produces a result based on their values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer represented as a string (Stepan's integer) and an integer m (where 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8), and it returns a result based on these parameters.**
