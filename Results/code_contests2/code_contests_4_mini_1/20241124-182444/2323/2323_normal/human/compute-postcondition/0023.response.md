The operation `a //= 10` performs an integer division of `a` by 10 and assigns the result back to `a`. Since `a` is a multiple of 10, dividing it by 10 will yield a value that is still an integer (and will be less than the original value of `a`). The values of the other variables (`c`, `i`, `ans`, `copya`, and `h`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of dividing `a` by `b`, `copya` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged, `a` is now `a // 10`, and `h` is 0**
