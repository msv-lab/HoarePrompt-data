According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue executing as long as `copya` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` has been reduced by a division of 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must be greater than 0.

Since `copya` is currently `copya // 10`, it indicates that `copya` was at least 10 before this operation. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, `copya` must be adjusted to be at least 1.

State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `copya` is at least 10**
