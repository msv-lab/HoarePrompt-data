Postcondition: ***`c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `copya` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `a % b` if `a % 10` is not equal to 0. In both cases, `h` is the last digit of `a`, which is used to update `a` to `10 ** c * h + a // 10`. If `a % 10` equals 0, then `h` will be 0, and `a` is still updated accordingly.***
