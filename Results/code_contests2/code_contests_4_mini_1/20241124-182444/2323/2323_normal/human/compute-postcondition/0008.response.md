The value of `c` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `c` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `c` becomes 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `copya` is now `copya // 10`**
