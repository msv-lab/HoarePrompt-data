The value of `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which means that `h` becomes the last digit of `a`. Other variables (`c`, `i`, `copya`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `copya` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `a % b` if `a % 10` is not equal to 0, and `h` is the last digit of `a`.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `copya` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `a % b` if `a % 10` is not equal to 0, and `h` is the last digit of `a`.**
