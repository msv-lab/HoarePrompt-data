The value of `h` is assigned the last digit of `a`, which is calculated using `a % 10`. Since the initial state mentions that `a % 10` is not equal to 0, `h` will take the value of the last digit of `a`. The variables `c`, `i`, and `copya` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `copya` remains unchanged, and `h` is the last digit of `a`.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `copya` remains unchanged, and `h` is the last digit of `a`**
