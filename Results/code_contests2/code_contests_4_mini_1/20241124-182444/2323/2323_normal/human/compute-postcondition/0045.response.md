Output State: **`if c is greater than 0 then the loop will execute `c` times, `i` will take values from 0 to `c-1`, `copya` remains unchanged, and `ans` will be the minimum of its previous value and `a % b` for each iteration where `a % 10` is not equal to 0. If `c` is 0, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains as the remainder of dividing `a` by `b`.**
