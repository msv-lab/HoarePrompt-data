According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `copya` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` has been reduced to one-tenth of its original value. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must be greater than zero. Therefore, it needs to be adjusted so that `copya` is currently greater than zero, which implies that the original value of `copya` must have been greater than 1 (since reducing it to one-tenth would mean it can still be non-zero).

State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `copya` is greater than 1.**
