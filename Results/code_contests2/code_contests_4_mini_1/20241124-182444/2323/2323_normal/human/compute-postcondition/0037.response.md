The statement `a //= 10` performs an integer division of `a` by 10, effectively removing the last digit from `a`. The variable `h`, which is the last digit of `a` before this operation, will no longer be accurate after this operation since `a` will change.

The other variables `c`, `i`, and `copya` remain unchanged. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `a`, we can only state the impact of the operation without specifying new values for `a` or `h`.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `copya` remains unchanged, `h` is the last digit of `a` before `a` is divided by 10, and `a` is now reduced by removing its last digit.**
