The operation `a //= 10` performs integer division of `a` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `a`. The variable `h` is the last digit of `a` before this operation. Since `c` is greater than 1, it implies that `a` is also greater than 0, and thus this operation will change the value of `a`. 

The values of `c`, `i`, `copya`, and `ans` remain unchanged during this operation. The specific impact on `a` depends on its previous value, but since we only know that `c` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1, we can conclude the following:

Output State: **`c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `copya` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated, `h` is the last digit of `a`, and `a` is now reduced by removing its last digit.**
