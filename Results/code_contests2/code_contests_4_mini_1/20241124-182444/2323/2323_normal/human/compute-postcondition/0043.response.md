Postcondition: ***`c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `copya` remains unchanged. If `a % 10` is not equal to 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `a` is updated by removing its last digit and then adding `10 ** c * h`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `a % b`. If `a % 10` is equal to 0, `h` is still the last digit of `a`, and `a` is updated in the same way without affecting the value of `ans`. In both cases, `a` will always be a modified integer based on the last digit, and `h` captures the last digit before the update.***
