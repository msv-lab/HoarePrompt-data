The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input representing a positive integer in string form. This input will be converted to an integer. The initial state of Stepan's integer remains unchanged, and `m` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the input integer assigned to `a`.

Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `m` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `m` â‰¤ 10^8; `a` is an input integer**
