According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If `c` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `c` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. Therefore, the loop can execute again as long as `c` is greater than 1. 

So, the adjustments needed are:
- `i` should be incremented to 1.
- `c` needs to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `copya` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `a % b` if `a % 10` is not equal to 0, and `h` is the last digit of `a`, which is used to update `a` to `10`**
