The variable `copya` is assigned the value of `a`. The value of `a` is an input integer, but its specific value is not mentioned in the initial state. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is an input integer.
