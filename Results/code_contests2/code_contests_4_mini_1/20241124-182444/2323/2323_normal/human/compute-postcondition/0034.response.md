Postcondition: ***`c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `copya` remains unchanged. If `a % 10` is not equal to 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `a` is updated by removing its last digit and then adding `10 ** c * h` to it, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `a % b`. If `a % 10` is equal to 0, `h` is still the last digit of `a`, `a` is also updated by removing its last digit, but in this case, it is set to `10`. In both cases, `ans` is updated based on the modified value of `a`.***
