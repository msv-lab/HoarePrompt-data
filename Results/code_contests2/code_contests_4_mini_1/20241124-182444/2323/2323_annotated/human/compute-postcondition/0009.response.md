According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `copya` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is calculated as `a // 100`. Since `a` is at least 10, `copya` will be at least `10 // 100`, which is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be greater than 0. 

Thus, `a` needs to be adjusted to be at least 100, so that `copya` can be at least 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is at least 100, `b` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^8, `c` is 2, and `copya` is `a // 100`**
