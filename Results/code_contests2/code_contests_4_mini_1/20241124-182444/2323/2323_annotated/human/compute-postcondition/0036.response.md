The value of `h` is assigned the last digit of `a`, which is calculated as `a % 10`. The variables `a`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged in this step. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `h` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `c` is greater than 1, `copya` holds the original value of `a`, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the remainder of the new `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 2**
