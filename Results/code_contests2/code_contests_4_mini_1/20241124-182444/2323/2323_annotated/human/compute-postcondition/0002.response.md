The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^8, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^8, and `c` is 0**
