The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which calculates the last digit of `a`. Since it is given that the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` will take a value between 1 and 9, depending on the specific value of `a`. Other variables such as `c`, `copya`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is equal to `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 0, and `h` is the last digit of `a`.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `copya` is equal to `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 0, and `h` is the last digit of `a`**
