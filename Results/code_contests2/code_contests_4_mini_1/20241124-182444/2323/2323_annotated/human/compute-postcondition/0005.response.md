The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 0, so after execution, `c` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^8, `c` is 1, and `copya` is `a // 10`.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^8, `c` is 1, and `copya` is `a // 10**
