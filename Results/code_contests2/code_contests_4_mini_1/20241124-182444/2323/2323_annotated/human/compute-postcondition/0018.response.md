The value of `a` is updated by performing integer division by 10. This operation reduces `a` by removing its last digit. The previous values of the affected variables are: `copya` remains equal to the original value of `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` remains 0, `h` is the last digit of the original `a`. Therefore, after the operation, the new value of `a` will be the original value divided by 10.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `copya` is equal to the original `a`, `ans` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 0, `h` is the last digit of the original `a`, and `a` is the original `a` divided by 10**
