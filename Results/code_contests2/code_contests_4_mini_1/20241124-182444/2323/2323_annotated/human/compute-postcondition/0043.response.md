Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer, `h` is the last digit of the original `a`, and `c` is greater than 1. If `a` is not divisible by 10, then `h` is set to the last digit of `a`, `a` is divided by 10, and then updated to `10 ** c * h + a`, while `ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `a % b`. If `a` is divisible by 10, `h` is still set to the last digit of `a`, `a` is divided by 10, and updated to `10 ** c * h + a`, without changing `ans`. In both cases, `ans` retains the minimum value obtained from the first case or remains unchanged in the second case.***
