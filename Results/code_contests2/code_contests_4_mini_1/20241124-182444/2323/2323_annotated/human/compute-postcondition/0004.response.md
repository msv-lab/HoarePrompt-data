The value of `copya` is assigned the value of `a`, and then `copya` is divided by 10 using floor division (`//`). The impact of this operation is that `copya` will now hold the integer result of `a` divided by 10. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `copya`.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^8, `c` is 0, and `copya` is `a // 10`**
