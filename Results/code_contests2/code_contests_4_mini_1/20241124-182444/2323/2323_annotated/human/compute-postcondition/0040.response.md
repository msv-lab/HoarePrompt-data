The value of `h` is assigned the last digit of `a`, which is obtained by calculating `a % 10`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an integer, `c` is greater than 1, `copya` holds the original value of `a`, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the remainder of the new `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 2.
