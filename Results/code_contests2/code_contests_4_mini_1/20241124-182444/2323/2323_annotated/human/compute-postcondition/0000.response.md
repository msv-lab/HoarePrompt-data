The variable `a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input string representing a positive integer with no leading zeros. The conversion to an integer will produce a value for `a`. The variable `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will indicate the new value of `a` and the unchanged state of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^8**
