The value of `copya` is assigned the value of `copya // 10`. Initially, `copya` is `a // 10`. After performing the integer division by 10, the new value of `copya` will be `(a // 10) // 10`, which simplifies to `a // 100`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer and at least 10, `b` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^8, `c` is 1, and `copya` is `a // 100`**
