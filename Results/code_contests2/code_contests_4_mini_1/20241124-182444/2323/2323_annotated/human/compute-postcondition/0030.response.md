To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to focus on the variables that are affected.

1. The variable `ans` is modified by taking the minimum of its current value and the result of the expression `a % b`. 
2. The variable `a` is given to be modified by `10`, but its specific value is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact result of `a % b` without knowing `b`. 
3. Thus, we can conclude that `ans` will be updated based on the current value of `a % b`, but we don't have sufficient information about `a` and `b` to provide an exact output.

Therefore, our output state will reflect that `ans` has been modified without specifying exact values.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `a % b`, where `a` is modified by `10`**
