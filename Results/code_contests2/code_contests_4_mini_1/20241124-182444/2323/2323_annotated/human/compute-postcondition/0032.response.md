The operation `a //= 10` performs an integer division of `a` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `a`. The last digit of the original `a` is held in `h`, and `copya` contains the original value of `a`. The value of `c` remains greater than 0, and `i` is unchanged at 1. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `a` after removing the last digit, while other variables' states are unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is modified to remove the last digit, `h` is the last digit of the original `a`, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` holds the original value of `a`, `i` is 1**
