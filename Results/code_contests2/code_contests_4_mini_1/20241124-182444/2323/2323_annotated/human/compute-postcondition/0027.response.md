Output State: **`a` is modified such that if `a` is not divisible by 10, `h` becomes the last digit of the original `a`, `a` is reduced by one digit, and `h` is placed at the beginning of `a` shifted by `c` decimal places; if `a` is divisible by 10, `h` is set to 0, `a` is reduced by one digit, and no update to `ans` occurs; `c` remains greater than 0, `copya` holds the original value of `a`, and `i` is 1.**
