The function `func` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. The parameter `a` is a positive integer represented as a string without leading zeros, and the parameter `b` is an integer constrained between 2 and 10^8. The length of `a` can range from 2 to 200,000 digits, inclusive. 

The output of the function is not explicitly provided in the context, but based on the constraints, it is likely that the function performs an operation or computation involving these parameters.

Given the constraints and relationships, the functionality can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a string parameter `a` representing a positive integer and an integer parameter `b` within the range of 2 to 10^8, and it likely performs a computation based on these inputs.**
