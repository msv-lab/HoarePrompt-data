The value of `a` is updated by the expression `10 ** c * h + a`. Here, `10 ** c` represents `10` raised to the power of `c`, which is greater than 0. The last digit `h` is then multiplied by this result, and finally, the original value of `a` is added to it.

Since `c` is greater than 0, the term `10 ** c` will result in a number that is 10 or larger, depending on the specific value of `c`. Therefore, the new value of `a` will significantly increase. The original value of `a` is modified, and while `h` and `copya` retain their values, `i` remains unchanged at 1.

The output state reflects these changes. 

Output State: **`a` is updated, `h` is the last digit of the original `a`, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` holds the original value of `a`, `i` is 1**
