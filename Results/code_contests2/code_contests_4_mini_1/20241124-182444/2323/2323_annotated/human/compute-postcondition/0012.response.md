According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will execute as long as `copya` is non-zero (truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is 0, which means the loop cannot execute again. For the loop to be executed one more time, `copya` needs to be set to a non-zero value (greater than 0). 

No other states need to be adjusted since they do not affect the ability of the loop to execute. 

State: **`a` is at least 100, `b` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^8, `c` is 3, and `copya` is greater than 0**
