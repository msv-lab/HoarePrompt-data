The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Since `a` is a multiple of 10, the result of `a % 10` will be 0. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is equal to `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 0, `a` is a multiple of 10, and `h` is 0.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `copya` is equal to `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 0, `a` is a multiple of 10, and `h` is 0**
