The value of `a` is updated by performing integer division by 10. This effectively removes the last digit of `a`. The previous value of `a` is an integer, and since `h` is the last digit of `a`, after the operation, `h` is no longer valid as it represents the last digit before the operation. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer after removing the last digit, `c` is greater than 1, `copya` holds the original value of `a`, `h` is updated and is no longer the last digit of `a`, `ans` remains updated to the minimum of its original value and the remainder of the new `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`a` is an integer after removing the last digit, `c` is greater than 1, `copya` holds the original value of `a`, `h` is updated and is no longer the last digit of `a`, `ans` remains updated to the minimum of its original value and the remainder of the new `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 2**
