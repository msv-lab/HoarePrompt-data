The value of `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`. Here, `10 ** c` represents a power of 10 based on the value of `c`, and since `c` is greater than 1, `10 ** c` will be at least 100. The variable `h` is multiplied by this result and then added to the original value of `a`. 

The other variables (`copya`, `ans`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. The value of `a` will change based on the current values of `c`, `h`, and the original value of `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`, `c` is greater than 1, `copya` holds the original value of `a`, `h` is updated and is no longer the last digit of `a`, `ans` remains updated to the minimum of its original value and the remainder of the new `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 2.
