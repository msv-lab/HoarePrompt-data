According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is greater than 1, but we do not know the value of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `c`. 

Since `c` is greater than 1, we can infer that `i` must be at least 1 or 0. However, since the loop executes a total of `c` times, we can conclude that we need to adjust `i` to be 1 less than `c` for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, we need to adjust `c` to be greater than 2 (to ensure that it is still greater than 1) and set `i` to be equal to the value of the previous iteration plus one.

State: **`a` is an integer, `h` is the last digit of the original `a`, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `c`**
