The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 1, so after execution, `c` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input positive integer and at least 10, `b` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^8, `c` is 2, and `copya` is `a // 100`.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer and at least 10, `b` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^8, `c` is 2, and `copya` is `a // 100**
