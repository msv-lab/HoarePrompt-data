Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer, `c` is greater than 0, and `copya` holds the original value of `a`. If `a` is not divisible by 10, `h` is set to the last digit of the original `a`, `a` is reduced by one digit, and `h` is placed at the beginning of `a` shifted by `c` decimal places. `ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the remainder of the new `a` divided by `b`. If `a` is divisible by 10, `h` is set to 0, `a` is reduced by one digit, and no update to `ans` occurs. In both cases, `i` is set to 1.***
