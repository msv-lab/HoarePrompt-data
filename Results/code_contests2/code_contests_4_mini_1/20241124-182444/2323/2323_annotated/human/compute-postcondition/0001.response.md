The value of `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variable `a` remains unchanged, but the specific value of `b` is now an input integer that falls within the range of 2 to 10^8. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `b` and the unchanged value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^8**
