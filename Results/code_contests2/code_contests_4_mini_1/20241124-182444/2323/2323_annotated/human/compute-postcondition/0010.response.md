The variable `copya` is assigned the value of `a // 100`, which means it is at least 1 (since `a` is at least 100). The operation `copya //= 10` performs integer division on `copya` by 10. Therefore, the value of `copya` is reduced to `copya // 10`. Since `copya` is at least 1, after this operation, `copya` will be 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is at least 100, `b` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^8, `c` is 2, and `copya` is 0**
