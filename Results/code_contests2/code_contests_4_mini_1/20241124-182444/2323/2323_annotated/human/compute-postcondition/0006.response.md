According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `copya` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is equal to `a // 10`. Since `a` is a positive integer, `copya` will be zero when `a` is less than 10. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `a` must be at least 10 so that `copya` can be greater than zero. Therefore, we need to adjust the state: `a` should be at least 10, and `copya` must be greater than 0.

State: **`a` is an input positive integer and at least 10, `b` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^8, `c` is 1, and `copya` is `a // 10`**
