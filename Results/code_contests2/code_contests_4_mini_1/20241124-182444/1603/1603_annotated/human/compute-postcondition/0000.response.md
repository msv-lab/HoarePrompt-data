The code assigns values to `n` and `m` by reading input and splitting it into two integers. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `m` is also a positive integer within the same range. The raw input will provide new values for `n` and `m`, but the specific values are not defined in the initial state.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` depend on the input and we cannot determine them from the initial state, we can only state that they will be replaced with the values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is replaced with an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is replaced with an input positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000)**
