The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it relies on constraints involving `n` and `m`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000). Additionally, for each visitor, there are two parameters `l_i` and `r_i`, which are also positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.

Since the output is not specified in the given information, we cannot determine specific return values based on the visitor parameters. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate with the constraints of `n`, `m`, `l_i`, and `r_i`, and it processes this information based on the logic defined within the function. Without additional details on the output, we cannot specify return values.

Functionality: **The function operates with constraints involving positive integers n and m, and for each visitor, it uses positive integers l_i and r_i within specified bounds. The specific output is not defined.**
