The code assigns values to `n` and `m` based on the input received from `raw_input()`. The `map(int, ...)` function converts the split input strings into integers. The values of `n` and `m` are affected directly by the input provided, but the previous values of `n` and `m` are not specified. Therefore, we can only state that they will be positive integers as per the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of flowers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of visitors**
