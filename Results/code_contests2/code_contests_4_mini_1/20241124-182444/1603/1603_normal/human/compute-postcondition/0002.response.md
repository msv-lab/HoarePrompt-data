The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `m`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of flowers, and `m` is a positive integer representing the number of visitors. Each visitor's range `(l_i, r_i)` must satisfy the condition `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`. The function's output is not explicitly detailed, but it is implied that it will involve processing based on the provided `n` and `m` parameters and their corresponding ranges for the visitors. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n`, a positive integer representing the number of flowers, and `m`, a positive integer representing the number of visitors, where each visitor has a range `(l_i, r_i)` that satisfies `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`. The function processes these inputs accordingly.**
