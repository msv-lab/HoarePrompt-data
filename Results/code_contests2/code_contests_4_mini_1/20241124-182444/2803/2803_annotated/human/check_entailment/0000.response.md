To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

The problem requires us to find the largest possible xor-sum of selected candies, given two integers `n` and `k`. The candies are labeled from 1 to `n`, and we can select at most `k` candies.

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print(2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1 if k - 1 else n)
```

### Code Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Largest Xor-Sum:**
   - The expression `len(bin(n)[2:])` calculates the number of bits needed to represent the integer `n` in binary (excluding the '0b' prefix).
   - `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1` calculates the maximum value that can be represented with those bits (all bits set to 1).
   - The conditional statement checks if `k - 1` is true (i.e., `k > 1`). If true, it returns the maximum xor-sum; otherwise, it returns `n`.

### Understanding the Logic:
- The maximum xor-sum achievable when `k` candies can be chosen is indeed the maximum number that can be formed using the bits of integers up to `n`, which is `2^m - 1`, where `m` is the number of bits in `n`.
- However, if `k` equals 1, the largest xor-sum is simply `n`, as only one candy can be selected.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case when `n = 1` and `k = 1`:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Expected output: `1` (only candy available is 1)
   - The code will return `1`, which is correct.

2. **Case when `n = 2` and `k = 1`:**
   - Input: `2 1`
   - Expected output: `2` (only can take the candy labeled 2)
   - The code will return `2`, which is correct.

3. **Case when `n = 4` and `k = 3`:**
   - Input: `4 3`
   - Expected output: `7` (can take 1, 2, and 4)
   - The code will return `7`, which is correct.

4. **Case when `n = 6` and `k = 6`:**
   - Input: `6 6`
   - Expected output: `7` (can take all candies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
   - The code will return `7`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to find the largest xor-sum based on the problem description. It handles the maximum cases correctly for both the limits of `n` and the constraints given by `k`.

Correctness: **True**
