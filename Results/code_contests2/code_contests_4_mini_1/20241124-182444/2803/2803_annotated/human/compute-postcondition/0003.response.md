The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input. The functionality then checks the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than 1, it calculates and prints `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`, which effectively computes the value based on the number of bits needed to represent `n` in binary and subtracts 1 from that value. If `k` is equal to 1, it prints the value of `n`. The function does not handle any edge cases related to invalid input or specific constraints on `n` or `k`. The overall functionality is thus to read two integers and perform conditional calculations based on the value of the second integer.

Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, and prints `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1` if `k` is greater than 1, or prints `n` if `k` is 1. **
