The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints that both `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying the condition 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. However, since the function does not take any input parameters directly, we cannot describe the functionality in terms of input parameters and their relationships. The output of the function has not been specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters; its functionality cannot be determined without additional information about its output.**
