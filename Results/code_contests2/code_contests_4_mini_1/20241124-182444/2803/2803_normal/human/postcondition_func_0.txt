The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` via standard input. It calculates and returns `n` if `k` is equal to 1. If `k` is greater than 1, it returns `2` raised to the power of the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix) minus 1. This effectively computes the maximum value for `k` bits that can be represented, which is `2^(number of bits) - 1`.
