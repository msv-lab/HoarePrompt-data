The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as the signature suggests it takes no arguments. However, it works with two positive integers `n` and `k` that satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The function's output is not provided, so we cannot determine the return value or how it interacts with the inputs. 

Therefore, based on the given constraints, we can summarize:

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers n and k, constrained such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18, but the return value is not specified.**
