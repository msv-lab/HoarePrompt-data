Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the volume of the text as described in the problem statement. It currently finds the maximum number of capital letters in a single word, but it fails to consider the requirement that the volume of the text is defined as the maximum volume across all words. 

For example, consider the input:

```
30
Hello World This Is A Test
```

The individual word volumes would be:
- "Hello" has 1 capital letter.
- "World" has 1 capital letter.
- "This" has 1 capital letter.
- "Is" has 1 capital letter.
- "A" has 1 capital letter.
- "Test" has 1 capital letter.

The maximum volume (the maximum number of capital letters in any single word) is 1. This is handled correctly by the program. 

However, the problem description mentions "maximum volume across all words," which implies that if there are multiple words with varying counts of capital letters, it should return the maximum from those counts. 

Therefore, if we had an input where one word has more capital letters than others, the program would need to correctly output that count. 

Consider an edge case:

```
22
WORD ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE
```

In this case, "WORD" has 4 capital letters, while the others have 0. The expected output should be 4, which the program correctly handles. 

However, if we input a case like:

```
5
A B C D E
```

The expected output is 1 (each word has 1 capital letter), and the program outputs 1, which is correct.

However, if we have input with varying cases like:

```
30
This Is A Very Long Sentence With No Capital Letters At All
```

The program would output 1, which is incorrect since the maximum "volume" is actually 1 from "This", but words like "No", "Capital", etc., confuse the volume definition in terms of 'maximum volume as defined' across words.

Thus, the program does not handle the case properly where words have mixed capitalizations in the context of a sentence, leading to incorrect calculations in some cases.

Therefore, the program fails to adhere strictly to the problem description for all potential cases.
