The variable `m` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `n` and `l` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of single-space separated words from input, and `m` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of single-space separated words from input, `m` is 0**
