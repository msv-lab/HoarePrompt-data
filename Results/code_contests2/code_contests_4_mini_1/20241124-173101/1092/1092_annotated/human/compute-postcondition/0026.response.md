Postcondition: ***`s` is either 1 or 2; if the character `j` is uppercase, then `s` is incremented by 1 (making it 2), otherwise `s` remains unchanged at either 0 or 1. `m` is either the maximum of `s` or remains unchanged; `n` is unchanged; `l` is a list with at least one more element, and `i` is the second element in list `l`.***
