Postcondition: ***`s` is either 0 or 1, where if `j` is an uppercase character, `s` is incremented by 1 (resulting in `s` being 1), while `m` is either the maximum of `s` or remains unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `l` is a list with at least one more element, and `i` is the first element in list `l`. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains 0.***
