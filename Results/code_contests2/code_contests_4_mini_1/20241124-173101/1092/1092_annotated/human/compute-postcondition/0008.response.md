Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, and `i` is the first word in `l`. If the first character `j` of `i` is an uppercase letter, then `s` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `s` becomes 1). If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains 0.***
