According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which is the first word in the list `l` with at least 2 characters. The loop iterates over each character in the string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first word in `l`, and `j` is the third character of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must point to the next character in `i`. 

If `j` is the third character, then the loop has already processed the first three characters of `i`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be updated to the fourth character of `i`. Additionally, since `i` is the first word in the list `l`, it remains unchanged in this context.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be the fourth character of `i`.

We do not need to adjust `n`, `l`, `m`, or `s`, as they do not affect the iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of words containing at least one word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in `l` with at least 2 characters, and `j` is the fourth character of `i`.**
