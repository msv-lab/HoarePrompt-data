The variable `s` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `m`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables along with the new value of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in `l`, `s` is 0**
