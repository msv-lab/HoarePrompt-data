According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `l`. For the loop to execute at least once, the list `l` must contain at least one word. Given that `n` is a positive integer and represents the number of words in `l`, `l` must have a length of at least 1. 

At the end of the last iteration of the loop, `i` will be the last word in the list `l`. Since `m` is initialized to 0 and is not affected by the loop, it remains unchanged. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `l` should have at least 1 word, and `i` should be initialized to the first word in `l` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in `l`**
