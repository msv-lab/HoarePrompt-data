Postcondition: ***`s` is 0 or 1, if `j` is an uppercase character, `s` is incremented by 1 while `m` is either the maximum of the updated `s` or remains unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `l` is a list with at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element in the list `l`. If `j` is not an uppercase character, `s` remains 0, and `m` also remains unchanged.***
