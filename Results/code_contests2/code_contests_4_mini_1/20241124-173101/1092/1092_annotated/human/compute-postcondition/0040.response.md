The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Given that `s` can be either 0 or 1, after the operation, `s` will be either 1 or 2. The other variables (`m`, `n`, and `l`) remain unchanged, and `i`, being the second element in the list `l`, is unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is either 0 or 1; `s` is now either 1 or 2; `m` is unchanged; `n` is unchanged; `l` is a list with at least 2 elements; `i` is the second element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`s` is either 0 or 1; `s` is now either 1 or 2; `m` is unchanged; `n` is unchanged; `l` is a list with at least 2 elements; `i` is the second element in the list `l`**
