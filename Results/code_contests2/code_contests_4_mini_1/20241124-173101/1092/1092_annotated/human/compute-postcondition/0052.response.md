The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input, which is expected to contain a series of words separated by spaces. The function counts the number of uppercase letters in each word and keeps track of the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any single word. After processing all the words, the function prints the maximum count. If the input does not contain any words, the maximum count of uppercase letters will remain 0, and therefore the function will print 0 in such cases. 

Functionality: ** The function reads a line of input containing words, counts the maximum number of uppercase letters in any single word, and prints that maximum count. If no words are provided, it prints 0. **
