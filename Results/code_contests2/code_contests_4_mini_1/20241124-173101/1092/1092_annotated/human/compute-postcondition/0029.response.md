Postcondition: ***`s` is either 1 or 2; if `j` is uppercase, then `s` is increased by 1, resulting in `s` being either 2 or 3. `m` is either the maximum of `s` or remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `l` is a list with at least one element; and `i` is the third element of the list `l`. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains unchanged.***
