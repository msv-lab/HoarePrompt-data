Postcondition: ***`s` is either 0 or 1. If `j` is an uppercase letter, `s` is incremented by 1, resulting in a new value of either 1 or 2. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains unchanged. The values of `m` and `n` are unchanged, and `l` is a list with at least 2 elements, with `i` being the second element in the list `l`.***
