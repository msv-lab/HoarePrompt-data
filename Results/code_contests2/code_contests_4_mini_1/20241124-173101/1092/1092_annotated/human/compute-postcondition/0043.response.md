The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` can be either 1 or 2, the new value of `s` will be either 2 or 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is either 1 or 2; `l` is a list with at least 3 elements; `i` is the third element in the list `l`; and `s` is either 2 or 3.

Output State: **`s` is either 1 or 2; `l` is a list with at least 3 elements; `i` is the third element in the list `l`; `s` is either 2 or 3**
