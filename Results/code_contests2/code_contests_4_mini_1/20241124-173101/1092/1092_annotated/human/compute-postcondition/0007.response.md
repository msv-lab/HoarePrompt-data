The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `s` will be 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `m`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in `l`, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase letter.**
