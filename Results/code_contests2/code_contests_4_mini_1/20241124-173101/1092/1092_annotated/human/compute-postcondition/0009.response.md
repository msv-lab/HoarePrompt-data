According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `i`. The current value of `i` is the first word in the list `l`. Since `l` has at least 1 word and `i` is that word, there will be characters in `i` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the first character of `i`. If `i` has more than one character, the loop can execute again for the next character. However, if `i` is a single character, the loop will not execute again as there are no more characters to iterate over.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` has at least 2 characters, and `j` should be the second character of `i`. The value of `m` does not need to change since it is not affected by the loop's iterations. 

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in `l` with at least 2 characters, and `j` is the second character of `i`.**
