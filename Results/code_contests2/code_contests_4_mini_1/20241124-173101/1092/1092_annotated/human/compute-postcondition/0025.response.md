The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` can either be 0 or 1, after the execution, `s` can either be 1 or 2. The values of `m`, `n`, and `l` are not affected, and `i` remains unchanged as it is the second element in list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is either 0 or 1; `m` is either the maximum of `s` or remains unchanged; `n` is unchanged; `l` is a list with at least one more element; `i` is the second element in list `l`.

Output State: **`s` is either 1 or 2; `m` is either the maximum of `s` or remains unchanged; `n` is unchanged; `l` is a list with at least one more element; `i` is the second element in list `l**.
