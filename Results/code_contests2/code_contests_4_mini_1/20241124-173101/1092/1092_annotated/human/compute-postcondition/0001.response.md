The variable `l` is assigned the value of the input string split into a list of words, where `raw_input()` takes an input string and `split()` separates it based on spaces. The previous values of `n` and any other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `l` as a list of words while keeping `n` unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of single-space separated words from input**
