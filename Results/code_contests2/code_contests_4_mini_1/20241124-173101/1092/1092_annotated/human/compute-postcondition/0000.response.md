The code `raw_input()` accepts user input as a string, but does not change the values of the existing variables. The variable `n` remains a positive integer within the specified range, and no other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variable and indicates that input has been taken.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), and input has been taken as a string of single-space separated words.**
