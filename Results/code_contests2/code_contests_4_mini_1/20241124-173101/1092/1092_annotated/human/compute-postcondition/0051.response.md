The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200. It also processes a second input which is a string consisting of single-space separated words that are made up of small and capital Latin letters. 

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information, so we cannot specify the exact return values or behavior based on the inputs. However, we can infer that the function likely performs some operation involving the integer `n` and the string of words. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string of single-space separated words consisting of Latin letters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), and a string of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.**
