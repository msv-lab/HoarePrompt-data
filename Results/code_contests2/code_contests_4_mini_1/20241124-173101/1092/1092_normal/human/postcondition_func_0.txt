The function accepts a list of strings (inputted by the user) and calculates the maximum number of uppercase letters found in any single string within that list. It prints this maximum count. If no strings are provided, the count remains 0 and is printed. Note that the function does not handle any parameters directly, it relies on user input, and there is no explicit limit on the number of strings processed.
