The variable `l` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which captures a string input and then splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings from the input**
