Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `m` is 0, `i` is the first string in `l` with at least 1 character, and `j` is the first character of `i`. If `j` is an uppercase letter, then `s` is incremented by 1, resulting in `s` being 1. If `j` is not an uppercase letter, `s` remains 0.***
