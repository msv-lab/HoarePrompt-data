Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings containing at least two elements, `s` is either 0 or 1 (remaining unchanged unless incremented by 1), `m` remains unchanged, `i` is an iterable with at least two elements, and `j` is the second element of `i`. If `j` is an uppercase string, `s` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
