Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings with at least one more string, `s` is either 0 or 1 (increased by 1 if `j` is an uppercase string), `m` remains unchanged, `i` is an iterable with at least one element, and `j` is the first element of `i`. If `j` is an uppercase string, `s` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `s` remains 0.***
