The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and a `text`. The parameter `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200, representing the length of the `text`. The parameter `text` is a string consisting of single-space separated words composed only of small and capital Latin letters. 

Based on the output specifications, the function will process these inputs, but the specific return values or conditions based on the content of `text` are not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function will be framed around the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `text` consisting of single-space separated words made up of small and capital Latin letters.**
