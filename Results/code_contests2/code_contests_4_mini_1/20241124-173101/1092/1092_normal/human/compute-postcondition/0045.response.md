According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has at least one more element and `j` is the next element in `i`. Since `j` is either an uppercase letter or not, `s` can either be 0 or incremented to 1 based on the value of `j`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to point to the next element in the sequence of `i`. Since `j` is currently the next element in `i`, we need to increment `j` to the subsequent element in `i`. The value of `s` will depend on whether the new `j` is an uppercase letter or not.

Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted apart from indicating that `j` has moved to the next element in `i`.

State: **`s` is either 0 or 1, `i` has at least one more element, `j` is the next element in `i`**
