The code initializes `m` to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, which is an integer within the range of 1 to 200, and `l`, which is a list of strings from the input. The initialization of `m` does not affect `n` or `l`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all variables involved.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings from the input, `m` is 0**
