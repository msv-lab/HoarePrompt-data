According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `i`. The loop iterates over the characters in the string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first string in the list `l` with at least 1 character, and `j` is the second character of `i`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must have more characters remaining after the current value of `j`.

Since `j` is the second character of `i`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to have at least 3 characters (at least one character after `j`). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect that it must have at least 3 characters. Additionally, the variable `j` should be updated to the third character of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `m` is 0, `i` is the first string in `l` with at least 3 characters, and `j` is the third character of `i`.**
