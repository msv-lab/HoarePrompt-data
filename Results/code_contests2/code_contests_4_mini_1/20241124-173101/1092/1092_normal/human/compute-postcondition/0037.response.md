The value of `s` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 0 to 1. The other variables `m`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 1, `m` remains unchanged, `l` has at least one more element, `i` has at least one element, `j` is the first element of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase character.

Output State: **`s` is 1, `m` remains unchanged, `l` has at least one more element, `i` has at least one element, `j` is the first element of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase character**
