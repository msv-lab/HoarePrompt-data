The variable `s` is assigned the value of 0. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. Thus, the output state is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `m` is 0, `i` is the first string in `l`, and `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `m` is 0, `i` is the first string in `l`, and `s` is 0**
