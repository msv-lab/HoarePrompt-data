In this case, `s` is assigned the value `0`, which resets its previous value. The variable `m` remains unchanged, and there is no indication of any specific value for `s` prior to this assignment, but it is now explicitly set to `0`. The state of other variables, including `l`, is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 0, `m` remains unchanged, and `l` has at least one more element.

Output State: **`s` is 0, `m` remains unchanged, and `l` has at least one more element**
