Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings containing at least two elements, and `m` remains unchanged. If `j` is an uppercase string, then `s` is incremented by 1, making `s` either 1 or 2. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains unchanged. Additionally, `i` is an iterable with at least three elements, and `j` is the new second element of `i`.***
