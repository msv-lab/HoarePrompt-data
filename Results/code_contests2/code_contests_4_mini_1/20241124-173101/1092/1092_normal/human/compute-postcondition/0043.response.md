The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Given that `s` can either be 0 or 1, the new value of `s` will be 1 or 2, respectively. The states of `i` and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is either 0 or 1; `i` has at least one more element; `j` is the next element in `i`.

Output State: **`s` is either 0 or 1; `i` has at least one more element; `j` is the next element in `i`**
