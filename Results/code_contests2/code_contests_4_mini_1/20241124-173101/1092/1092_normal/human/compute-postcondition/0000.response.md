The value of `raw_input()` represents a string input taken from the user, but since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), the value of `n` is unaffected by this operation. The operation does not change any variables, but it captures user input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), and a string input is captured via `raw_input()`**
