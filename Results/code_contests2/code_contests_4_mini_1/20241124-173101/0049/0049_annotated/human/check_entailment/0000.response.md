To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks us to identify if there exists a substring in the string `s` that can be reversed to yield a lexicographically smaller string. The program needs to output "YES" and the indices of such a substring if it exists, or "NO" if it does not.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads the length `n` of the string and the string `c`.
2. It initializes a flag `flag` to `False` and iterates over the string to check if there exists an index `i` such that `c[i] > c[i + 1]`.
3. If such an index is found, it sets `flag` to `True` and stores the index in `pos`.
4. After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it prints "YES" and the indices `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. If `flag` is `False`, it prints "NO".

### Code Logic:
- The loop checks for any instance where a character is greater than the following character, which indicates that reversing that substring could create a smaller string.
- It correctly identifies the last such pair, which is a valid choice for reversing.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. For the string "aabcfg", the program correctly identifies there are no pairs where `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, so it outputs "NO".
2. For the string "abacaba", the program identifies the pair (c[2], c[3]) = (a, c) as a valid choice to reverse, resulting in "aacabba", which is lexicographically smaller.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the required comparisons and outputs the correct result based on the findings.

Since I could not identify any input for which the program would fail to meet the problem requirements, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
