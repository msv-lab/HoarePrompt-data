The function reads an integer `n` and a string `c` from input. It checks if there are any two consecutive characters in the string such that the first character is greater than the second. If such a pair exists, it prints 'YES' along with the 1-based indices of the pair; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is less than 2, it directly prints 'NO' without performing any comparisons.
