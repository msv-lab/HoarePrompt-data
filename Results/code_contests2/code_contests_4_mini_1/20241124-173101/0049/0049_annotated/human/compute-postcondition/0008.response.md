Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 0, `c` is an input string, and `flag` is set to True if the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c`; `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. If the character at index `i` is not greater than the character at index `i + 1`, `flag` remains False and `pos` is not defined.***
