Postcondition: ***If `n` is at least 2 and `flag` is True, the program prints 'YES' along with the indices `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`, where `pos` is the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`. If `n` is at least 2 and `flag` is False, the program prints 'NO', indicating that there are no such characters in the sequence `c` that satisfy the condition for `i` in the range of `0` to `n-2`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, `flag` remains False, and `pos` is not defined, leading the program to print 'NO'.***
