Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 1, `c` is an input string. If `c[1]` is greater than `c[2]`, then `flag` is set to True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. If `c[1]` is not greater than `c[2]`, `flag` remains unchanged and `pos` retains its initial value of 1.***
