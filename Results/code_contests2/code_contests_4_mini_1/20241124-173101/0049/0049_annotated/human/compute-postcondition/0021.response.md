The `print` statement outputs the values of `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. The variable `pos` holds the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`. Since `n` is at least 2, `pos + 1` and `pos + 2` will be valid indices as long as `pos` is within the range of `0` to `n-2`. 

The output does not change the state of the variables but simply prints the calculated values. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `flag` is True, `pos` holds the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, and the output is 'YES'. The printed values are `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `flag` is True, `pos` holds the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, and the output is 'YES' (printed values: `pos + 1`, `pos + 2`)**.
