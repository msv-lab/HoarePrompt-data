The code assigns the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to `n`. The `raw_input()` function reads a line of input as a string, `split()` divides this string into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and `map(int, ...)` converts each substring into an integer. The previous value of `n` is overwritten with the resulting map object, effectively changing `n` from a single integer to an iterable map object that produces integers.

Since `n` is originally defined as an integer and it gets reassigned to a map object, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is a map object containing integers from input, and `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
