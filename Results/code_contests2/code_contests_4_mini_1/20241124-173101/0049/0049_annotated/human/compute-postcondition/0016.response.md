Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `c` is an input string, and `flag` remains unchanged. If the character at index `i` of string `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to True and `pos` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `flag` and `pos` remain unchanged.***
