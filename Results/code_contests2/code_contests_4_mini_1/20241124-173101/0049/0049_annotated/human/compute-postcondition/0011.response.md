The value of `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The previous value of `pos` was also 1, but since it is being assigned the value of `i`, it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 1, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, and `pos` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 1, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, and `pos` is 1**
