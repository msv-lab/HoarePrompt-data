The variable `n` is assigned the value of `n[0]`, which means it takes the first element of the `map` object. This modifies `n` to hold a single integer value instead of the original `map` object. The variable `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `n` and the unchanged state of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the map object, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters**
