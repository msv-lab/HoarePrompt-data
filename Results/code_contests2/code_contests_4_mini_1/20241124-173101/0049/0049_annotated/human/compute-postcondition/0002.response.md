The variable `c` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which accepts user input as a string. The previous values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this input operation. The output state reflects that `c` is now assigned an input string value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer from the map object, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the map object, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is an input string.**
