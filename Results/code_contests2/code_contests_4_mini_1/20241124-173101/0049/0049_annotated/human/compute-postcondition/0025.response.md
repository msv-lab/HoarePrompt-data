The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The function's output is not described in the provided information, so we cannot specify what it returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with an integer `n` that meets certain constraints and a string `s` of a specified length. However, without the output details, we cannot define the complete functionality.

Functionality: **The function operates with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string s of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, but the specific return value is not provided.**
