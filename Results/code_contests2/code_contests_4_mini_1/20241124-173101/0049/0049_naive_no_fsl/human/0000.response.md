Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly identify all cases where reversing a substring can yield a lexicographically smaller string. 

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input string `s = "abccba"`. The program checks pairs of adjacent characters and finds that `c` (at index 3) is greater than `b` (at index 4), setting `flag` to `True` and returning indices `3` and `4`. However, reversing the substring `s[3:4]` (which consists of the single character `c`) does not change the string and does not yield a lexicographically smaller string. 

The correct output for this case should be "NO", but the program incorrectly outputs "YES" and indices `3` and `4`. 

Additionally, the program only checks adjacent pairs, which is insufficient. It needs to consider more complex cases where reversing longer substrings could also yield a lexicographically smaller string. Thus, the program fails to cover all edge cases and scenarios outlined in the problem description.
