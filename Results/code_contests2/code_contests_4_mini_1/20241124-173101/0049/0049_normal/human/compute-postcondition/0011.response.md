The value of `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The previous values of the affected variables are `i` is 1, and `pos` is now assigned the same value as `i`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `c` is a string of length at least 3, `flag` is True, `i` is 1, and `pos` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `c` is a string of length at least 3, `flag` is True, `i` is 1, `pos` is 1**
