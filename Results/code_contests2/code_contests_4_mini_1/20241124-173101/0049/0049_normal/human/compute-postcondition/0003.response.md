The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The initial states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, and `c`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer from input, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is a string from raw_input(), and `flag` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is a string from raw_input(), and `flag` is False**
