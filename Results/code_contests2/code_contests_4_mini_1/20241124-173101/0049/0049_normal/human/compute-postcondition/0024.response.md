Postcondition: ***If `n` is at least 2 and `flag` is True, indicating that there exists at least one index `i` such that `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, then 'YES' is printed along with `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. If `n` is at least 2 and `flag` is False, meaning no such index exists, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, `flag` remains False, and `pos` is not defined, resulting in 'NO' printed.***
