Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `c` is a string of length at least 3, `flag` is True, `i` is 2, and `pos` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, then `flag` remains True and `pos` is updated to 2. If the character at index `i` is not greater than the character at index `i + 1`, `flag` remains True and `pos` remains 1.***
