Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (which it reads from input) and a string `c` of length `n`, also read from input. It checks if there exists at least one index `i` such that the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`. If such an index exists, it prints 'YES' along with the 1-based indices of the two characters; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is less than 2, it directly prints 'NO' without performing any comparisons. **
