According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n - 2`, which means for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `2` (because if `n` is `1`, the range becomes `range(0)` and the loop will not execute). 

Given that at the end of the last iteration, `i` will be incremented on each iteration, we need to start with `i` at `0`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least `2`, and `i` starts at `0`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is a string from raw_input(), `flag` is False, `i` is 0**
