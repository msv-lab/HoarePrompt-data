`flag` is assigned the value `True`, changing its previous value from `False` to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is a string from raw_input(), `flag` is True, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c`.
