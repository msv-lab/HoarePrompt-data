The code assigns the value of `n` to the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes the input and converts it into integers. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 300000, but the specific input value for `n` is not provided. The variable `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that `n` is now assigned a new integer value from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters**
