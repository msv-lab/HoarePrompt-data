The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is an integer constrained such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300000\), and the parameter `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The specific output of the function is not provided in the details. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s` that adheres to the specified constraints. The exact behavior of the function, such as what it returns based on these inputs, is not described. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
