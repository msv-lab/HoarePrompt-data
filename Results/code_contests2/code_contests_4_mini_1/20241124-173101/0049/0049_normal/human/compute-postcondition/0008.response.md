Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is a string from raw_input(), `flag` is set to True, `i` is 0, and `pos` is assigned the value of `i` (0) if the character at position `i` in `c` is greater than the character at position `i + 1`. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains False, and `pos` is not defined within this fragment.***
