Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `c` is a string of length at least 3, `flag` is True, `i` is 1, and `pos` is initially assigned the value of `1` if the character at position `1` in `c` is greater than the character at position `2`. If the character at position `1` in `c` is greater than the character at position `2`, `flag` remains True and `pos` is updated to `i` (which is 1). If the character at position `1` in `c` is not greater than the character at position `2`, `flag` remains True and `pos` retains its value, which is 1.***
