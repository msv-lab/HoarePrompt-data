The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, it is implied that the function operates within the constraints provided: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^{12}\), and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\). 

Since the output behavior of the function is not described, we cannot ascertain specific return values. Therefore, without explicit output details, we can only summarize the constraints. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates within the constraints that n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12) and a and b are positive integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). The output behavior is not specified.**
