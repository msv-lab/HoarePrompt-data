The code snippet provided is an empty dictionary initialization `{}`. This operation does not modify the state of any existing variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `b`) or create new variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^12, and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100**
