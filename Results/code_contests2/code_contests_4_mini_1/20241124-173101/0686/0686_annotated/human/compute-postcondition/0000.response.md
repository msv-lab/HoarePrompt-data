The provided code snippet is an empty dictionary initialization (`{}`), which does not alter the state of any variables. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, as there are no operations performed on them. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions without any modifications.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^12; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100**
