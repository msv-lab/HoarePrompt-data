The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. The parameters `n` and `m` are integers constrained by the condition that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^{12}\), while `a` and `b` are integers constrained by \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\). The function's output is not specified, so we cannot describe the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four integer parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, under the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m as integers within the range of 1 to 10^12, and parameters a and b as integers within the range of 1 to 100.**
