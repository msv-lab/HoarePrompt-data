Correctness: **False**. 

The program is not provided, which means there is no implementation to verify against the problem description. Since we cannot assess any logic or correctness without the code, it is impossible to determine if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem statement. Therefore, it fails to fulfill the task, leading to an incorrect conclusion.
