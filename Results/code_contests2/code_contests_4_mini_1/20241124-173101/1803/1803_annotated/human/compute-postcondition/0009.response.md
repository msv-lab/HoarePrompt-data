To understand the impact of the code, let's break it down step by step:

1. The initial state indicates that `Cadena` is an input string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}".
2. `Arreglo` is a list that contains the character at index 1 and the character at index 4 of `Cadena`.
3. The variable `k` is increased by 3, and we know that `len(Cadena)` is greater than the previous value of `k` (which was `k - 3`).
4. The code `Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]` appends the character at the new index `k` of `Cadena` to `Arreglo`.

Now, `k` has been updated to a new value (previous `k` + 3), and the length of `Cadena` is greater than this new value of `k`. Therefore, `Cadena[k]` is valid and can be accessed.

After executing the code, `Arreglo` will now include the character at index `k` of `Cadena`, in addition to the characters already present from indices 1 and 4.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` now contains the characters from indices 1, 4, and k of `Cadena`; `k` has been increased by 3.**
