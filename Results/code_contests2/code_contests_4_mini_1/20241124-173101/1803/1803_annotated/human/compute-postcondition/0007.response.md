The value of `k` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `k` is unknown. The other variables (`Cadena` and `Arreglo`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `Cadena` is an input string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` is a list containing the character at index 1 of `Cadena` and the character at index 4 of `Cadena`; `k` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` is a list containing the character at index 1 of `Cadena` and the character at index 4 of `Cadena`; `k` is increased by 3**
