The code snippet assigns a new value to `Arreglo` by concatenating the current list with a new list containing the character from `Cadena` at index `k`. The initial state specifies that `k` is 4, so `Cadena[k]` refers to the character at index 4 of `Cadena`.

Since the length of `Cadena` is greater than 4, `Cadena[k]` will successfully retrieve a character. The previous value of `Arreglo` is a list containing the character at index 1 of `Cadena`. After executing the code, `Arreglo` will now contain its original value plus the new character from `Cadena`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the initial character at index 1 in `Cadena` and the new character added from index 4.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` is a list containing the character at index 1 of `Cadena` and the character at index 4 of `Cadena` has been added.**
