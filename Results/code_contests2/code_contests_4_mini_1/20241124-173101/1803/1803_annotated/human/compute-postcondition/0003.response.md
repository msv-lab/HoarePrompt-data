The code assigns a new value to `Arreglo` by concatenating the current content of `Arreglo` with a list containing the element at index `k` from `Cadena`. The initial state indicates that `Cadena` is a string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}" and `k` is 1. Therefore, `Cadena[k]` refers to the character at index 1 of the string `Cadena`.

Assuming `Cadena` is a string of characters that includes at least two characters (e.g., "{a, b}"), the value at `Cadena[1]` would be the second character in the string. `Arreglo` is initially an empty list, so it will now contain the character present at index 1 of `Cadena`. 

Since `Cadena` is an input string, the specific value of `Cadena[1]` cannot be determined without the actual input. However, we can conclude that `Arreglo` will now contain one element, which is the character at `Cadena[1]`.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` is a list containing the character at index 1 of `Cadena`; `k` is 1**
