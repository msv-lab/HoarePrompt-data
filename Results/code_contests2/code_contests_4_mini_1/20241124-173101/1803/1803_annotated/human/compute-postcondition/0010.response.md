The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since `k` has been increased, its new value will be the previous value plus 3. The states of the other variables, `Cadena` and `Arreglo`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `Cadena` is an input string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` now contains the characters from indices 1, 4, and k, and `k` has been increased by 3.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` now contains the characters from indices 1, 4, and k, and `k` has been increased by 3.**
