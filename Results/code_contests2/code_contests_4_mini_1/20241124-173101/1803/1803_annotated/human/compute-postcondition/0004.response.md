The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Given that `k` starts at 1, after the execution, `k` becomes 4. The other variables `Cadena` and `Arreglo` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `Cadena` is an input string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` is a list containing the character at index 1 of `Cadena`; `k` is 4.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` is a list containing the character at index 1 of `Cadena`; `k` is 4**
