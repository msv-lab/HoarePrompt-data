The function accepts a string input from the user and processes it to extract characters from specific indices (1, 4, 7, ...) while skipping two characters at a time. It creates a list of these characters and then prints the number of unique characters present in that list. If the input string's length is 2 or less, no characters are added to the list, and the output will be 0, indicating no unique characters.
