The function accepts no parameters, reads a string input from the user, and constructs a list `Arreglo` that contains characters from the input string at indices 1, 4, 7, etc., as long as the input string has more than 2 characters. It then prints the count of unique characters in `Arreglo`. If the input string is 2 characters or shorter, it does not process any characters and will print 0 since `Arreglo` remains empty in that case.
