The value of `k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is 7, so after execution, `k` becomes 10. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` contains the original elements based on `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]`, and now includes `Cadena[7]`; `k` is 10, and `len(Cadena)` is greater than 7.

Output State: **`Arreglo` contains the original elements based on `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]`, and now includes `Cadena[7]`; `k` is 10, and `len(Cadena)` is greater than 7**.
