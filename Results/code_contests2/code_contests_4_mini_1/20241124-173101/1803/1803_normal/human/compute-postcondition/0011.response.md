According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the conditions involving `len(Cadena)` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `len(Cadena)` is greater than `k` (which is 10) and greater than 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 10 and `len(Cadena)` is greater than 7. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `len(Cadena)` must be greater than 10. Since it's only guaranteed to be greater than 7, it needs to be adjusted.

State: **`Arreglo` contains the original elements based on `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]`, and now includes `Cadena[7]`; `k` is 10, and len(Cadena) is greater than 10**
