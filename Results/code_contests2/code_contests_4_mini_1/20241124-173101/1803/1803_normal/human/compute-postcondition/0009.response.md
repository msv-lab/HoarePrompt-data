The code assigns a new value to `Arreglo` by concatenating it with a list containing the element at index `k` of `Cadena`. Given that `k` is 7 and `len(Cadena)` is greater than 7, the access `Cadena[k]` is valid. The previous values of `Arreglo` are based on `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]`. Therefore, after execution, `Arreglo` will contain its original elements plus the new element from `Cadena[7]`.

Output State: **`Arreglo` contains the original elements based on `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]`, and now includes `Cadena[7]`; `k` is 7, and `len(Cadena)` is greater than 7**
