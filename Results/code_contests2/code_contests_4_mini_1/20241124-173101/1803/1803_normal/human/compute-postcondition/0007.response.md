The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since `k` initially is 4, after the execution, `k` becomes 7. The other variables (`Arreglo` and `Cadena`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `Arreglo` contains two elements based on `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]`, `k` is 7, and `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4.

Output State: **`Arreglo` contains two elements based on `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]`, `k` is 7, and `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4**
