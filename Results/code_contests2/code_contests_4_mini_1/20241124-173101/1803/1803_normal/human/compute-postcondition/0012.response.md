Output State: **If len(Cadena) is greater than 2, then `Arreglo` contains elements from `Cadena` at indices 1, 4, 7, ..., up to the highest index that is less than len(Cadena). `k` will be equal to 1 plus 3 times the number of iterations of the loop. If len(Cadena) is 2 or less, the loop does not execute and `Arreglo` remains empty while `k` stays 1.**
