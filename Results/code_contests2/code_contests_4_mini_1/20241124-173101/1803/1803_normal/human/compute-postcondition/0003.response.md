The variable `Arreglo` is assigned the value of `Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]`. Since `Arreglo` is initially an empty list and `k` is 1, the value of `Cadena[k]` is accessed. However, the content of `Cadena` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value being added to `Arreglo`.

The result is that `Arreglo` will contain one element, which is the value of `Cadena[1]`. The value of `Cadena[1]` remains unspecified. Thus, the output state indicates the current state of `Arreglo` and that it now contains one element based on `Cadena[k]`.

Output State: **`Arreglo` contains one element based on `Cadena[1]`, `k` is 1**
