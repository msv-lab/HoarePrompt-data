The code assigns a new value to `Arreglo` by concatenating it with a list containing the element from `Cadena` at index `k`. Since `k` is 4, the new element added to `Arreglo` will be `Cadena[4]`. The initial state indicates that `Arreglo` already contains one element based on `Cadena[1]`. After the execution, `Arreglo` will now contain two elements: the original element from `Cadena[1]` and the new element from `Cadena[4]`. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`Arreglo` contains two elements based on `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]`, `k` is 4, and `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4**
