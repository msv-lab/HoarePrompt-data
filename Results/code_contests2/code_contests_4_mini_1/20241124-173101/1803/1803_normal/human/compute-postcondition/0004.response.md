The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since `k` is initially 1, after execution, `k` becomes 4. The state of `Arreglo` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `Arreglo` contains one element based on `Cadena[1]`, `k` is 4.

Output State: **`Arreglo` contains one element based on `Cadena[1]`, `k` is 4**
