To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the provided problem description and the provided code.

### Problem Description:
- The input is a string representing a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets `{}`.
- The letters are separated by a comma followed by a space.
- We need to count the number of distinct letters in the set.

### Provided Program:
```python
Cadena = raw_input()
Arreglo = []
k = 1
while len(Cadena) > k and len(Cadena) > 2:
    Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]
    k = k + 3
print(len(list(set(Arreglo))))
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The program reads the input string `Cadena`.
2. It initializes an empty list `Arreglo` to store the letters.
3. The loop starts from `k = 1` and checks if `Cadena` has more than 2 characters and if the current index `k` is within bounds.
4. Inside the loop, it adds the character at index `k` from `Cadena` to `Arreglo`. It then increments `k` by 3 each time, which is used to skip over the comma and space after each letter.
5. Finally, it converts `Arreglo` to a set to get distinct letters and prints the length of that set.

### Potential Issues:
- The program assumes that the input will always follow the specified format strictly (i.e., `{a, b, c}`), which is a valid assumption given the problem guarantees.
- However, the logic used to parse the string contains a flaw. The loop increments `k` by 3, which means it will only correctly extract letters if there is a consistent format with no extra spaces or commas. For example, if an input like `{a, b, c, d}` is provided, this will work, but if the input is `{a , b, c}`, it will fail because it doesn't handle spaces correctly.
- Importantly, if the input is empty like `{}`, the while condition will not execute, and `Arreglo` will remain empty. The output will correctly count the distinct letters as 0, which is valid.

### Example of Failure:
- For an input like `{a , b, c}`, the program will not correctly extract the letters because it only grabs characters at positions based on a fixed increment (i.e., `k = k + 3`), which does not account for varying lengths of letters or spacing issues.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle all potential formatting cases as described in the problem prompt, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
