Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is 1 or 2, the program attempts to print -1, but there is a syntax error due to an invalid print statement. If `n` is an odd integer greater than 2, the outputs are `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is an even integer greater than 2, the outputs are `(n^2 / 4 - 1)` and `(n^2 / 4 + 1)`. The program effectively handles all positive integers in the specified range, ensuring correct outputs based on the parity of `n` while noting that the syntax error occurs for the cases where `n` is 1 or 2.***
