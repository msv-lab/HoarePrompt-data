The code attempts to execute the `print` function with an invalid syntax due to the misplaced hyphen. The variable `n` is unaffected since it is not referenced in the print statement. Therefore, the output state is that `n` retains its value in the specified range, and there is a syntax error.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2, and there is a syntax error due to invalid print statement**.
