The code assigns the value of `int(raw_input())` to `n`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer within the range from 1 to 10^9, the output state will reflect that `n` is now a new positive integer input received from the user. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input from the user such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9**
