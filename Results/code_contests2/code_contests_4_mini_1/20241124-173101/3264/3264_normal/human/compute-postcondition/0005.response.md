To evaluate the code, we need to analyze the expressions involving `n`. Given that `n` is a positive odd integer between 2 and 10^9, we can denote it as an odd integer, which means it takes values such as 3, 5, 7, etc.

1. The expression `(n * n - 1) / 2`: 
   - Since `n` is an odd integer, `n * n` will be odd and thus `n * n - 1` will be even. The division by 2 will yield an integer result.

2. The expression `(n * n + 1) / 2`: 
   - Similarly, `n * n` is odd, hence `n * n + 1` will be even. The division by 2 will also yield an integer result.

The output will consist of two values computed from `n`:
- The first value will be `(n * n - 1) / 2`.
- The second value will be `(n * n + 1) / 2`.

Let's denote `result1 = (n * n - 1) / 2` and `result2 = (n * n + 1) / 2`. 

Since we do not have a specific value for `n`, we can express the output state in terms of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^9, `n` is an odd integer; the results are `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`.**
