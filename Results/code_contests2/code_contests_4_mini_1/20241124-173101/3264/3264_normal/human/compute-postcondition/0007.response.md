The code prints two expressions involving `n`. The first expression is `n * n / 4 - 1` and the second expression is `n * n / 4 + 1`. 

1. The variable `n` is a positive even integer input from the user, such that `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to \(10^9\).
2. The first expression evaluates to \(\frac{n^2}{4} - 1\), and the second expression evaluates to \(\frac{n^2}{4} + 1\).
3. The values of these expressions depend directly on the value of `n`.

Since `n` is an even integer, we can denote it as \(n = 2k\) for some integer \(k\), where \(k\) is at least 2 and at most \(5 \times 10^8\). 

Calculating the expressions:
- The first expression becomes \((2k)^2 / 4 - 1 = k^2 - 1\).
- The second expression becomes \((2k)^2 / 4 + 1 = k^2 + 1\).

Thus, the outputs are \(k^2 - 1\) and \(k^2 + 1\), where \(k = n/2\).

The output does not specify exact numerical values since `n` is an input, but it clearly defines the relationships based on the variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer input from the user, where `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^9; the output is `k^2 - 1` and `k^2 + 1` for `k = n/2`.**
