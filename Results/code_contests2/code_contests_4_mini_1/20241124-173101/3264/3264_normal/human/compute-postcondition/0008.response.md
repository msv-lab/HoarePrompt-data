Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^9. If `n` is odd, the outputs are `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is even, the outputs are `(n^2 / 4 - 1)` and `(n^2 / 4 + 1)`. The function effectively handles all positive integers in the specified range, ensuring correct outputs based on the parity of `n`.***
