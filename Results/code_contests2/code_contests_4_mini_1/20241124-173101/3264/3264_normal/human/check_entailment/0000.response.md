The program provided is intended to find a Pythagorean triple given one side of a right triangle, `n`. 

Let's analyze the code and the problem description step by step:

### Problem Description:
1. The program must accept an integer `n` (the length of one side of a right triangle).
2. It must return two integers `m` and `k` such that `n`, `m`, and `k` form a Pythagorean triple.
3. If no such triple exists, it should return `-1`.

### Analyzing the Code:
```python
n = int(raw_input())
if n <= 2:
    print - 1
elif n & 1:
    (print(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)
else:
    (print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1)
```
1. The code checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If so, it prints `-1`. This is correct as no Pythagorean triple can be formed with sides less than or equal to 2.
2. For odd values of `n` greater than 2, it computes two values intended to form a Pythagorean triple: `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. This is valid for odd integers.
3. For even values of `n` greater than 2, it computes `(n * n / 4 - 1)` and `(n * n / 4 + 1)`. This is also a valid computation for even integers.

### Issues in the Code:
- There is a syntax error in the use of `print` statements for the odd and even cases. The parentheses around the print statements make it look like a tuple construction instead of a print call.
- The output does not explicitly handle the case when `n` equals `1`, as it directly leads to `-1`.

### Output Hints:
- The hints mention that for `n <= 2`, the output should be `-1`, which is correctly handled by the code.
- For odd and even integers greater than `2`, the hints describe correct calculations of `m` and `k`.

### Edge Cases:
1. When `n = 1`, the program should output `-1`, which aligns with the requirement.
2. The syntax error in the print statements would lead to execution failure, thus making the program incorrect overall.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case due to the syntax error in the print statements. This means that it will not execute correctly, leading to undefined behavior. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to execute correctly due to syntax issues that prevent it from returning the expected output for valid inputs.
