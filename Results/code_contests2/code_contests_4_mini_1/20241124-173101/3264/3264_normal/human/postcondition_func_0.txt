The function reads an integer `n` from input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. For odd integers greater than 2, it prints two values: `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. For even integers greater than 2, it prints two values: `(n^2 / 4 - 1)` and `(n^2 / 4 + 1)`. However, the function does not return any value and has a syntax error in the print statement when `n` is 1 or 2, which would result in an error during execution. Therefore, the behavior for inputs 1 and 2 is undefined due to this syntax error.
