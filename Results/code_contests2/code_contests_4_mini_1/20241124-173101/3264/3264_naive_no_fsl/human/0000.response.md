Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for certain inputs, specifically for even integers greater than 2. The logic in the else branch for even `n` is incorrectly handling the calculation of the Pythagorean triple.

For example, if we take `n = 4`:
- According to the logic, it computes:
  - `m = n * n / 4 - 1` which results in `4` (since `4 * 4 / 4 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`)
  - `k = n * n / 4 + 1` which results in `5` (since `4 * 4 / 4 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5`)
  
This gives the output as `3 5`, which is incorrect because `3` is not a valid side of the triangle with `n = 4`.

Additionally, for other even integers, the calculations do not always yield valid Pythagorean triples. The program fails to cover all edge cases correctly, particularly for even integers where the logic does not hold. This invalidates the correctness of the solution as per the problem description.
