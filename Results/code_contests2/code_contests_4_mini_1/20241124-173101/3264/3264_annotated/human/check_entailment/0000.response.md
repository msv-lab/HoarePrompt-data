To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step. 

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` from input.
   
2. **Condition for n <= 2**: 
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the program outputs `-1`. This is correct because no Pythagorean triple can have a side length of 1 or 2.

3. **Odd n Case**: 
   - If `n` is odd (and greater than 2), the program calculates:
     - `m = (n * n - 1) / 2`
     - `k = (n * n + 1) / 2`
   - These values are derived from the Pythagorean theorem for odd integers, where \( n^2 + m^2 = k^2 \) holds true.

4. **Even n Case**: 
   - If `n` is even, it calculates:
     - `m = n * n / 4 - 1`
     - `k = n * n / 4 + 1`
   - This is also a valid method for generating Pythagorean triples where \( n \) is an even number.

### Edge Cases

- The program correctly handles the edge cases for inputs `1` and `2` by returning `-1`, which is aligned with the problem requirements.
- For inputs like `3`, `6`, `17`, and `67`, the calculations produce valid Pythagorean triples as shown in the provided examples.

### Conclusion

Since the program handles all cases as described, including edge cases, and generates valid Pythagorean triples for valid inputs while outputting `-1` for invalid cases, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
