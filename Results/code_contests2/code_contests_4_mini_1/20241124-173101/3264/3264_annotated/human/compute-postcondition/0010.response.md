The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with a positive integer `n`, which is constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, as there are no parameters passed directly to the function, we cannot describe any specific return values based on `n` without additional context or output information. Therefore, the functionality of the function func cannot be fully defined without further details on how `n` is utilized within the function. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. The functionality cannot be determined without additional output information regarding the usage of the positive integer n.**
