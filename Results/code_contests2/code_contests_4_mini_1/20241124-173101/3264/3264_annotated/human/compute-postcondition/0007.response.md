The code snippet calculates two expressions based on the variable `n`. The first expression is `n * n / 4 - 1`, and the second expression is `n * n / 4 + 1`. Since `n` is a positive even integer greater than 2, we can perform the calculations directly.

1. The value of `n * n / 4` is calculated first. Since `n` is even, `n * n` will also be even, and dividing by 4 gives an integer result. Letâ€™s denote `k = n * n / 4`.
2. The first expression evaluates to `k - 1`.
3. The second expression evaluates to `k + 1`.

Both expressions are printed as outputs. The previous values of `n` do not change, and the output state reflects the computed values based on `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer greater than 2, the first expression is `n * n / 4 - 1`, and the second expression is `n * n / 4 + 1`**.
