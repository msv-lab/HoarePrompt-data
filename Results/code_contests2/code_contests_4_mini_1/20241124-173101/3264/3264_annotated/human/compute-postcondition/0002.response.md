The code attempts to execute a `print` statement, but the syntax is incorrect, as `print - 1` is not a valid Python statement. The program does not change any values of the variables, and since the code does not execute properly, there is no output generated. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that has been updated based on user input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2, and no output is produced due to a syntax error.**
