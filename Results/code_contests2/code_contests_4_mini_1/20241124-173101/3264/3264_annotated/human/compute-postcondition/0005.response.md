The code calculates two expressions based on the value of `n`. The first expression is `(n * n - 1) / 2` and the second expression is `(n * n + 1) / 2`. 

1. The value of `n` is a positive odd integer greater than 2.
2. The first expression evaluates to `(n * n - 1) / 2`, which simplifies to `(n^2 - 1) / 2`.
3. The second expression evaluates to `(n * n + 1) / 2`, which simplifies to `(n^2 + 1) / 2`.

These expressions will be printed, but their calculation does not change the state of `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` remains unchanged and indicates the calculations performed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `n` is an odd integer; the expressions calculated are (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2**
