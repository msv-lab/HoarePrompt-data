Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, no output is produced due to a syntax error. If `n` is odd and greater than 2, the function prints the values of (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. If `n` is even and greater than 2, it prints the values of n * n / 4 - 1 and n * n / 4 + 1.***
