To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

The problem requires us to find two integers \( m \) and \( k \) such that \( n, m, k \) form a Pythagorean triple, given \( n \) as the length of one side of a right triangle. The program should also return -1 if no such integers exist.

Here's the analysis of the program:

```python
n = int(raw_input())
if n <= 2:
    print -1
elif n & 1:
    (print(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)
else:
    (print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \( n \).
2. **Check for Small Values**: 
   - If \( n \) is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. This is correct because for \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \), there are no Pythagorean triples.
3. **Odd Values of \( n \)**: 
   - If \( n \) is odd (`n & 1`), the program calculates:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \)
   - This is a correct formula for generating Pythagorean triples when \( n \) is odd.
4. **Even Values of \( n \)**: 
   - If \( n \) is even, it computes:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2}{4} - 1 \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2}{4} + 1 \)
   - This is also a valid way to generate Pythagorean triples when \( n \) is even.

However, there is a critical issue with how the program prints the results. The expressions used for \( m \) and \( k \) in the odd case are not correctly formatted for output. The use of parentheses around the `print` statement does not allow the values to be printed correctly as intended.

### Example of Failure:
- For an input where \( n = 3 \):
  - The expected output should be `4 5`, but due to the misplaced parentheses, the program will not print anything correctly.
- For an input where \( n = 6 \):
  - The expected output should be `8 10`, but the same issue will cause an incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to produce correct output for valid inputs due to improper use of print statements. Thus, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly print the output for valid Pythagorean triples, as shown in the failure case analysis.
