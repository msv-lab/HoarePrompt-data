According to the code, the loop will execute `N` times, where `i` will take on values from `0` to `N-1`. For the loop to execute, `N` must be at least `2`, which is already ensured by the provided state. 

At the beginning of the loop, `i` should start at `0`, which is the initial value of `i` in the range function. The other variables, `Q`, `S`, and `P`, do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself since the loop is only dependent on `N` for its range and the index variable `i`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be initialized to `0`.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 0**
