The value at index 0 of the list `P` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized with the first element as `0`, and `i` is `N`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized with the first element as `0`, and `i` is `N`**
