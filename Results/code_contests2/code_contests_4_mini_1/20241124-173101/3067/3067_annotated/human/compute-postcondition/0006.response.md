The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement following the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 0, and `P[0]` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
