The line of code `P[i] = P[i - 1]` assigns the value of `P[i - 1]` to `P[i]`. The value of `P[i]` will be the same as whatever `P[i - 1]` is, and since `P` was initialized with all elements set to 0, this means `P[i]` will also be 0. The other variables `N`, `Q`, `S`, and the condition regarding the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` being not equal to 'AC' are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, and `P[i]` is 0.**
