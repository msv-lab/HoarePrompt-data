The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceeds to the next iteration. However, since there are no further details about the loop structure or any specific code that follows, the current state of the variables remains unchanged.

The values of the variables do not change, and the `continue` statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects that we remain in the current loop iteration without any changes to the variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized with the first element as `0`, and `i` is `N` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
