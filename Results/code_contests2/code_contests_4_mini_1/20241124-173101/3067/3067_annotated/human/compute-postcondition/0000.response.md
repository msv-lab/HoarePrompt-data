The variables `N` and `Q` are assigned the values obtained from `raw_input()`, which accepts input and splits it into two integers. The previous values of `N` and `Q` are unknown but are constrained to be between specified limits. The state of other variables (`S`, `l_i`, and `r_i`) remains unaffected by this line. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000; `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000; `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000**
