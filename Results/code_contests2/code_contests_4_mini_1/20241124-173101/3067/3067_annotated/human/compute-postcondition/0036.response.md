The values of `l` and `r` are assigned based on the input provided by `raw_input()`, and then the expression `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` is printed. However, the values of `l` and `r` are unknown until input is received. The state of the list `P` remains unchanged during this process. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `l` and `r` are input integers, and we have the expression `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` ready to be printed but the actual values depend on the input.

Output State: **`P` is a list of length `N + 1`, `Q` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the expression `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` is printed.**
