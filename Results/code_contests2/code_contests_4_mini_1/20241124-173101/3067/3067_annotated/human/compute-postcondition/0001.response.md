The variable `S` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The initial values of `N` and `Q` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the impact of the assignment to `S`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000; `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000; `S` is an input string.**
