Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized to 0. If `i` is equal to 0, then `P[0]` remains 0 and the execution continues without any changes to `P[1]` to `P[N]`, and `i` is less than `N`. If `i` is greater than 0, there are no modifications made to `P` as the code does not handle such cases.***
