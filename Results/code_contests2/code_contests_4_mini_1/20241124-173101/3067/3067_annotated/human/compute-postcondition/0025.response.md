The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. Given that the initial state indicates no modifications are made to `P` if `i` is equal to 0 or if `i` is greater than 0, and since the code specifically states that `i` is less than `N`, we can conclude that the state of `P` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `P[0]` remains 0, and `P[1]` to `P[N]` are unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized to 0, and no modifications are made to `P` as `i` is either 0 or less than `N`.**
