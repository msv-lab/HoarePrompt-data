Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized to 0, and `i` is `N`. If `i` equals 0, then `P[0]` is set to 0, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `i` is not equal to 0, the state of `P` remains unchanged from its initialization.***
