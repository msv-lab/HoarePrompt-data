Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized to 0. If `i` is greater than 0 and the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` is updated to `P[i - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `P[i]` remains equal to `P[i - 1]`, ensuring `P[i]` does not exceed the count of 'AC' occurrences in the string `S`. Additionally, if `i` is 0, `P[0]` remains 0, and the program continues without affecting this initial value.***
