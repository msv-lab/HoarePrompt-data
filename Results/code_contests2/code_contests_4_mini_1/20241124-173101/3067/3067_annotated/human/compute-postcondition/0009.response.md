The value at index `i` of the list `P` is updated with the value of the previous index `P[i - 1]` incremented by 1. Given that `P` is initialized to 0 for all elements, `P[i - 1]` is also 0. Therefore, `P[i]` becomes 0 + 1, which equals 1. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with `P[i]` updated to 1, `i` is an integer greater than 0, and the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC'**.
