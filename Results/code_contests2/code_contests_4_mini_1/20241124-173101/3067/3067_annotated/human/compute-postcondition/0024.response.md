The variable `i` is checked against the condition. If `i` is equal to 0, then the assignment `P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1` does not execute, and `P[0]` remains 0. The other elements `P[1]` to `P[N]` are not affected. If `i` is greater than 0, there are no modifications made to `P` since the code does not handle such cases. Therefore, the output state is based on the initial state where `P[0]` is still 0, and no changes occur for `i = 0` or `i > 0`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized to 0, and there are no changes to `P` as `i` is either 0 or greater than 0.**
