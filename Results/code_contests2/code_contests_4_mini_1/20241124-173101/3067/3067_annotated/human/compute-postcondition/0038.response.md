According to the code, the loop will execute `Q` times. At the end of the last iteration, `Q` is 1, meaning the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, `Q` must be greater than 1. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `Q` to 2. The other states (`P`, `l`, and `r`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not affected by the loop control.

State: **`P` is a list of length `N + 1`, `Q` is 2, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the printed result is `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`**
