Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized to 0. If `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `N`, then if the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` equals 'AC', `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1] + 1`, otherwise `P[i]` remains equal to `P[i - 1]`. If `i` is equal to 0, `P[0]` remains 0 and there are no changes to `P[1]` to `P[N]`. If `i` is greater than `N`, no modifications are made to `P`.***
