Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized to 0. If `i` is equal to `N`, and the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is 'AC', then `P[N]` is assigned the value of `P[N - 1] + 1`. If `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is not 'AC', then `P[N]` is assigned the value of `P[N - 1]`, which remains unchanged from its initialization. In the case where `i` equals 0, `P[0]` is set to 0, and the loop continues without further modification to `P`. This ensures that `P[N]` reflects an accurate count based on the conditions evaluated.***
