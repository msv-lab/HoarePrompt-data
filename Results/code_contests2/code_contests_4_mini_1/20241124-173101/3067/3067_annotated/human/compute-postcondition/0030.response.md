The code assigns the values from `raw_input()` split into two integers to the variables `l` and `r`. The initial state specifies that `P` is a list and `Q` is greater than 0, but does not provide specific values for `l` and `r`. Therefore, `l` and `r` will be assigned values based on user input. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`P` is a list of length `N + 1`, `Q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are assigned values from user input.**
