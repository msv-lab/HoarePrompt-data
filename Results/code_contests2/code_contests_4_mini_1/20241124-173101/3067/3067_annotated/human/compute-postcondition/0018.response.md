The code assigns the value of `P[i - 1]` to `P[i]`. Since `i` is `N` and `N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `P[i]` will take the value of `P[N - 1]`. The list `P` was initialized to all zeros, so `P[N - 1]` is 0. Therefore, `P[N]` will also be 0 after the assignment. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with `P[N]` set to 0, and `i` is `N`**.
