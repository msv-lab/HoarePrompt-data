The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `Q`, and `S`. `N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, and `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` < `r_i` <= `N`. The function processes these inputs and returns results based on the given queries. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (2 to 100,000), an integer Q (1 to 100,000), and a string S of length N consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; it processes queries defined by pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) and returns results based on the specified conditions for these queries.**
