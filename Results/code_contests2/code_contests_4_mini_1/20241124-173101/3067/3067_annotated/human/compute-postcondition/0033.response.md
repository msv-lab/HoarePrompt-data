The variables `l` and `r` are assigned values from user input, where `map(int, raw_input().split())` converts the input into integers. The values of `l` and `r` will depend on what the user inputs. The other variables, `P` and `Q`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `l` and `r` based on user input.

Output State: **`P` is a list of length `N + 1`, `Q` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
