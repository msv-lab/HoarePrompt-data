According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to `N - 1`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be adjusted to reflect the next iteration. 

If `i` is currently at `N - 1`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be set to `N`. Since `i` is strictly less than `N` for the loop to execute, the state must also ensure that the loop can execute again by confirming that `i` is now equal to `N`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `N`, `Q`, `S`, and `P` remain unchanged in this context.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, `Q` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized to 0, `i` is N**
