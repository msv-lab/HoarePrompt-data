You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string S of length N consisting of `A`, `C`, `G` and `T`. Answer the following Q queries:

* Query i (1 \leq i \leq Q): You will be given integers l_i and r_i (1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N). Consider the substring of S starting at index l_i and ending at index r_i (both inclusive). In this string, how many times does `AC` occurs as a substring?

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq Q \leq 10^5
* S is a string of length N.
* Each character in S is `A`, `C`, `G` or `T`.
* 1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N Q
S
l_1 r_1
:
l_Q r_Q


Output

Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the answer to the i-th query.

Example

Input

8 3
ACACTACG
3 7
2 3
1 8


Output

2
0
3
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    N, Q = map(int, raw_input().split())
    S = raw_input()
    P = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(N):
        if i == 0:
            P[0] = 0
            continue
        
        if S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC':
            P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            P[i] = P[i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `P` is a list of length `N + 1` where `P[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in the string `S` from the start up to the index `i-1`. If `N` is at least 2, the loop will execute exactly `N` times. If `N` is less than 2, the loop will not execute, and `P` will remain initialized to all zeros. If `i` is greater than 0 and the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` will be `P[i - 1] + 1`; otherwise, `P[i]` will be equal to `P[i - 1]`. Specifically, `P[0]` will always be 0, and the values of `P[1]` to `P[N]` will depend on the occurrences of 'AC' in the string `S`.
    for _ in range(Q):
        l, r = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        print(P[r - 1] - P[l - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `P` is a list of length `N + 1`, containing the cumulative counts of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in `S`. If `N` is at least 2, the loop executes `Q` times, where `Q` is greater than 0, and `l` and `r` are assigned values from user input. The printed result is the difference `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`. If `N` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `P` remains initialized to all zeros, with `Q` being 0 or less, `l` and `r` are unassigned or may lead to out-of-bounds access if user input is not validated.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
