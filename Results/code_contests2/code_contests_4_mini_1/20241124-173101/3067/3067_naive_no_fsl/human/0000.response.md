Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the query for counting the occurrences of the substring `AC` in the specified range. The issue arises from the way the prefix sum array `P` is constructed. 

1. The prefix sum array `P` is intended to store the cumulative counts of `AC` up to each index. However, the way the indices are being accessed in the print statement during the query handling is incorrect. Specifically, the code uses `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`, which does not account for the fact that the substring defined by the range `(l, r)` is inclusive. Therefore, it fails to include the count of `AC` that could occur at the boundary indices.

2. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   5 1
   ACACG
   1 5
   ```
   The expected output should be `2`, as `AC` appears twice in the whole string. However, the program will compute it based on the prefix sums and could incorrectly output `1` since it only counts `AC` up to the last character at index 4 (`P[4]`), missing the last `AC` starting at index 3.

This demonstrates a case where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
