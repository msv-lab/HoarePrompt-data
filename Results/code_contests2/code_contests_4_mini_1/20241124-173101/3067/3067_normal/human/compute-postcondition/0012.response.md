Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `S` is a non-empty string. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` is set to 1, resulting in `P` being `[1, 0, 0, ..., 0]`. Otherwise, `P[i]` remains 0, maintaining `P` as `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]`, where `P[0]` is 0 and all other elements are also 0.***
