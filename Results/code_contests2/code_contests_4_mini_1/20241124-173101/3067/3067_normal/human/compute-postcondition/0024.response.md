The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is 2, the code updates `P[2]` to be `P[1] + 1`. The value of `P[1]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `P[2]`. The states of `N` and `S` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `S` is a non-empty string, and `P[2]` is updated to `P[1] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `S` is a non-empty string, and `P[2]` is updated to `P[1] + 1**
