The function `func` accepts a parameter `S`, which is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', where `N` is between 2 and 100,000. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `Q`, which is a positive integer such that `Q` is between 1 and 100,000. Each query consists of two integers, `l_i` and `r_i`, satisfying the condition that `1 <= l_i < r_i <= N`.

The output of the function is based on the queries. It processes each query and returns the counts of specific characters ('A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') in the substring defined by the indices `l_i` and `r_i` for each query.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S and a positive integer Q, and for each query defined by (l_i, r_i), it returns the counts of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the substring S[l_i-1:r_i].**
