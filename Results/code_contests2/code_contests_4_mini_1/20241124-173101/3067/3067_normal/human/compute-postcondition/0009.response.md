In the initial state, we have `N` greater than 0, `i` is 0, `S` is a non-empty string, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` where `P[0]` is set to 0, and all other elements are initially zeros. The substring from `S` starting at index `i - 1` and ending at index `i + 1` is equal to 'AC'. 

The code `P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1` will now be evaluated. Since `i` is 0, we need to access `P[i - 1]`, which is `P[-1]`. In Python, negative indexing accesses elements from the end of a list, so `P[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `P`, which is `0` because all elements were initially set to zeros except for `P[0]`.

Thus, `P[i]` or `P[0]` will be updated as follows:
- `P[0] = P[-1] + 1`
- This means `P[0] = 0 + 1`, resulting in `P[0]` being updated to `1`.

The other elements in `P` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `N` is greater than 0,
- `i` is 0,
- `S` is a non-empty string,
- `P` is now `[1, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (with N zeros after the initial 1).

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `S` is a non-empty string, `P` is now `[1, 0, 0, ..., 0]`**
