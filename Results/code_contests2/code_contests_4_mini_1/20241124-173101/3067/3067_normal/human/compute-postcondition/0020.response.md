According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. The value of `N` does not need to be changed as it already satisfies the condition of being greater than 1.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `S` is a non-empty string.**
