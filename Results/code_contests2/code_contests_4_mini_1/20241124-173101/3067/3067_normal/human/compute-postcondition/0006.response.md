The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `S` is a non-empty string, `P` is a list where `P[0]` is 0 and the rest of the elements remain zeros, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
