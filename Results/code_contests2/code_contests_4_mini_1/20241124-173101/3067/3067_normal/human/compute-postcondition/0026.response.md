Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `S` is a non-empty string. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is 'AC', then `P[2]` is updated to `P[1] + 1`. Otherwise, `P[2]` retains the value of `P[1]`. In all cases, `P[2]` is either incremented by 1 or unchanged based on the presence of 'AC' in the specified substring.***
