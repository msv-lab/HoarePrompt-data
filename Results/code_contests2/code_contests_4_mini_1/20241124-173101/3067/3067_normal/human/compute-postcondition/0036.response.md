The values of `l` and `r` are assigned from the input, which are two integers provided by the user. The previous values of `Q` and `P` are not affected by this assignment. The output of the print statement remains unchanged as 0. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `Q` and `P`, along with the newly assigned values of `l` and `r`.

Output State: **`Q` is greater than 2, `P` is a list of zeros with `P[0]` being 0, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the output of the print statement is 0**.
