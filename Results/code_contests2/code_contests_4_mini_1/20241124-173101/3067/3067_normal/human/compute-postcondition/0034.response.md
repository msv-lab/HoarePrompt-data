The code prints the result of the expression `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`. The variable `P` is a list of zeros, with `P[0]` being 0, which means every element of `P` is 0. Therefore, `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` will both be 0 regardless of the values of `l` and `r`, as long as they are valid indices given that `Q` is greater than 1.

The expression evaluates to `0 - 0`, which is `0`. The output state will not change the values of variables, but will reflect that the print statement outputs `0`.

Output State: **`Q` is greater than 1, `P` is a list of zeros with `P[0]` being 0, `l` and `r` are input integers, and the output of the print statement is 0.**
