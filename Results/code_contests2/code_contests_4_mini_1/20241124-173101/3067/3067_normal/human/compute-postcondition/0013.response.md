According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If `N` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `N` is greater than 0, which indicates that the loop can execute at least once more. 

Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration (as dictated by the for loop), for the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `N` must be greater than `1` (so that `i` can be less than `N`).

No other states need to be adjusted in this case. 

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `S` is a non-empty string**
