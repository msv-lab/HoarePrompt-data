The values of `l` and `r` are assigned values from the input, which are mapped to integers. The initial state only specifies that `Q` is greater than 0 and `P` is a list of zeros with `P[0]` being 0. However, the values of `l` and `r` are not defined in the initial state, as they will be provided through user input. Thus, the output state reflects that `l` and `r` are now assigned input integers.

Output State: **`Q` is greater than 0, `P` is a list of zeros with `P[0]` being 0, `l` and `r` are input integers**
