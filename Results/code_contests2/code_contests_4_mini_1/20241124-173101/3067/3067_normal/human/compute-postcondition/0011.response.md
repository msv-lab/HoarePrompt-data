The statement `P[i] = P[i - 1]` assigns the value of `P[i - 1]` to `P[i]`. Given that `P` is initialized with `P[0]` set to 0 and all other elements remaining zeros, `P[i - 1]` will be 0. Therefore, after the execution of this line, `P[i]` will also be set to 0. The value of `N`, `i`, `S`, and the condition regarding the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `S` is a non-empty string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` where `P[0]` is 0 and `P[i]` is 0**
