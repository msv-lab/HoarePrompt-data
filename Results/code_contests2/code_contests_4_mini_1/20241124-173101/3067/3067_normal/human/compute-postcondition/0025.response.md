The code assigns the value of `P[i - 1]` to `P[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, the operation will assign `P[1]` to `P[2]`. The initial state indicates that `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `S` is a non-empty string, but does not provide any specific values for `P`. 

Since `P[0]` is not affected by this line of code, and the value of `P` at index 1 is required to determine the new value for `P[2]`, we cannot specify what `P[2]` becomes without knowing the value of `P[1]`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `P[i]` is updated based on the value of `P[i - 1]`, but we cannot specify the exact values of the variables without knowing the contents of `P`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `S` is a non-empty string; `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1]`**
