The assignment `P[i] = P[i - 1]` assigns the value of `P[i - 1]` to `P[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `P[1]` will be assigned the value of `P[0]`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `P[0]`, but it does indicate that `P[0]` is not modified as `i` is not equal to 0 in this case. Therefore, the output state reflects that `P[1]` is now equal to whatever value `P[0]` held before this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `S` is a non-empty string, and `P[1]` is now equal to `P[0]`**
