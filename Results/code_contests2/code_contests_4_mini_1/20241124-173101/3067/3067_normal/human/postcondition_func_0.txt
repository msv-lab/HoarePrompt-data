The function reads input values `N` and `Q`, constructs a list that counts occurrences of the substring 'AC' in the string `S`, and prints the count of 'AC' occurrences in the specified ranges for each query. It does not count characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' individually and does not handle the edge case of `N` or `Q` being zero correctly.
