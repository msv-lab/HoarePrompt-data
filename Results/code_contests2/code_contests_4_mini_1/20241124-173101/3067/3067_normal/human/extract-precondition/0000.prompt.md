You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given a string S of length N consisting of `A`, `C`, `G` and `T`. Answer the following Q queries:

* Query i (1 \leq i \leq Q): You will be given integers l_i and r_i (1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N). Consider the substring of S starting at index l_i and ending at index r_i (both inclusive). In this string, how many times does `AC` occurs as a substring?

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq Q \leq 10^5
* S is a string of length N.
* Each character in S is `A`, `C`, `G` or `T`.
* 1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N Q
S
l_1 r_1
:
l_Q r_Q


Output

Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the answer to the i-th query.

Example

Input

8 3
ACACTACG
3 7
2 3
1 8


Output

2
0
3
Program:
```

def func():
    (N, Q) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    S = raw_input()
    P = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(N):
        if i == 0:
            P[0] = 0
            continue
        if S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC':
            P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            P[i] = P[i - 1]
    for _ in range(Q):
        (l, r) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        print(P[r - 1] - P[l - 1])
```
