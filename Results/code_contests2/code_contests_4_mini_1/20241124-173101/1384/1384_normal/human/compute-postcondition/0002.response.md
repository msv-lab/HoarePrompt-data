The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\) and `X` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq 100\). The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional detail on the output based on the internal logic of the function, we cannot describe its functionality accurately. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters; the output is dependent on internal logic not specified in the provided information.**
