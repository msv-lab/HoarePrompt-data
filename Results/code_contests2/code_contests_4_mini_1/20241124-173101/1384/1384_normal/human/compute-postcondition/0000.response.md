The variables `t` and `x` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which is split into two parts and converted to float. The initial state indicates that `T` and `X` are positive integers within the specified range, but after the operation, `t` and `x` will now be floating-point numbers based on user input. The original values of `T` and `X` are not retained in `t` and `x` since they are converted to floats. Therefore, the output state acknowledges that `t` and `x` are now floats based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is a float from user input, `x` is a float from user input**
