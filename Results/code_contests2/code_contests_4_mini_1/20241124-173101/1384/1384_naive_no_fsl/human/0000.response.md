Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly handles the input values because it uses `map(float, input().split())`, which converts the input values to floats. However, according to the problem description, both T and X are supposed to be integers. This can lead to mismatches in expectations regarding the input type.

For instance, if the input is `8 3`, the program will correctly compute `8 / 3` and output `2.6666666667`. However, if the input were `8.0 3.0`, which might be an acceptable input if floats were considered, it would still yield the same result, but it would not be handling the integers as specified by the problem constraints.

Additionally, since the problem states that "the output will be regarded as correct when its absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-3}", the program needs to ensure that the output format respects this precision requirement. However, it does not explicitly format the output to match that precision, which can lead to discrepancies.

Thus, the program does not adhere strictly to the problem description's constraints regarding input types and output formatting. Therefore, it is incorrect.
