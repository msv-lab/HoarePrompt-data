Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not correctly handle the constraints outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the program uses `float` for input values, which is unnecessary and could lead to inaccuracies in integer division.

For example, consider the input:

```
T = 8
X = 3
```

The expected output is `2.6666666667`, which is correct if the calculation `t / x` is performed. However, if we consider inputs like:

```
T = 99
X = 1
```

The output should be `99.0000000000`, and the program will handle this correctly since `99 / 1` equals `99`.

However, an edge case arises when `T` is `1` and `X` is `100`. The expected output would be `0.0100000000`, which will also be handled correctly by the program since `1 / 100` equals `0.01`.

Nonetheless, if the program is used with non-integer inputs (which are not specified in the constraints), it could lead to unexpected behavior because the problem specifically states that all values must be integers. Thus, while the program may seem to work for the provided examples, it does not enforce the integer constraint and could fail in untested cases where floats are introduced as input.

Also, the output precision requirements (absolute or relative error from the judge's output at most 10^-3) are not explicitly checked in the code, which could lead to discrepancies. 

Therefore, since the program does not ensure handling of the input constraints correctly, it is deemed incorrect.
