Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user for two space-separated floating-point numbers. It calculates and prints the result of dividing the first number (t) by the second number (x). The function does not handle cases where x is zero, which would lead to a division by zero error. Additionally, the constraints mentioned in the annotations about t and x being positive integers are not enforced in the code.**
