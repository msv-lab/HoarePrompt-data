The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with two constraints: `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\) and `X` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq 100\). The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is that it relies on the internal logic or state defined by the constraints on `T` and `X`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraints that T is a positive integer (1 to 100) and X is a positive integer (1 to 100). The return value is not specified.**
