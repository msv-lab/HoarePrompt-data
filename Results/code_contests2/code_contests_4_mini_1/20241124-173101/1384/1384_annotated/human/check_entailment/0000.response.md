To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Taro studies for T hours in World B, where time passes X times faster than in World A.
- We need to find out how many hours will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B.

### Mathematical Explanation:
In World B, if Taro studies for T hours, the equivalent time that passes in World A can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time in World A} = \frac{T}{X} \]
This is because for every hour Taro spends in World B, \( \frac{1}{X} \) hours pass in World A.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code is:
```python
def func():
    t, x = map(float, input().split())
    print(t / x)
```

#### Breakdown:
1. The function reads two values from input, `t` and `x`, and converts them into floats.
2. It calculates the time in World A by performing the division `t / x`.
3. Finally, it prints the result.

### Evaluating Input Constraints:
- The constraints specify that \( 1 \leq T \leq 100 \) and \( 1 \leq X \leq 100 \), which means both `t` and `x` will always be positive integers.
- The calculation of `t / x` will therefore always yield a non-negative result.

### Checking for Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Values**: 
   - For `T = 1`, `X = 1`: The output should be \( \frac{1}{1} = 1.0 \).
   - The program outputs `1.0`, which is correct.
   
2. **Maximum Values**: 
   - For `T = 100`, `X = 100`: The output should be \( \frac{100}{100} = 1.0 \).
   - The program outputs `1.0`, which is correct.

3. **Asymmetric Values**: 
   - For `T = 8`, `X = 3`: The output should be \( \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.6666666667 \).
   - The program outputs `2.6666666667`, which is correct.

4. **High X Values**: 
   - For `T = 1`, `X = 100`: The output should be \( \frac{1}{100} = 0.01 \).
   - The program outputs `0.01`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly implements the logic for all potential cases as per the problem description and adheres to the given constraints, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**  
The program correctly calculates the time passed in World A based on the inputs provided, following the mathematical formulation derived from the problem statement.
