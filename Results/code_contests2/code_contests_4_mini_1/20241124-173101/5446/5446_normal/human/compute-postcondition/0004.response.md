Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers, n, b, and c, which are read from user input. It computes a value based on the maximum and minimum of b and c, and then calculates and prints the ceiling of the result of the minimum value divided by n, multiplied by the computed ratio. However, it lacks error handling for cases where n is zero, which would lead to a division by zero error. Therefore, the function's behavior is undefined if n is zero. **
