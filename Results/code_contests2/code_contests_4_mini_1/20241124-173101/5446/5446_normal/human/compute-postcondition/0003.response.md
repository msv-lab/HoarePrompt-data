The function `func` accepts no parameters directly, but it operates based on the constraints that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers. Specifically, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), where `a` and `b` represent the number of pieces of the first and second cake respectively, with \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\). The function likely processes these values to determine the distribution of cake pieces or some related outcome based on the provided conditions.

However, since the exact output based on the parameters is not specified in the provided details, we can't explicitly state the return values. 

Functionality: **The function operates on the integers n, a, and b, where n is constrained by the sum of a and b, and returns a result based on these values.**
