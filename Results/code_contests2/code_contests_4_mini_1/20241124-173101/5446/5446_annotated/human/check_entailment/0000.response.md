To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description carefully.

### Problem Breakdown
The goal is to distribute pieces of two cakes among `n` plates such that:
1. Each piece of each cake is put on some plate.
2. Each plate contains at least one piece of cake.
3. No plate contains pieces of both cakes.

We want to maximize the minimum number of pieces on any plate after this distribution.

### Annotations Review
The provided annotations state that the program calculates the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate contains at least `x` pieces of cake. However, the code logic needs to be analyzed to see if it adheres to the problem requirements.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func():
    n, b, c = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))
    print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers from input: `n`, `b`, and `c`, which correspond to the number of plates, number of pieces of the first cake, and number of pieces of the second cake respectively.

2. **Logic Explanation**:
   - The line `x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` calculates a ratio of the maximum pieces of one cake to the minimum pieces of the other. This does not align with the requirement of distributing pieces to maximize the minimum pieces on any plate.
   - The line `print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))` attempts to calculate the minimum pieces per plate using the ratio `x`, but this approach does not accurately consider the constraints of how the pieces can be distributed.

### Potential Edge Case
Consider the input: 
```
n = 2, b = 1, c = 1
```
In this case:
- We have 2 plates and only 1 piece of each cake.
- The expected output should be 1 because we can place 1 piece of cake on each plate.
  
However, the code will evaluate:
- `x = max(1, 1) / float(min(1, 1))` which results in `x = 1.0`.
- Then it calculates `int(ceil(min(1, 1) / float(2) * 1))` which results in `int(ceil(0.5))`, leading to an output of `0`.

This demonstrates that the program does not handle this input correctly as it violates the requirement that each plate should have at least one piece.

### Conclusion
Due to the misunderstanding of the distribution logic and the failure to handle specific edge cases correctly, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
