Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters directly, but it reads three integers from user input: `n`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates the ratio of the maximum of `b` and `c` to the minimum of `b` and `c`, and then computes and prints the ceiling of the result of multiplying this ratio by the fraction of the minimum of `b` and `c` divided by `n`. The function assumes that `n` is at least 2 and the sum of `a` and `b` is at least `n`, although `a` is not explicitly defined in the parameters. Edge cases include situations where the minimum of `b` and `c` is less than `n`, which could affect the final computation.**
