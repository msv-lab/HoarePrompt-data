The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly as it is defined without any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that there are two integers `a` and `b`, which are both required to be in the range of 1 to 100. Additionally, there is an integer `n` that must satisfy the condition of being at least 2 and at most equal to the sum of `a` and `b`. 

Since the output specifics are not provided in the prompt, we cannot delineate the return values or cases. If we assume that the function operates based on the stated constraints, we can summarize its intended functionality.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates based on the integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100) and an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), returning a value based on these constraints.**
