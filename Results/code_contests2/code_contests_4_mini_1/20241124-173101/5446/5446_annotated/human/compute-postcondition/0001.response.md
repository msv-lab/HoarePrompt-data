To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet along with the initial conditions.

1. The initial state indicates that `b` and `c` are assigned values from input, which means their specific values are unknown at this point.
2. The expression `max(b, c)` will yield the larger of the two input values `b` and `c`.
3. The expression `min(b, c)` will yield the smaller of the two input values `b` and `c`.
4. The division `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` will then calculate the ratio of the maximum value to the minimum value, converting the minimum value to a float for accurate division.

Since the values of `b` and `c` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of the expression. However, we can describe the state of the variables after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100; `b` and `c` are assigned values from input; `x` is max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))**
