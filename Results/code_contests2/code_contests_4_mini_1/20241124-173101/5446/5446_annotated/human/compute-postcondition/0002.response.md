To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and the initial conditions:

1. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, and `a` and `b` are integers where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100`. Additionally, `b` and `c` are assigned values from input, and `x` is calculated as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`.

2. The code provided is:
   ```python
   print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))
   ```

3. The output of this code will depend on the values of `b`, `c`, and `n`. Since `b` and `c` are assigned from input, we will assume they have values that satisfy the constraints given in the initial state.

4. The function uses the `min(b, c)` and `max(b, c)` to compute `x`. Then, it divides `min(b, c)` by `n`, multiplies by `x`, and applies `ceil` to the result before converting it to an integer.

5. The specific values of `b`, `c`, and `n` are unknown but are within the constraints mentioned. 

Given that we don't know the exact values of `b`, `c`, and `n`, the output will generally represent the calculated result based on those operations without specific numerical values.

Output State: **The output is the integer result of ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * (max(b, c) / float(min(b, c)))) based on the values of b, c, and n within the specified ranges.**
