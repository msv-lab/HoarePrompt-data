Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. 

Here's why it is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect variable names**: The variables `b` and `c` in the line `(n, b, c)` are likely misnamed; they should correspond to the number of pieces of the first and second cakes respectively, but it seems that they are being treated incorrectly.

2. **Logic flaw**: The computation of `x` as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` does not align with the requirement of distributing the pieces across the plates while ensuring that each plate has at least one piece and no plate has pieces from both cakes.

3. **Division and distribution**: The formula used does not take into account the proper distribution of pieces across plates, especially in scenarios where the number of pieces does not evenly divide among the plates. For instance, if `n` is greater than the number of pieces of either cake, the program could yield misleading results.

4. **Edge case**: For example, consider the input `3 5 3`. The expected output is `2` because you can have one plate with 2 pieces of the first cake, one plate with 2 pieces of the first cake, and one plate with 1 piece of the second cake. However, the provided code would not handle this correctly.

Due to these issues, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
