The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters as per the provided definition. However, it is implied that the function operates on a set of variables related to trolleybuses, including `n`, `a`, `d`, `ti`, and `vi`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses.
- `a` is a positive integer representing a specific parameter related to the trolleybuses.
- `d` is a positive integer representing another specific parameter related to the trolleybuses.
- `ti` are non-negative integers representing the departure times of the trolleybuses, which are ordered such that \(0 \leq t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_n \leq 10^6\).
- `vi` are positive integers representing the maximum speeds of the trolleybuses, where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^6\).

The output of the function is not explicitly stated, but based on the context, it likely involves calculations or determinations related to the trolleybuses' departure times and speeds.

Functionality: **The function operates on a set of parameters related to trolleybuses, including the number of trolleybuses, their departure times, and maximum speeds, but does not explicitly accept parameters. The specific output is not detailed.**
