Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), `d` is a positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6), `ti` are non-negative integers representing the departure times of the trolleybuses, `vi` are positive integers representing the maximum speeds of the trolleybuses, such that 1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6 and 0 ≤ t1 < t2 < ... < tn ≤ 10^6; `t` is assigned the value 0.0, and `n`, `a`, `d` are now assigned values from user input.**
