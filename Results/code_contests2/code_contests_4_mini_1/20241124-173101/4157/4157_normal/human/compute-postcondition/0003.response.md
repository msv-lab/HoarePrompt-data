The variables `ti` and `v` are assigned values based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which gets split into two parts and converted to floats. The initial values of `n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, and `i` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged initial values along with the new variables `ti` and `v` being assigned floating-point numbers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0, `ti` is a float from input, `v` is a float from input**
