Output State: **`t` is the maximum time calculated from the trolleybus departure times and the time taken to reach the destination based on their speeds and acceleration for each of the `n` trolleybuses. If the loop executes at least once, `t` will be updated to the maximum of the calculated time plus `ti` and the previous value of `t`. If `n` is 0 (though it must be at least 1 as per the conditions), the loop does not execute and `t` remains 0.0. In all cases, `i` will range from 0 to n-1 during the loop execution, while `ti` and `v` will be floats read from input for each trolleybus.**
