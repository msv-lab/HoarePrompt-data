The value of `t1` is assigned based on the condition of `d` compared to `v * v / (2 * a)`. If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` will be calculated using the formula `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`. Otherwise, `t1` will be assigned the value of `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`. The variables `n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, `i`, `ti`, and `v` remain unchanged in this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the computed value of `t1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either 0.0 or max(t1 + ti, 0.0), `i` is 1, `ti` is a float from input, `v` is a float from input, and `t1` is either calculated using v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v or as math.sqrt(2 * d / a)**
