The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned from the input, which will be two floats. The previous values of `n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, `i`, and `t1` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either 0.0 or max(t1 + ti, 0.0), `i` is 1, `ti` is a float from input, `v` is a float from input, and `t1` is either v/a + (d - v*v/(2*a))/v or sqrt(2*d/a).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either 0.0 or max(t1 + ti, 0.0), `i` is 1, `ti` is a float from input, `v` is a float from input, and `t1` is either v/a + (d - v*v/(2*a))/v or sqrt(2*d/a)**
