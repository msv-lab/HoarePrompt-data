Functionality: ** The function reads input for the number of trolleybuses, their departure times, and maximum speeds, then calculates the maximum time taken to reach a destination based on the trolleybuses' speeds and acceleration. It prints the maximum time for each trolleybus processed. However, it does not handle cases where no trolleybuses are provided (n = 0), which would lead to an error since the loop is expected to execute at least once. Therefore, if no trolleybuses are input, the function will not produce any output and may raise an error due to the absence of necessary input values. **
