According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the positive integer `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, it must be at least 1 to allow for another iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented from 0 to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted because the values of `n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, `ti`, `v`, and `t1` do not change based on the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either 0.0 or max(t1 + ti, 0.0), `i` is 1, `ti` is a float from input, `v` is a float from input, and `t1` is either v/a + (d - v*v/(2*a))/v or sqrt(2*d/a)**
