The variable `t1` is assigned a value based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`. 

1. The condition checks if `d > v * v / (2 * a)`.
2. If true, `t1` is calculated as:
   - \( t1 = \frac{v}{a} + \frac{d - \frac{v^2}{2a}}{v} \)
3. If false, `t1` is calculated as:
   - \( t1 = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{a}} \)

Since `n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, `i`, `ti`, and `v` are all positive integers or floats, the exact value of `t1` will depend on the specific input values of `a`, `d`, and `v`. However, the other variables `n`, `t`, `i`, and `ti` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0, `ti` is a float from input, `v` is a float from input, and `t1` is either calculated as v/a + (d - v*v/(2*a))/v or as sqrt(2*d/a) based on the condition.**
