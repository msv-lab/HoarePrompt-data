Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), d is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6), and for each trolleybus, ti is a non-negative floating-point number representing the time it leaves the depot (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) and vi is a positive floating-point number representing its maximum speed (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6), with the condition that the times ti are in strictly increasing order.**
