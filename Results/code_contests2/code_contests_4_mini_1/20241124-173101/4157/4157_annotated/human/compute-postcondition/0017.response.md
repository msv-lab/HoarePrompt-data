According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `n` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to run for `i` equal to 3, and `i` will become 3 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is updated to max(t1 + ti, t), `i` is 3, `ti` is an input float, `v` is an input float**
