The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 
- `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `a`, which is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6).
- `d`, which is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6).
- For each trolleybus, `ti`, which is a non-negative floating-point number representing the time it leaves the depot (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6).
- `vi`, which is a positive floating-point number representing its maximum speed (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6), with the condition that the times `ti` are in strictly increasing order.

The function processes these inputs and returns values based on the conditions related to the trolleybuses' acceleration, speed, and timing in relation to the distance to the final station. However, the specific return values are not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, d, a list of non-negative floating-point numbers ti representing departure times, and a list of positive floating-point numbers vi representing maximum speeds of trolleybuses, and it evaluates conditions related to their travel to a final station.**
