The code snippet assigns values to the variables `n`, `a`, and `d` using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes input from the user, splits it into separate values, and converts them to integers. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are overwritten by the input values. The state of `t` and any other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses, `a` is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses, `d` is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station, `t` is 0.0, and `n`, `a`, `d` are now assigned new input integer values**.
