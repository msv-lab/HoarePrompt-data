The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned the results of `map(float, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input()` accepts input and `map(float, ...)` converts the split input values to floats. The initial values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `ti` and `v` as inputs while the rest of the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0, `ti` is an input float, `v` is an input float**
