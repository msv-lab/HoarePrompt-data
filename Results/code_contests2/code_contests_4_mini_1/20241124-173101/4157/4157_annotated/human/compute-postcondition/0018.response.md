Output State: **`t` is the maximum of all computed values of `t1 + ti` for each iteration, where `ti` and `v` are input floats for each trolleybus, `n` is the number of trolleybuses, `a` is the maximum acceleration, and `d` is the distance to the final station. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `t` remains 0.0. If `d` is less than or equal to 0, the calculation for `t1` may lead to potential errors or unexpected results without proper handling, so the logic should ensure that `d` is positive.**
