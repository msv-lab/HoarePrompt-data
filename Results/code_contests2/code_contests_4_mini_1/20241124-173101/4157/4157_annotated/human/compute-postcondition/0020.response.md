Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of trolleybuses, an integer `a` for maximum acceleration, and an integer `d` for the distance to the final station. It computes the maximum travel time for each trolleybus based on their departure times and maximum speeds. The function handles the case where `d` is positive but does not account for cases where `n` is 0, leading to no computations and leaving `t` as 0.0. Additionally, if `d` is less than or equal to 0, the calculations for `t1` could produce misleading results due to the lack of error handling for such scenarios. The output is the maximum calculated travel time printed for each trolleybus iteration.**
