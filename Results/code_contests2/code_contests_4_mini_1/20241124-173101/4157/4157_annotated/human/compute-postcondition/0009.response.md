The value of `t1` is calculated based on the given formula. The formula checks if `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`. Depending on this condition, either the first part `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v` is executed or the second part `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)` is executed. The new value of `t` is then assigned to be the maximum of `t1 + ti` and `0.0`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the computed values of `t1` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is the maximum of `t1 + ti` and 0.0, `i` is 1, `ti` is an input float, `v` is an input float, and the function prints `t`.**
