According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses, and it is given that `n` is a positive integer, the loop should execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 for its first iteration.

At the start of the loop, `t` is 0.0, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned new input integer values. Since `n` is a positive integer, it is sufficient for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0**
