The variables `ti` and `v` are assigned the values from `raw_input().split()`, which are then converted to floats. The initial state indicates that `ti` is being updated with an input float value, and `v` is also being updated with an input float value. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, `i`) remain unchanged. Since the function subsequently prints `t`, it does not modify the state of `t`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is the maximum of `t1 + ti` and 0.0, `i` is 2, `ti` is an input float, `v` is an input float, and the function prints `t`.**
