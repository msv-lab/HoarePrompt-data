Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not account for the scenario where trolleybuses catch up to each other. It calculates the time for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on its maximum speed and acceleration but fails to consider that if one trolleybus catches up to another, they must travel together at the speed of the faster trolleybus after the point of catch-up.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2 10 100
0 10
5 5
```

Here, the first trolleybus leaves at time `0` with a maximum speed of `10`, while the second trolleybus leaves at time `5` with a maximum speed of `5`. 

1. The first trolleybus will reach the station at a calculated time of `1000.5` seconds (as it can accelerate to its maximum speed).
2. The second trolleybus, however, will reach its maximum speed slower and would not catch the first trolleybus until after it has already left the depot, meaning it will travel slower and arrive later than the first.

The program does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to incorrect output for the times of arrival for both trolleybuses. Thus, the program is incorrect.
