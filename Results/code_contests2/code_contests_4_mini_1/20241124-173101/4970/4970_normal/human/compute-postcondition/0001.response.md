The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with a predefined constraint that a non-negative integer `a` must be within the range of 0 to 15. However, since the function does not take `a` as an input parameter, it likely uses `a` internally or relies on external context to determine its value. The output behavior of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional information on the return value, I cannot provide a detailed description of the output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with a non-negative integer `a` in the range of 0 to 15, but the specific output behavior is not defined.**
