Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and prints an element from a predefined list based on the user's input. The input must be a non-negative integer between 0 and 15 inclusive, as it is used as an index to access the list. If the input is outside this range, an `IndexError` will occur, resulting in an error instead of a defined output. **
