To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program and check if it meets the requirements stated.

**Problem description:** The program should take a single integer `a` (0 ≤ a ≤ 15) as input and output a single integer according to the specified mapping.

The program provided is:
```python
print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

### Analysis:
1. The program uses a list to map the input integer `a` to a corresponding output value.
2. The input is taken using `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2.x. If this program were to be run in Python 3.x, `raw_input()` would need to be replaced with `input()`.
3. The list is indexed directly with the integer value of `a`, which should be within the range of 0 to 15 inclusive to avoid an `IndexError`. The list has 16 elements (indices 0 to 15) which are:
   - Index 0: 15
   - Index 1: 14
   - Index 2: 12
   - Index 3: 13
   - Index 4: 8
   - Index 5: 9
   - Index 6: 10
   - Index 7: 11
   - Index 8: 0
   - Index 9: 1
   - Index 10: 2
   - Index 11: 3
   - Index 12: 4
   - Index 13: 5
   - Index 14: 6
   - Index 15: 7

### Edge Cases:
- If the input `a` is less than 0 or greater than 15, the program would raise an `IndexError`, demonstrating that it does not handle out-of-bounds inputs properly.
- The problem description does not specify how to handle invalid inputs; if the input is outside the specified range, it should ideally return an error message or a specific output.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle inputs outside the range of 0 to 15, which makes it incorrect. Thus, there are potential cases where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**.
