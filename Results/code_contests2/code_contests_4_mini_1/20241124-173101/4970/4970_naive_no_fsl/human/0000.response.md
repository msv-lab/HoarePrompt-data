Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to take an integer input `a` (0 ≤ a ≤ 15) and return the corresponding value from a predefined list. The list is defined as:

```python
[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

The program uses `int(raw_input())` to read the input, which is valid in Python 2 but outdated. However, the main issue arises from the logic of the output values corresponding to the input.

Let's analyze the output for various inputs:

- For input `0`, the output is `15`.
- For input `1`, the output is `14`.
- For input `2`, the output is `12`.
- For input `3`, the output is `13`.
- For input `4`, the output is `8`.
- For input `5`, the output is `9`.
- For input `6`, the output is `10`.
- For input `7`, the output is `11`.
- For input `8`, the output is `0`.
- For input `9`, the output is `1`.
- For input `10`, the output is `2`.
- For input `11`, the output is `3`.
- For input `12`, the output is `4`.
- For input `13`, the output is `5`.
- For input `14`, the output is `6`.
- For input `15`, the output is `7`.

The problem description includes the example input of `3`, which correctly outputs `13`. However, if we consider the program's logic, it does not handle cases where the input is outside the specified range (0 to 15). Specifically:

1. If the input is `-1`, the program will throw an `IndexError` because there is no valid index.
2. If the input is `16`, the program will also throw an `IndexError` for the same reason.

Therefore, since the program fails to handle inputs that are valid in terms of the problem description constraints (0 ≤ a ≤ 15), it is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirement for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that:

Correctness: **False**
