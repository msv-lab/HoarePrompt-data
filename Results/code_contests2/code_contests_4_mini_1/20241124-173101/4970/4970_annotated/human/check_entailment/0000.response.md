To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the annotated code and the problem description.

### Problem Description Analysis
The problem states that the input is a single integer `a` such that \(0 \leq a \leq 15\), and the output should also be a single integer. The example given indicates that if the input is `3`, the output should be `13`.

### Annotated Program Examination
```python
def func():
    print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

The program defines a function `func()` that prints an element from a predefined list based on the integer input received from `raw_input()`. 

- The list is `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
- The input is converted to an integer and used as an index to access this list.

### Validating Inputs
Potential inputs based on the problem description are integers from `0` to `15`. The list has a length of `16`, meaning valid indices are `0` to `15`, which aligns with \(0 \leq a \leq 15\).

#### Index Mapping
- `0` returns `15`
- `1` returns `14`
- `2` returns `12`
- `3` returns `13`
- `4` returns `8`
- `5` returns `9`
- `6` returns `10`
- `7` returns `11`
- `8` returns `0`
- `9` returns `1`
- `10` returns `2`
- `11` returns `3`
- `12` returns `4`
- `13` returns `5`
- `14` returns `6`
- `15` returns `7`

### Example Check
For the specific case provided in the example:
- Input: `3` 
- Output: The program correctly returns `13`, which matches the expected output.

### Edge Cases
We need to ensure the program handles all edge cases within the defined range:
- If we input `0`, we get `15`.
- If we input `15`, we get `7`.
- All inputs from `0` to `15` yield valid outputs as defined by the list.

### Conclusion
Since the program correctly maps all inputs from `0` to `15` to their respective outputs without any exceptions or errors, and since it adheres strictly to the problem requirements, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
