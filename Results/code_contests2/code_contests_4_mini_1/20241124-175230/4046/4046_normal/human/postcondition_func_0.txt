The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and computes the smallest integer formed by equal counts of the digits '4' and '7', with a length that is even and at least the length of `n`. If no such integer is found that is greater than or equal to `n`, it defaults to returning 4444477777. If `l` (the length of `n`) is odd, the function does not generate any combinations and will also return 4444477777 in that case.
