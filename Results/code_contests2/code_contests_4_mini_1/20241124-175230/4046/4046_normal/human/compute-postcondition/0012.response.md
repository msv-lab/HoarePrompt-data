Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even integer between 2 and 8 or an odd integer between 1 and 9, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value (4444477777) and `tem` if the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If the counts are not equal, or if `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777. Additionally, `x` is generated from the product of '74' repeated `i` times, which ensures that both the counts of '4' and '7' are equal if `i` is even. Thus, when `i` is odd, the counts will not be equal, and `ans` will not be updated.***
