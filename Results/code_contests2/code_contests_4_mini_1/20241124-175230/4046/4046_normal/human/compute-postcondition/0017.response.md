Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either an even integer between 2 and 8 or an odd integer between 1 and 9, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value (4444477777) and `tem` if the count of '7's in `x` equals the count of '4's in `x` and `tem` (formed from elements of `x`) is greater than or equal to `n`. If `tem` is less than `n`, or if the counts of '7' and '4' are not equal, the value of `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777. Additionally, `i` is the next even integer.***
