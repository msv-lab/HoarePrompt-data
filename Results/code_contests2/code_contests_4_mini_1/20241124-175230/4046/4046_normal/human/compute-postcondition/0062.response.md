Postcondition: ***`ans` is a valid minimum integer formed with equal counts of '7's and '4's. If the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's, `tem` is the integer formed by joining `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. The variable `i` is equal to 4, and `l` is less than 10.***
