Postcondition: ***`ans` is an integer, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`, which is 77777777. If `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777. Additionally, `i` is 8, `l` is less than or equal to 8, `x` is a tuple of eight '7's, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, while `tem` is 77777777.***
