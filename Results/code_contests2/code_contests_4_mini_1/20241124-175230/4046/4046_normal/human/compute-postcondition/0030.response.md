The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The initial value of `ans` is 4444477777, and the value of `tem` is 77777777. Since 77777777 is less than 4444477777, `ans` will be updated to 77777777.

The other variables (`i`, `l`, `x`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is updated from 4444477777 to 77777777, `i` is 8, `l` is less than or equal to 8, `x` is ('7', '7', '7', '7', '7', '7', '7', '7'), the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is 77777777.

Output State: **`ans` is 77777777, `i` is 8, `l` is less than or equal to 8, `x` is ('7', '7', '7', '7', '7', '7', '7', '7'), the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is 77777777.**
