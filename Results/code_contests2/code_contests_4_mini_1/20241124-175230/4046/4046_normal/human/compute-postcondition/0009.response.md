Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even integer between 2 and 8 or an odd integer between 1 and 9, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l`, `x` is a string generated from the product of '74' repeated `i` times, and `tem` is an integer formed from `x`. The value of `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
