Postcondition: ***`ans` is 4444477777, `i` is 9, `l` is less than or equal to 9, `x` is a tuple of nine '7's, and `tem` is 777777777. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` (which is 777777777). If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777.***
