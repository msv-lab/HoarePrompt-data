The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The current values are `ans` is 4444477777 and `tem` is 777777777. The minimum of these two values is 777777777, which will be assigned to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is 777777777, `i` is 9, `l` is less than or equal to 9, `x` is a tuple of nine '7's, and `tem` is 777777777.
