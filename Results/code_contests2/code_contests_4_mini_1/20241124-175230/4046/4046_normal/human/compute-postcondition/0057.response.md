Postcondition: ***`ans` is a valid minimum integer that can be formed with equal counts of '7's and '4's, `i` is 4, and `l` is less than 10. If the count of '7's in `x` equals the count of '4's, and if `tem` is defined as the integer formed by `x`, then if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is undefined, it does not affect the value of `ans`. If the count of '7's is not equal to the count of '4's, `ans` remains unchanged.***
