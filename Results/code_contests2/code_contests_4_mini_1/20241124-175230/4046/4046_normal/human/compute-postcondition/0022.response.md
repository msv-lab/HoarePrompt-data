Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either an even integer between 2 and 8 or an odd integer between 1 and 9. If the count of '7's in `x` equals the count of '4's in `x`, and `tem` (formed from elements of `x`) is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value (4444477777) and `tem`. If the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` do not match, or if `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777. The value of `i` is the next even integer plus 2. The variable `tem` remains undefined if the condition is not met.***
