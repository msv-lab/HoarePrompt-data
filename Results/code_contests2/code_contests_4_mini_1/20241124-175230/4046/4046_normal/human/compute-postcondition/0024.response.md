Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value (4444477777) and `tem` if `x` has an equal count of '7's and '4's, and if `tem` (formed from `x`) is greater than or equal to `n`. If `i` is odd, the loop does not execute since equal counts of '7's and '4's are not possible, and `ans` remains 4444477777. If `i` is even and valid, the loop executes multiple times based on the combinations of '7' and '4', ensuring all generated numbers with equal counts are considered. If no valid `tem` is found that meets the conditions, `ans` will remain unchanged at 4444477777. Therefore, if `i` is odd, the loop does not execute and `ans` is 4444477777; if `i` is even and there are no valid combinations meeting the conditions, `ans` will also remain 4444477777.**
