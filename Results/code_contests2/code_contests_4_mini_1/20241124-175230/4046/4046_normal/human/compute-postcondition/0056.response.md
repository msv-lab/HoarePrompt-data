Postcondition: ***`ans` is a valid minimum integer that can be formed with equal counts of '7's and '4's, `i` is 4, and `l` is less than 10. If `tem` is defined and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is undefined, it does not affect the value of `ans`.***
