Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, where `tem` is derived from the integer value of `x` (which contains equal counts of '7's and '4's). If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` may be updated to the minimum value; otherwise, `ans` remains 4444477777. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 regardless of the condition.***
