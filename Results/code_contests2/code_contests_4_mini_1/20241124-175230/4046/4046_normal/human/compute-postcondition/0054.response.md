The code assigns the value of `tem` as an integer formed by joining the elements of `x` together. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. The values of `ans`, `i`, and `l` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is that we have a valid minimum integer for `ans`, `i` is 4, and `l` is less than 10, while `tem` cannot be defined without knowing `x`.

Output State: **`ans` is a valid minimum integer that can be formed with equal counts of '7's and '4's, `i` is 4, and `l` is less than 10, but `tem` is undefined without `x`**
