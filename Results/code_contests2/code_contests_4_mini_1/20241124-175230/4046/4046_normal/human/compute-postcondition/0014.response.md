The variable `tem` is assigned the value obtained by converting a string (formed by joining the elements of `x`) into an integer using `int()`. However, the specifics of `x` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine a concrete value for `tem`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even integer between 2 and 8 or an odd integer between 1 and 9, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is the next even integer, and `tem` is an integer formed from elements of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even integer between 2 and 8 or an odd integer between 1 and 9, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is the next even integer, and `tem` is an integer formed from elements of `x`**.
