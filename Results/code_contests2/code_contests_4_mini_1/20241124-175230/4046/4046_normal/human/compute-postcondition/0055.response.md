The code assigns the value of `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `tem`. However, since `tem` is undefined without `x`, it cannot be evaluated, which means `min(ans, tem)` will result in an error or undefined behavior. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as the calculation cannot be completed. Thus, the output state reflects that `tem` remains undefined.

Output State: **`ans` is a valid minimum integer that can be formed with equal counts of '7's and '4's, `i` is 4, `l` is less than 10, and `tem` is undefined**
