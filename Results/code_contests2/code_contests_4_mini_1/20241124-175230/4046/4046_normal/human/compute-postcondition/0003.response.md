The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` is originally an odd integer between 1 and 10, the new value of `l` will be an even integer between 2 and 11. The values of `n` and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `l` is now an even integer between 2 and 11; `ans` is 4444477777.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is now an even integer between 2 and 11; `ans` is 4444477777**
