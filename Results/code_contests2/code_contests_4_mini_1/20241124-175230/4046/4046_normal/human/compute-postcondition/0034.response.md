The variable `x` is a tuple containing nine '7's. The code snippet takes this tuple, converts each element to a string, joins them together to form a single string '777777777', and then converts that string to an integer. Thus, `tem` is assigned the value `777777777`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ans` is 4444477777, `i` is 9, `l` is less than or equal to 9, `x` is a tuple of nine '7's, and `tem` is 777777777**
