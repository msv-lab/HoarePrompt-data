Postcondition: ***`ans` is a valid minimum integer formed with equal counts of '7's and '4's. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. The variables `i` is equal to 4, `l` is less than 10, and `tem` is the integer formed by joining `x`. If `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
