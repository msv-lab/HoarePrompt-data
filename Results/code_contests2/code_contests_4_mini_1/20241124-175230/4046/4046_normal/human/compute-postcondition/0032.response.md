Postcondition: ***`ans` is an integer initialized to 4444477777, `i` is 8, `l` is less than or equal to 8, and `x` is a tuple of eight '7's. If the count of '7's in `x` equals the count of '4's in `x`, then `tem`, which is the integer 77777777, is compared with `n`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, or if the counts are not equal, the value of `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777.***
