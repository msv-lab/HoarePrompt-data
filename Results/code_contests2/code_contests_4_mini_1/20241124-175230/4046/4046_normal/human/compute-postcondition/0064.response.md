Output State: **`ans` is the minimum integer that can be formed with equal counts of '7's and '4's of length `i`, if such a number exists and is greater than or equal to `n`. If there are no valid combinations, `ans` remains 4444477777. The variable `i` is at least 2 and even, and `l` is less than 10. If `n` is greater than the maximum possible integer formed with equal counts of '7's and '4's of length `i`, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains unchanged. If `i` is odd, the loop does not execute as equal counts of '7's and '4's are not possible, and `ans` remains 4444477777. If `i` is less than 2, the loop will not execute, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
