Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either an even integer between 2 and 8 or an odd integer between 1 and 9, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value (4444477777) and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777. The value of `i` is the next even integer plus 2, and `tem` remains undefined if not assigned. Additionally, the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are relevant for determining if `ans` should be updated, but this condition is not directly reflected in the provided code.***
