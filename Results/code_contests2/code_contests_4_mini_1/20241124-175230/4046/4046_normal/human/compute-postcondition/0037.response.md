Postcondition: ***`ans` is 4444477777. If the count of '7's in `x` equals the count of '4's in `x`, then `tem` is computed as 777777777. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777. If the counts are not equal, `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777.***
