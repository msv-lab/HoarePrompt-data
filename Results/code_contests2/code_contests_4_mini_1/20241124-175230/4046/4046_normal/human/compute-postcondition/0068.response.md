The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). The function's behavior or output based on the value of `n` is not specified. Therefore, we cannot determine specific return values or cases based on the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` within the range of 1 to 10^9, but the specific output or return value based on `n` is not defined.**
