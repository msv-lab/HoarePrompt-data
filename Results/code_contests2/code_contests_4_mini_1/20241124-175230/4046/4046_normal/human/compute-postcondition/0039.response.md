The code assigns a new value to the variable `tem`. The value of `x` is not provided, so it is unknown what the joined string will be. Since `ans` and `i` are not affected by this line, the output state remains unchanged for those variables. Therefore, we cannot determine the value of `tem` because it depends on the content of `x`.

Output State: **`ans` is 4444477777, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, and `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))` where `x` is unknown**
