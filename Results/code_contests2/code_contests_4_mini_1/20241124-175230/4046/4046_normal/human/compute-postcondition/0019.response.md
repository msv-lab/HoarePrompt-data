To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is assumed to be a collection (like a list) of elements that can be joined into a string and converted into an integer.
2. The value of `tem` will depend on the contents of `x`, which is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`.
3. The other variables such as `n`, `l`, `ans`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code.

Since we do not have information about the contents of `x`, we cannot ascertain the exact value of `tem`. However, `tem` is being formed from `x`, and the output state will reflect that `tem` has been created but remains undefined without the value of `x`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either an even integer between 2 and 8 or an odd integer between 1 and 9, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value (4444477777) and `tem` if the count of '7's in `x` equals the count of '4's in `x` and `tem` (formed from elements of `x`) is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is the next even integer plus 2, `tem` is created from `x` but is undefined.**
