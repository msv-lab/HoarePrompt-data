Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 4444477777 or the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, provided that `tem` (which is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is unknown) is greater than or equal to `n`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 regardless of the outcome. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777.***
