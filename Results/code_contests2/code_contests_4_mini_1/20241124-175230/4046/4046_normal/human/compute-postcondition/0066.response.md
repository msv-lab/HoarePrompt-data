Output State: **If `l` is odd, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains 4444477777. If `l` is even, the loop executes for even values of `i` from `l` to 10, generating combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`. After each execution, `ans` is updated to the minimum integer that can be formed with equal counts of '7's and '4's of length `i`, if such a number exists and is greater than or equal to `n`. If no valid combinations are found for any of the iterations, `ans` remains 4444477777. If `n` is less than the smallest possible valid `tem`, `ans` will also remain 4444477777. If `i` exceeds the maximum length of combinations that satisfy the equal count condition, the loop will not execute further and `ans` will remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` is the minimum integer formed from valid combinations, or 4444477777 if no valid combinations meet the conditions.**
