The variable `tem` is assigned the value `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is a tuple containing eight '7' characters. The `join` method concatenates these characters into the string '77777777', which is then converted to an integer. The value of `tem` will be 77777777. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`ans` is 4444477777, `i` is 8, `l` is less than or equal to 8, `x` is ('7', '7', '7', '7', '7', '7', '7', '7'), and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`; `tem` is 77777777**
