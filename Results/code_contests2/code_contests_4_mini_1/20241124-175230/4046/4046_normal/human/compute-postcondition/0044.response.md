Output State: **`ans` is the minimum integer that can be formed with equal counts of '7's and '4's of length `i` that is greater than or equal to `n`, if such a number exists; otherwise, `ans` remains 4444477777. If `i` is less than or equal to 0, or if `l` is less than 0, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains 4444477777. The loop will also not execute if `i` is greater than the maximum length of combinations of '7's and '4's that meet the equal count condition, resulting in `ans` being 4444477777.**
