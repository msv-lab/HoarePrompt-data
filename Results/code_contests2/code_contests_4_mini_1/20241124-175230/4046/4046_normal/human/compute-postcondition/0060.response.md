The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of the current value of `ans` and the value of `tem`. Since `ans` is a valid minimum integer formed with equal counts of '7's and '4's and `tem` is the integer formed by joining `x`, the output state reflects the new value of `ans` after the comparison. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `tem`, `i` is 4, `l` is less than 10, `tem` is the integer formed by joining `x`**
