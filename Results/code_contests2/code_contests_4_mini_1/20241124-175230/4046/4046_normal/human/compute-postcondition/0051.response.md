Postcondition: ***`ans` is a valid minimum integer that can be formed with equal counts of '7's and '4's, `i` is at least 2 and even, `l` is less than 10, and the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`. If `tem`, which is an integer formed from the joined string of `x`, is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
