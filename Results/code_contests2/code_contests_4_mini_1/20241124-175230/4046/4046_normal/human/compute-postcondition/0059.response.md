The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, but it is implied that `x` should be a list of characters (either '4's or '7's) since `ans` is a valid minimum integer formed with equal counts of '7's and '4's. Therefore, `x` would likely contain a combination of '4's and '7's, resulting in a valid integer when joined and converted to an integer.

Since `ans` is a valid minimum integer with equal counts of '4's and '7's, we can assume that `x` must have been constructed to represent this integer. However, without the exact composition of `x`, we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`.

The other variables `i` and `l` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unknown value of `tem` while stating the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`ans` is a valid minimum integer that can be formed with equal counts of '7's and '4's; `i` is 4; `l` is less than 10; `tem` is the integer formed by joining `x`.**
