The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The variable `tem` is an integer formed from joining the elements of `x`, but its specific value is not given. The initial value of `ans` is a minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's, which we denote as its current state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is updated based on the comparison with `tem`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, and `tem` is an integer formed from joining the elements of `x`**
