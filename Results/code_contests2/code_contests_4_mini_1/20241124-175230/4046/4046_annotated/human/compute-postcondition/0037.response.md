Postcondition: ***`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's from `x`. If the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are equal, then `tem` is set as the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If the counts are equal but `tem` is less than `n`, or if the counts of '7's and '4's are not equal, `ans` remains unchanged. Additionally, since `l` is an even integer less than 10 and `i` is equal to `l + 1`, these constraints are maintained throughout the execution.***
