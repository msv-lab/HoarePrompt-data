The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the value of `tem`. Since `ans` is defined as the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's from `x`, and `tem` is an integer value formed from `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`, the new value of `ans` will be the smaller of the two: the current `ans` or `tem`. The states of the other variables (`l`, `i`, `tem`, and `n`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is updated based on the comparison with `tem`, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is equal to `l`, `tem` is the integer value formed from `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the comparison with `tem`, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is equal to `l`, `tem` is the integer value formed from `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n**
