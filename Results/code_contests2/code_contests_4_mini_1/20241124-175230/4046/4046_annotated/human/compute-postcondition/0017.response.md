Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is 8, `ans` is either 4444477777 or 77777777, `i` is 9, and `x` is '77777777'. If the count of '7's equals the count of '4's in `x`, then `tem` is calculated as 77777777. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, which could potentially change `ans` to 77777777. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777. If the count of '7's is not equal to the count of '4's, `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777.***
