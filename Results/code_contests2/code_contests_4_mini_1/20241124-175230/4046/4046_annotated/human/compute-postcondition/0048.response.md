The variable `tem` is assigned the integer value formed by joining the characters in the string `x`. Given that `x` consists of equal counts of '4's and '7's, the integer value `tem` will be a valid integer formed by these characters. The initial state of `ans`, `l`, and `i` is not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's from `x`, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is equal to `l + 2`, and `tem` is the integer formed from `x`.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's from `x`, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is equal to `l + 2`, and `tem` is the integer formed from `x`.**
