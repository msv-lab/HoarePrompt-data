According to the code, the loop iterates over combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9, meaning that the loop has processed all combinations of '7's and '4's of length 9. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 10, allowing the loop to generate combinations of '7's and '4's of length 10. The other states (`n`, `l`, `ans`, `x`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not directly affected by the loop iteration control.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is 8, `ans` is either 4444477777 or 77777777, `i` is 10, and `x` is '77777777'.**
