`tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The variable `x` is '77777777', so when we join `x`, it remains '77777777', and converting it to an integer gives `tem` the value 77777777. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is 8, `ans` is either 4444477777 or 77777777, `i` is 10, and `x` is '77777777'; `tem` is 77777777.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is 8, `ans` is either 4444477777 or 77777777, `i` is 10, `x` is '77777777', `tem` is 77777777**
