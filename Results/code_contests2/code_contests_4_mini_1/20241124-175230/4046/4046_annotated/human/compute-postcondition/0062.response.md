Postcondition: ***`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's. If the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are equal, then the integer `tem` is computed from `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current state and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. In either case, `i` is incremented by 1.***
