The value of `ans` is assigned the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The initial state indicates that `ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's, and `tem` represents the integer formed from a combination of '4's and '7's based on the value of `x`. Without knowing the specific values of `ans` and `tem`, we can conclude that `ans` will be updated to the smaller of the two values. Therefore, the output state reflects the comparison of those two values.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l + 2`, `tem` is the integer value of the combination of '4's and '7's from `x`**
