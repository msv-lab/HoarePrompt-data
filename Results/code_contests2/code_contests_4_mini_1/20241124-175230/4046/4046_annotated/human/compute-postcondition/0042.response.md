Postcondition: ***`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's from `x`. If the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's, `tem` is the integer formed by `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. If the counts of '7's and '4's are not equal, `ans` remains unchanged. Additionally, since `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` will be at least 2 and can be 4, 6, or 8.***
