Postcondition: ***`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's from `x`, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is equal to `l`, and `tem` is the integer value formed from `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged.***
