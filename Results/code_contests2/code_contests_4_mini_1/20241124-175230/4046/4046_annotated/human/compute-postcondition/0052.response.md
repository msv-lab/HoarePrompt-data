Postcondition: ***`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's from `x`, which is initially set to 4444477777 if no valid combinations exist. If `x` contains equal counts of '7's and '4's, then `tem` is the integer formed from `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. If the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are not equal, or if `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. Additionally, `l` is an even integer less than 10, and `i` is equal to `l + 2`, ensuring that `x` is initially composed of '4' repeated `i` times.***
