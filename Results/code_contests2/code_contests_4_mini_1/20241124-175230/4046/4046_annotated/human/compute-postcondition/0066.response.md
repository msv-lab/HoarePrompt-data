Output State: **`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, or remains 4444477777 if no valid combinations exist. If `l` is odd, `l` is incremented by 1 to ensure it is even. If `l` is less than 2 or if `l` is not an even integer less than 10, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 4444477777. Additionally, if there are no valid integers with equal counts of '7's and '4's that meet the criteria, `ans` will also remain unchanged at its initial value.**
