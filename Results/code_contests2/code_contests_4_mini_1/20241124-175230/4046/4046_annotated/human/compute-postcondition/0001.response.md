The variable `l` is assigned the value `len(str(n))`, which calculates the length of the string representation of the positive integer `n`. The variable `ans` is assigned the constant value `4444477777`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer based on user input, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, and `ans` is 4444477777.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, and `ans` is 4444477777**
