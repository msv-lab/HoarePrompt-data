Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is 8, `ans` is either 4444477777 or 77777777, `i` is 10, and `x` is '77777777'. If the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4', then `tem` is set to 77777777. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. In the case where the counts do not match, the value of `ans` stays the same as the initial state.***
