Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is 8, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is 8, `x` is '77777777', and if the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, then `tem` is calculated as 77777777. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, potentially changing `ans` to 77777777. If `tem` is less than `n`, then `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777. If the count of '7's is not equal to the count of '4's, there are no changes to `ans` and it remains 4444477777.***
