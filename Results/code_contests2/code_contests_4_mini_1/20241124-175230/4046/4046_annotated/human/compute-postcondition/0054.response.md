The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which means that the string formed by joining the elements of `x` is converted into an integer. The value of `x` determines the string that is being converted. Since `x` is the next combination of '4's and '7's of length `i`, `tem` will hold an integer representation of that combination. Other variables `ans` and `i` remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's, `i` is equal to `l + 2`, and `tem` is the integer value of the combination of '4's and '7's from `x`.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's, `i` is equal to `l + 2`, and `tem` is the integer value of the combination of '4's and '7's from `x`**.
