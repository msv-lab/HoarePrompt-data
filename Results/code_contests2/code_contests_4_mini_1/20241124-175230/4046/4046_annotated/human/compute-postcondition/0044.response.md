Output State: **`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's from `x`, or remains 4444477777 if no valid combinations exist. `l` is an even integer less than 10, and `i` is equal to `l`. The loop will execute for all combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`. If `i` is 0 or if `l` is not an even integer less than 10, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 4444477777. If there are no valid integers with equal counts of '7's and '4's greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` also remains 4444477777.**
