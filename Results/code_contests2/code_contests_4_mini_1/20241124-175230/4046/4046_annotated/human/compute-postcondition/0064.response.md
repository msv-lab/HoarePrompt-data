Output State: **`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's, which is initially set to 4444477777 if no valid combinations exist. If `x` contains equal counts of '7's and '4's and the integer `tem` formed from `x` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. If the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are not equal or if `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. The loop will not execute if `i` is less than or equal to 0, resulting in `ans` remaining 4444477777. If `i` is set such that all combinations of '4's and '7's generated are invalid (i.e., no equal counts), then `ans` will also remain unchanged at its initial value.**
