Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is 8, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is 8, `x` is '77777777', and `tem` is 77777777. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, which could potentially change `ans` to 77777777 if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `tem` is less than `n`, then `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777.***
