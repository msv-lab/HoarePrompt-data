The variable `tem` is assigned the value created by joining the elements of the iterable `x` into a string, which is then converted to an integer using `int()`. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the resulting value of `tem`. The other variables are not affected, but we note that `i` has been incremented previously. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, and `tem` is an integer formed from joining the elements of `x`.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, and `tem` is an integer formed from joining the elements of `x`**
