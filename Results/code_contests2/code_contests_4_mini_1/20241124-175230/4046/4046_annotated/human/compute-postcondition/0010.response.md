The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value (4444477777) and `tem` (77777777). Since `tem` is less than `ans`, `ans` is updated to 77777777. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is 8, `ans` is 77777777, `i` is 8, `x` is '77777777', `tem` is 77777777, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is 8, `ans` is 77777777, `i` is 8, `x` is '77777777', `tem` is 77777777, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n**
