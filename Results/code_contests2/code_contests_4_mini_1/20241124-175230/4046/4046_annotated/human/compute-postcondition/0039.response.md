The initial state indicates that `x` is a collection of characters forming the minimum valid integer composed of equal counts of '7's and '4's. The variable `tem` is assigned the integer value formed by concatenating the characters in `x`. Since `x` is a string of characters, the conversion into an integer will depend on its contents.

Given that `i` is equal to `l + 2` and `l` is an even integer less than 10, the possible values for `l` can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Thus, `i` could be 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 respectively. However, since `i` does not affect the conversion of `x` to `tem`, it will not be considered in the output state.

The value of `tem` will depend on what `x` contains. As the exact contents of `x` are not specified, we can only state that `tem` will be an integer formed by the characters in `x`. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `tem` is the integer formed from `x`, while `ans` remains unchanged as the minimum valid integer based on the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's from `x`; `tem` is the integer formed by `x`**.
