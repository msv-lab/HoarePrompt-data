Postcondition: ***`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's. If `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's and the integer value `tem`, formed by the combination of '4's and '7's from `x`, is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
