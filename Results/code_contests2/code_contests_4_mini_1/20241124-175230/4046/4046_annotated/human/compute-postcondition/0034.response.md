The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which means that it concatenates the elements of `x` into a string and then converts that string to an integer. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `x`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. Other variables `ans`, `l`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is that `ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's from `x`, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is equal to `l + 1`, and `tem` is an integer formed by concatenating elements of `x`.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's from `x`, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is equal to `l + 1`, and `tem` is an integer formed by concatenating elements of `x`.**
