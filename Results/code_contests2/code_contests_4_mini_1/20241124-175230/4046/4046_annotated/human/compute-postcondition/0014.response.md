The value of `tem` is assigned the integer value of the string obtained by joining the elements of `x`, which is '77777777'. Therefore, `tem` becomes 77777777. Next, we check the count of '7's and '4's in `x`. The count of '7's in `x` is 8, and the count of '4's is 0. Since these counts are not equal, there are no changes to `ans`, which remains 4444477777. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is 8, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is 9, `x` is '77777777', `tem` is 77777777, and `ans` remains 4444477777.**
