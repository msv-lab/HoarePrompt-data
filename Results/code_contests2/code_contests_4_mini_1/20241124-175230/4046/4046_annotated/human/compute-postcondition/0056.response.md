Postcondition: ***`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's, `i` is equal to `l + 2`, and if the integer value `tem` formed by the combination of '4's and '7's from `x` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
