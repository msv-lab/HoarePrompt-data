The code assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `tem` to `ans`. `ans` represents the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's from `x`, and `tem` is the integer formed by `x`. Therefore, after execution:

- If `tem` is less than `ans`, `ans` will take the value of `tem`.
- If `ans` is less than or equal to `tem`, `ans` remains unchanged.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `ans` based on the comparison. Since the specific values of `ans` and `tem` are not provided, we can only describe their relationship.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's from `x`; `tem` is the integer formed by `x`; `ans` is updated to be the minimum of the two values**
