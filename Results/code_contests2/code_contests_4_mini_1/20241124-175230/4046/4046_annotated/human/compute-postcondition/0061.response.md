Postcondition: ***`ans` is the minimum valid integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `i` is still incremented by 1.***
