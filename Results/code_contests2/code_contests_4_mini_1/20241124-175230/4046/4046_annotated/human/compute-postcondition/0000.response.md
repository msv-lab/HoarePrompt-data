The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is initially a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the output state reflects that `n` has been updated to the new input value. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is that `n` is now a positive integer based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input**
