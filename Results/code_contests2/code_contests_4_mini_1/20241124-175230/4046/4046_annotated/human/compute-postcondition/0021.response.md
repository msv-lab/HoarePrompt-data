Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is 8, `ans` is either 4444477777 or 77777777, `i` is 10, `x` is '77777777', and `tem` is 77777777. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
