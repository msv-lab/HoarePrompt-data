The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The value of `x` is '77777777', so `''.join(x)` results in '77777777'. The `int` function converts this string to an integer, which is 77777777. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is 8, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is 8, `x` is '77777777', and `tem` is 77777777.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is 8, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is 8, `x` is '77777777', `tem` is 77777777**
