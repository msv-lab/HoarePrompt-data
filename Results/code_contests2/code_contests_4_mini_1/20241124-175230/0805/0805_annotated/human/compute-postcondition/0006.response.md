The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The values of `index` and `n` are previously defined, where `index` is the position of `s` in `letters` and `n` is an input integer between 0 and 26. Therefore, `added_index` will be the sum of `index` and `n`, which can range based on the values of these variables.

Since the exact values of `index` and `n` are not provided, we cannot determine a specific value for `added_index`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, and `added_index` is `index + n`.**
