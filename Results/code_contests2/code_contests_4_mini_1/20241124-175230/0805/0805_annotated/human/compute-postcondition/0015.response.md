The variable `new_strings` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with `new_s`. The previous value of `new_strings` is not specified, but it will now hold its previous value plus the new character `new_s`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a string with at least 1 more character than before; `s` is the character at the next position in `strings`; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26`; `new_s` is the character at `new_index` in `letters`; `new_strings` is now equal to its previous value concatenated with `new_s`.
