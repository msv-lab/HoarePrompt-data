The `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is determined by `index + n`, where `index` is the position of `s` in `letters` and `n` is an input integer. Since `n` is guaranteed to be between 0 and 26, the result of `added_index % 26` will give a value that wraps around within the range of 0 to 25. 

The other variables (`S`, `N`, `strings`, `s`, `index`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `new_index` has been calculated based on the given conditions.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a string with at least 1 more character than before; `s` is the character at the next position in `strings`; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
