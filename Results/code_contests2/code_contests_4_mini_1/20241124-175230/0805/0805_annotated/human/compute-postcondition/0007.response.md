The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is previously defined as `index + n`. Given that `N` is an integer such that `0 <= N <= 26`, the value of `added_index` will also be within the range of `0` to `52`. Therefore, when calculating `new_index`, the result will be in the range of `0` to `25` due to the modulo operation with `26`. 

The other variables are not affected by this assignment, so the output state remains unchanged for them.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, and `new_index` is `added_index % 26`**.
