The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The value of `index` is determined by the position of the character `s` in the string `letters`, and `n` is an integer with a range of 0 to 26. Therefore, the value of `added_index` will depend on the specific values of `index` and `n`. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a string with at least 1 more character than before; `s` is the character at the next position in `strings`; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`.**
