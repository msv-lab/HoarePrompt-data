The variable `new_strings` is assigned an empty string. This does not affect the other variables: `S`, `N`, `n`, `strings`, or `letters`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for those variables, while `new_strings` is now an empty string.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is an input string from the user, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `new_strings` is an empty string**.
