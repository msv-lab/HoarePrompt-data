The function `func` accepts two parameters: `S` and `N`. `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, and `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26. The length of `S` is between 1 and 10^4. The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string `S` of uppercase English letters and an integer `N` within the specified range. However, without additional information about the output based on the inputs, we cannot specify the exact return values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S consisting of uppercase English letters and an integer N such that 0 <= N <= 26.**
