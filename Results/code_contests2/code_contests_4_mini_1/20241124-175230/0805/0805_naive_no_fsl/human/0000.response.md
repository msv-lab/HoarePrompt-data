Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It takes an integer `N` and a string `S`, then shifts each character in `S` by `N` positions in the alphabetical order, wrapping around when necessary (i.e., when the shift goes past 'Z', it continues from 'A').

The program handles the following:

1. It reads the integer `N` and string `S` correctly.
2. It constructs a string `letters` representing the uppercase English letters.
3. For each character in the input string `S`, it finds its index in the `letters` string.
4. It calculates the new index by adding `N` to the original index and using modulo 26 to wrap around if necessary.
5. It constructs the new string by appending the shifted characters and finally prints the result.

The code has been tested against the provided examples and appears to handle edge cases, such as shifting characters that wrap from 'Z' back to 'A'.

Since there are no identified edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements, it is deemed correct. Thus, the output is:

Correctness: **True**
