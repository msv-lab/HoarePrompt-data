The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state of the variable `N` is not affected, and `S` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, and `n` is an input integer**
