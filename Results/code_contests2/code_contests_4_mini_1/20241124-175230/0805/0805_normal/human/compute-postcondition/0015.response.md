The code snippet `new_strings += new_s` appends the value of `new_s` to `new_strings`. The initial state mentions that `new_s` is derived from the previous computations involving `s`, `index`, `added_index`, and `new_index`. The specific value of `new_s` is determined by the logic that computes it based on the character in `letters` at the position `new_index`.

Since `new_strings` is updated by appending `new_s`, the previous state of `new_strings` is not known from the given initial conditions, but it is assumed to have some existing value as indicated by the operation.

The output state therefore reflects the updated `new_strings`, which now includes the new character `new_s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters; `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'; `s` is the second character of `strings`; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is computed based on previous values; `new_index` is computed as added_index % 26; `new_s` is the character from `letters` at position `new_index`; `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`.**
