The variable `new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`. The variable `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is `index + n`. The values of `s`, `index`, and `letters` are used to determine `new_index`. The output state reflects the values of the variables involved.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is added_index % 26, and `new_s` is letters[new_index].**
