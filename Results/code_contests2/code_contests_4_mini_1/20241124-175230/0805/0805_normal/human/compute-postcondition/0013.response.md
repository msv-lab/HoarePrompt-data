To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables, considering their initial values.

1. `added_index` is already computed based on the values of `index` and `n`.
2. The code calculates `new_index` as `added_index % 26`.

Since `added_index` is a numeric value derived from the previous calculations, `new_index` will be the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26.

Assuming `added_index` is valid and within the range of integers, the computation will yield a value for `new_index`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Thus, the output state reflects the fact that `new_index` has been computed, while the values of other variables are unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `s` is the second character of `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is computed based on previous values, and `new_index` is computed as added_index % 26.**
