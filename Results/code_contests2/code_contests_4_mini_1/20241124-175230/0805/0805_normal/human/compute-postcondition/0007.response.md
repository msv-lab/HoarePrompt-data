The statement assigns a new value to `new_index`, which is calculated using `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is dependent on the previous values of `index` and `n`. The values of `S`, `N`, `n`, `strings`, `letters`, `new_strings`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and provides information about the newly calculated `new_index`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is added_index % 26.**
