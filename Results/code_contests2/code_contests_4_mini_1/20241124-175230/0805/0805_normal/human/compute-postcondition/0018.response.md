The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The previous value of `index` is determined by the position of `s` in `letters`, and `n` is an input integer within the range of 0 to 26. Therefore, the value of `added_index` can vary based on the values of `index` and `n`. The other variables remain unaffected. The output state is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters; `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'; `s` is the third character of `strings`; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`.
