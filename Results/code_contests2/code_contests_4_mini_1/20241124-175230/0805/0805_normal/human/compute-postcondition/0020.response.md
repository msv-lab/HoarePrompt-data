To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the variables step by step based on the initial state.

1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `S`: A string consisting of uppercase English letters (value not specified).
   - `N`: An integer such that 0 <= N <= 26 (value not specified).
   - `n`: An input integer (value not specified).
   - `strings`: A non-empty string with at least 3 characters (value not specified).
   - `letters`: The string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
   - `s`: The third character of `strings`.
   - `index`: The position of `s` in `letters`.
   - `added_index`: Calculated as `index + n`.
   - `new_index`: Calculated as `added_index % 26`.

2. **Executing the Code**:
   - The code snippet assigns `new_s` the value of `letters[new_index]`.
   - The value of `new_index` is derived from the previous calculations involving `index` and `n`, but we must note that `index` is determined by the position of the character `s` in the string `letters`.

Since all the values depend on external inputs that are not provided (like `strings` and `n`), we cannot specify exact values of `s`, `index`, `added_index`, or `new_index`. However, once `new_index` is calculated, `new_s` will be assigned the character from `letters` at that position.

3. **Output State**:
Given that `new_s` is assigned based on the calculation of `new_index`, the output state can be stated as:
- `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters.
- `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `strings` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters.
- `s` is the third character of `strings`.
- `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`.
- `added_index` is `index + n`.
- `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.
- `new_s` is assigned the value from `letters` at `new_index`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters; `s` is the third character of `strings`; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26`; `new_s` is assigned letters[new_index].**
