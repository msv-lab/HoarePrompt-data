The function accepts an integer `n` (input by the user) and a string of uppercase English letters (also input by the user). It shifts each letter in the string by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if the end of the alphabet is exceeded. The function outputs the resulting shifted string. However, if the input string is empty, the output will be an empty string. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input characters are not uppercase English letters, which could lead to an error when attempting to find their index in the `letters` string.
