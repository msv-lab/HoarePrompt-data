Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes an integer `N` and a string `S`, then shifts each character of `S` by `N` positions in the alphabetical order, wrapping around when necessary (e.g., `A` follows `Z`). 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. It reads the integer `N` and the string `S`.
2. It defines a string `letters` containing all uppercase English letters.
3. For each character in the input string `S`, it finds its index in `letters`.
4. It calculates the new index after shifting by `N`, ensuring it wraps around using modulo 26.
5. It constructs the new string with the shifted characters.
6. Finally, it prints the resulting string.

The program handles all edge cases as described:
- For `N = 0`, it returns the same string `S`.
- For `N` in the range [1, 26], it correctly shifts characters and wraps around when needed.

All the provided examples in the problem description work correctly with this implementation. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
