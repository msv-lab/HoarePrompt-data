Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values. If `a[i - 1]` is True (which it is, since `i` is 2), all indices of `a` that are multiples of `i` starting from `i^2 - 1` are set to False; specifically, all odd indices starting from 3 are set to False, while even indices remain True. If `i` were greater than 999, the loop would not execute, and `a` would remain all True values.***
