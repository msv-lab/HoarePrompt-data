The value of `a[j]` is set to `False`. Given that `j` is 14, this means that `a[14]` will be assigned the value `False`. The initial state of the array `a` had all values as `True` except for `a[8]` and `a[11]`, which were `False`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values except `a[8]` is False, `a[11]` is False, and `a[14]` is now False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values except `a[8]` is False, `a[11]` is False, and `a[14]` is now False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14**
