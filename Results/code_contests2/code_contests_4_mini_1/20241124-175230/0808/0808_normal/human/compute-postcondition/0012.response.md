According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which is less than 1,000,000. Therefore, the loop can execute again. 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the beginning of each iteration of the loop, for the next iteration, `i` should be adjusted to 3. The value of `n` and the state of the list `a` do not need to be adjusted, as they remain valid for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values; `i` is 3**
