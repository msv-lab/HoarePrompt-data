Functionality: ** The function generates a list of boolean values indicating the primality of numbers from 1 to 999,999, where `True` represents a prime number. For each integer input received from standard input, it counts and prints the number of prime numbers from 1 up to that integer value. If the input is less than 2, the count will be 0 as there are no prime numbers less than 2. The function does not return any value but prints the counts directly to the output. **
