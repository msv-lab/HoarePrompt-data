To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the for loop statement and the initial state provided.

1. **Understanding the loop**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`. The start of the loop is at `i ** 2 - 1`, the stop condition is `1000000`, and the step is `i`.
   
2. **Calculating the starting value**: Given `i` is 4,
   - Calculate `i ** 2 - 1`: 
     - \( 4^2 - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15 \)
   - Therefore, the loop will start at `j = 15`.

3. **Determining the range**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `1000000`. Since the starting value is `15`, it satisfies the condition to start the loop. 

4. **Checking the initial values**: The initial state has `n` as an integer within the range and `a` as a list of True values, but these do not affect the execution of the loop directly. The only relevant variables for this for loop are `i` and `j`.

5. **Final adjustments**: Before the loop starts, `j` must be initialized to `15`, which is computed from `i`. However, `j` will be automatically initialized to `15` by the range function, so there’s no need to explicitly set `j` in the state.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values; `i` is 4; `j` is 15**
