According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. The end of the last iteration indicates that `i` is 2, and `j` is 5.

The loop condition is defined by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`, which translates to `range(3, 1000000, 2)`. The next value of `j` would be `j + i`, which is `5 + 2 = 7`. Since `7` is still less than `1,000,000`, the loop can execute again.

Thus, for the loop to run one more time, the value of `j` needs to be updated to `7`. No other states need to be adjusted as `n` and `a[3]` do not affect the loop execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[3]` is False; `i` is 2; `j` is 7**
