To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop condition and the initial state provided.

1. The loop iterates through the range defined by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`. 
2. The starting point of the range is `i ** 2 - 1`. Given `i` is 2, we calculate:
   - `i ** 2 - 1 = 2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`.
3. The loop will start from 3 and continue until it reaches 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` (which is 2).
4. Therefore, the first value of `j` will be 3, and the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.

The conditions for the loop to execute are:
- The calculated starting point (3) must be less than 1,000,000, which it is.
- The variable `j` will take the values 3, 5, 7, ..., up to just below 1,000,000.

The state `a[1]` being True does not affect the execution of the loop directly since the loop does not use `a` in its condition; thus, it does not need to be adjusted for the loop's execution.

Given this analysis, the necessary states to be explicitly defined are:
- `j` starts at 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
