The code assigns `False` to `a[j]`, where `j` is 7. The array `a` had `a[3]` as `False`, but the value of `a[7]` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `a[7]` is now `False`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[3]` is False; `i` is 2; `j` is 7; `a[7]` is False**
