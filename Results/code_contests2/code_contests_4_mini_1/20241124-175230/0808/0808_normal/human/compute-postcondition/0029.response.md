According to the code, the loop can execute again if the starting value of `j` is less than 1000000. The starting value of `j` is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`. Given that `i` is 4, we have:

- `i ** 2` = 4 ** 2 = 16
- Therefore, `j` = 16 - 1 = 15

The loop iterates with `j` starting from 15 and increments by `i` (which is 4) until it reaches 1000000. 

The loop will execute if the current value of `j` (which is 23 at the end of the last iteration) is less than 1000000. Since `j` has already reached 23, it will increment by 4 in the next iteration, leading to:

- New value of `j` = 23 + 4 = 27

Since the loop continues until `j` reaches 1000000, and at the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently 23, it can execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[15]` is False; `a[19]` is False; `a[23]` is False; `i` is 4; `j` is 27**
