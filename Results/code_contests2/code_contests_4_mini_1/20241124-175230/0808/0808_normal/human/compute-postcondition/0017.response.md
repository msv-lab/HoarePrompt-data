According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `j` and the calculation of the range. The loop will execute while `j` is less than 1,000,000, starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and incrementing by `i` each time.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, which means `i ** 2 - 1` is \(3^2 - 1 = 8\). Therefore, the loop starts from 8 and increments by 3.

Given that `j` is currently 11, the next value of `j` will be \(j + i = 11 + 3 = 14\). Since 14 is less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute one more time.

No other states need to be adjusted as `n` and the list `a` do not affect the loop execution directly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values except `a[8]`, which is False; `a[11]` is now False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14**
