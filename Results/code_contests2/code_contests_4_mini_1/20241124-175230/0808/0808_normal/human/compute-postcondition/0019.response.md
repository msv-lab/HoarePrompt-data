According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop's range is calculated as `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`, where `i` is 3. 

1. **Calculate the starting point for the loop**: 
   - Since `i` is 3, `i ** 2 - 1` equals `3 ** 2 - 1`, which is `9 - 1 = 8`.
   - Therefore, the loop starts at 8 and increments by `i` (which is 3) until it reaches 1,000,000.

2. **Determine the current state of `j`**: 
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 14. 

3. **Check the range for the next iteration**:
   - The next value of `j` will be `14 + 3 = 17`, which is still less than 1,000,000. Hence, the loop can indeed execute one more time.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` will increment by `i` (3), we need to update `j` to 17.
   - The other states (`n` and `a`) do not need to be adjusted because they do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values except `a[8]` is False, `a[11]` is False, and `a[14]` is now False; `i` is 3; `j` is 17**
