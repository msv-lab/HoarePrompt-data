The value at index `j` of the list `a` is set to `False`. Given that `j` is 3, the value of `a[3]` changes from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and the rest of the elements in the list `a`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a[3]` is False; `i` is 2; `j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a[3]` is False; `i` is 2; `j` is 3**
