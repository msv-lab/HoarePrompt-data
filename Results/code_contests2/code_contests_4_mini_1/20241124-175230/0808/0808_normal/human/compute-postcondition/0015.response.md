According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `j`, which starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` on each iteration until it reaches 1,000,000. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `i` is 3
- Therefore, `i ** 2 - 1` is `3 ** 2 - 1` = `9 - 1` = `8`. 
- The loop initializes `j` at `8` and increments by `3` on each iteration.

We need to determine if the loop can execute again. The last value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration must be less than 1,000,000 for the loop to run again. 

In the previous iteration, `j` was `8`, and in the next iteration, `j` will be `8 + 3 = 11`, which is still less than 1,000,000. Thus, the loop will execute again.

However, for the loop to continue executing, we need to adjust the state of `j` to reflect its next value at the start of the next iteration.

Since `j` starts at `8` and will become `11` for the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of `j`.

No other states need to be adjusted as `n` and `a` do not affect the loop conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values except `a[8]`, which is now False; `i` is 3; `j` is 11**
