To analyze the loop and determine the output state, we need to consider how the loop modifies the list `a` and the values of `j`. The loop iterates over a range starting from `i ** 2 - 1` to `1,000,000`, increasing `j` by `i` (which is 3) in each iteration. 

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999.
   - `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` starts at `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `9 - 1 = 8`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - **First iteration**: `j` is 8. `a[8]` is set to False.
   - **Second iteration**: `j` is 11. `a[11]` is set to False.
   - **Third iteration**: `j` is 14. `a[14]` is set to False.
   - The loop continues incrementing `j` by 3 for each iteration until `j` reaches or exceeds 1,000,000.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.
   - If `i` is such that `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 8) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000, the loop will not execute at all.
   - Since `i` is fixed as 3, `i ** 2 - 1` is always 8, which is less than 1,000,000, so the loop will execute at least some times.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, every time `j` is calculated as `j = 8 + 3*k` (for k = 0, 1, 2, ... until `j` is < 1,000,000) will have `a[j]` set to False.
   - The indices that will be marked as False in the list `a` will be those starting from 8 and increasing by 3, i.e., 8, 11, 14, ..., up to the maximum index below 1,000,000.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `i` were to be less than 1, such that `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1 (not applicable here since `i` is always 3), the loop would not execute. 
   - If `n` had any specific relevance to the loop, it does not affect the execution since it is not used within the loop.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length 1,000,000 with True values except for indices 8, 11, 14, ..., and so on, up to the largest index less than 1,000,000 that can be reached by adding 3 repeatedly starting from 8; `i` is 3; `j` is the last value calculated before exceeding 1,000,000. If `i` were less than 1, then the loop would not execute and `a` would remain all True.**
