`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`, where `j` is 8. Therefore, `a[8]` changes from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unaffected in this operation. The output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values except `a[8]`, which is now False; `i` is 3; `j` is 8.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values except `a[8]`, which is now False; `i` is 3; `j` is 8**
