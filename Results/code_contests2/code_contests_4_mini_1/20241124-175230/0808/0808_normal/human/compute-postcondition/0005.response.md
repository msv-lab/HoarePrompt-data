To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided state and the loop statement step by step.

1. **Current state**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999.
   - `a[3]` is False.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 3.

2. **Loop statement**: 
   ```
   for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
   ```
   Here, `i ** 2 - 1` calculates to `2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`. The loop iterates `j` from 3 to just below 1,000,000 in steps of `i`, which is 2.

3. **Last iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3.
   - Since the loop condition starts from `j = 3`, `j` will take the values: 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., up to just below 1,000,000.

4. **Next iteration**:
   - The next value of `j` after 3 is `3 + 2 = 5`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` can take the next value, which is 5.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The variable `j` should be updated to 5 for the loop to continue executing.
   - The other variables (`n`, `a[3]`, and `i`) do not need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop's next execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect `j` being 5.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a[3]` is False; `i` is 2; `j` is 5**
