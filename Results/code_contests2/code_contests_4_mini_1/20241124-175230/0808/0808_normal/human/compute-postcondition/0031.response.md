Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values, and `i` is 4. If `a[3]` (which is `a[i - 1]`) is True, then all indices of `a` starting from `15` up to the maximum index reached by the loop before exceeding 1,000,000, and following the pattern of `j` values equal to `i ** 2 - 1 + k*i` for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., will be set to False. If `a[3]` is not True, the list `a` remains unchanged.***
