The statement `a[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` of the list `a`. Since `j` is 5, this means we are attempting to assign `False` to the 5th index of the list `a`. However, based on the initial state provided, `a` is defined only for the first 3 indices (0, 1, and 2) which means the index 5 is out of range for the list `a`. There are no changes made to the existing variables `n`, `i`, and `j`.

Thus, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[3]` is False; `i` is 2; `j` is 5 and the assignment to `a[j]` has no effect due to index out of range.**
