The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it processes multiple datasets as input. Each dataset consists of an integer `n`, which is constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999. The function likely performs operations on these datasets, returning results based on the values of `n`. However, the specific output format and results based on the processed datasets are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle up to 30 datasets where each dataset contains an integer `n` within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function processes up to 30 datasets, each containing an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, though the specific return values based on these inputs are not detailed.**
