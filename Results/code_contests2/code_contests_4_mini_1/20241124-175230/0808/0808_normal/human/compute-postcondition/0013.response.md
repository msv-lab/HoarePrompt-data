According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the values of `i` and the starting value for `j`, which is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`. Given that `i` is 3, the starting value for `j` will be `3 ** 2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8`. 

For the loop to execute, `j` must start at 8 and increment by `i` (which is 3) until it reaches 1,000,000. Since `j` starts at 8, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.

The current state of `n` does not affect the loop's execution directly, but we must ensure that the values remain within specified constraints. Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

The final state needs to reflect the adjusted value of `j`, which will be initialized to 8 before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values, `i` is 3, `j` is 8**
