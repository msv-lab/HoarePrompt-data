To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop conditions.

1. The loop iterates with `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and continues while `j` is less than 1,000,000, incrementing `j` by `i` in each iteration.
2. Given that `i` is 2, we can calculate the starting value of `j` for the next iteration:
   - The current value of `j` at the end of the last iteration would be `j = i ** 2 - 1 + i`.
   - Since `i` is 2, we calculate `i ** 2 - 1` which equals `4 - 1 = 3`. Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, `j` would be `3 + 2 = 5`.
3. The loop would continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. 

Now, we need to determine the values of `j` and ensure that it is still within the bounds for the loop to execute again. Since `j` at the end of the last iteration was 7, for the next iteration we need to increment `j` by the value of `i` (which is 2):
- Next value of `j` would be `7 + 2 = 9`.

So, the adjusted state should reflect that `j` is now 9 while the other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[3]` is False; `i` is 2; `j` is 9; `a[7]` is False**
