Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values. If `a[2]` is True (which it is since `i` is 3), the elements at indices 8, 11, 14, ..., up to the largest index less than 1,000,000 that can be reached by adding 3 repeatedly starting from 8 are set to False. If `a[2]` were False, the list `a` would remain unchanged, still filled with True values.***
