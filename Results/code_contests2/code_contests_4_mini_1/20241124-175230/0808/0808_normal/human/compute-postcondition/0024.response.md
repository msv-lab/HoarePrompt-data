The value of `a[j]` is set to `False`. The index `j` is 15, so the value at index 15 of the list `a`, which was initially `True`, is now changed to `False`. The values of `n`, `i`, and other elements of the list `a` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of length 1,000,000 with `a[15]` is False; `i` is 4; `j` is 15**
