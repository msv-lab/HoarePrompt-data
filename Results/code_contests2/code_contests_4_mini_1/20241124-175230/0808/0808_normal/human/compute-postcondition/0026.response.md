The code `a[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `j` of the list `a`. The variable `j` has a value of 19, so `a[19]` is set to `False`. The initial state of `a[15]` is already `False`, but it does not affect the assignment at `a[19]`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and the previous value of `a[19]` (which is unknown) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[15]` is False; `a[19]` is False; `i` is 4; `j` is 19.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[15]` is False; `a[19]` is False; `i` is 4; `j` is 19**
