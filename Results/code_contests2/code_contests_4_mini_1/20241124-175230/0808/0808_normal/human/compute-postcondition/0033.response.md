Output State: **After the loop executes, `a` will contain boolean values where `a[k]` is False for indices `k` that are multiples of any prime number less than 1000, starting from their square (i.e., `i^2 - 1`), and True for all other indices. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `a` remains a list of length 1,000,000 filled with True values. If `n` is 2, the loop executes from 2 up to 999, and `a` will have multiple indices set to False. If `n` is greater than 999, the loop will execute but will not affect indices beyond 999,000, and all indices up to 999,000 will be processed accordingly.**
