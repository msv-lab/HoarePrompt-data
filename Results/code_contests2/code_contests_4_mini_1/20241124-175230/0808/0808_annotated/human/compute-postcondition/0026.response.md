The statement `a[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` in the array `a`. Since `j` is 1, the state of the element `a[1]` is explicitly set to `False`. The initial state indicates that `a[j]` was already assigned `False`, which means this assignment does not change its value. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `a[j]` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `a[j]` is False**
