The code assigns the value `False` to `a[j]`, where `j` is 7. Since `a[5]` is already `False` and we have not been provided with the previous state of `a[7]`, we can only confirm that `a[7]` is now also `False`. The values of `n`, `a[3]`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `a[7]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a[3]` is False, `a[5]` is False, `a[7]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 7**
