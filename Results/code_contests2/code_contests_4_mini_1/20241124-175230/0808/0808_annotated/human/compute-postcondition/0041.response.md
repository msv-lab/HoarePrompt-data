Output State: **If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `a` remains a list of 1,000,000 `True` values. If n is at least 2, the loop executes for values of `i` starting from 2, and for each `i`, if `a[i - 1]` is `True`, it will mark multiples of `i` as `False` starting from `i^2 - 1` up to 999,999. The final state of `a` will depend on the prime numbers found in that range. The variable `s` will take input values from `sys.stdin`, and for each input, the count of `True` values in the sublist `a[1:int(s)]` is printed.**
