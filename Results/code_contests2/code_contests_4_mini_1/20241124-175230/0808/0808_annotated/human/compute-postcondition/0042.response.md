The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly; instead, it processes multiple datasets containing integers. Each dataset contains one integer `n`, which is constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 999,999\). The function handles up to 30 datasets. The output is determined by these datasets, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple datasets of integers within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets, each containing one integer n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, and handles up to 30 datasets.**
