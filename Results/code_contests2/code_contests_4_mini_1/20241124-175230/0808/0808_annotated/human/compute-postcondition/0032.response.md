According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop starts from `i = 2` and continues as long as `i` is less than `1,000,000`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `999,999`, which is still less than `1,000,000`, so the loop can execute one more time with `i` incremented by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `1,000,000`. There are no other states that need to be adjusted because the conditions for `n` and the array `a` do not affect the ability of the loop to execute again in this context.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 1,000,000**
