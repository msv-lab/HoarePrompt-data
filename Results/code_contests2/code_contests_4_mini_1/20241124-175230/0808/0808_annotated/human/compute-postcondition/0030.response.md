Output State: **`j` will take values starting from `i^2 - 1` and increment by `i` until it reaches 1,000,000. If `i^2 - 1` is greater than or equal to 1,000,000, then the loop will not execute and `a[j]` will not change. If `i` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once if `i^2 - 1` is less than 1,000,000. The final state of `a[j]` for all `j` set during the loop will be `False` for each `j` reached by the loop.**
