`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`, and since `j` is 3, this means that `a[3]` is set to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, with `a[3]` set to `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, with `a[3]` set to `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 3**
