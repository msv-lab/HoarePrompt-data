Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999 and `i` is 999,999. If `a[i - 1]` is true, `j` takes values starting from `i^2 - 1` and increments by `i` until it reaches 1,000,000. If `i^2 - 1` is less than 1,000,000, all values of `a[j]` for those `j` will be set to `False`. If `i^2 - 1` is greater than or equal to 1,000,000, the loop will not execute and the state of `a[j]` will remain unchanged.***
