The variable `a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. The initial state specifies that `a[j]` is already `False`, so there is no change in its value. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `a[j]` is False**
