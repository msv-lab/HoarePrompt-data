According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and the given range. The loop will execute if the starting value `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000, as the loop iterates from this value to 999,999 in increments of `i`. 

Given that `i` is 999,999, we calculate the starting value for `j`:
- `i ** 2 - 1` = 999,999 ** 2 - 1 = 999,998,000,001 - 1 = 999,998,000,000.

Since 999,998,000,000 is greater than 1000000, the loop will not execute. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the value of `i` to be less than or equal to 999, thus ensuring that `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000. 

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect `i` being a smaller integer, for instance, `i` can be set to 999. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 999, `j` is 999,998,000 - 1**
