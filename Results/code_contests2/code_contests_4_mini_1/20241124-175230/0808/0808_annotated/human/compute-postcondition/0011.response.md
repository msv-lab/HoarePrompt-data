Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values. If `a[i - 1]` is `True`, then for every index `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` up to the maximum value less than 1,000,000 stepping by `i`, the values of `a[j]` will be set to `False`. Specifically, for `i = 2`, odd indices such as `a[3]`, `a[5]`, `a[7]`, and so forth will be set to `False`, while if `i` is greater than 1000, the loop does not execute and `a` remains all `True`.***
