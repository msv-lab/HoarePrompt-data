According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 999,999. The loop condition specifies that it should iterate from `i ** 2 - 1` to 1,000,000, incrementing by `i`. 

To find the next value of `j`, we need to consider the increment: `j` will be updated by adding `i` to it (999). Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` will be:

```
j = 999,999 + 999 = 1,000,998
```

However, since 1,000,998 is greater than 1,000,000, the loop will not execute again. 

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `j` to be less than 1,000,000. The maximum value that `j` can take while still allowing the loop to execute one more time is 999,000, which means `j` should be set to 999,000 and `i` should remain unchanged. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is 999; `j` is 999,000; and `a[j]` is set to False.**
