The code assigns `False` to the index `j` of the list `a`. The current value of `j` is 5, so `a[5]` is set to `False`. The other variables, including `n`, `a[3]`, `i`, and the value of `a[5]` before assignment, do not change. Therefore, after execution, `a[5]` is `False`, `a[3]` remains `False`, `i` is 2, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a[3]` is False, `a[5]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
