You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students with at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, and `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values. The loop will execute for each integer `i` starting from 2 up to 999,999. For each `i`, if `a[i - 1]` is `True`, the inner loop will set `a[j]` to `False` for every index `j` that is a multiple of `i` starting from `i^2 - 1` up to 999,999. If `i^2 - 1` is greater than or equal to 1,000,000, the inner loop will not execute, and the state of `a` will remain unchanged for that value of `i`. If there are no values of `i` for which `a[i - 1]` is `True`, the outer loop will still iterate, but the inner loop will not change any values in `a`. Therefore, after the loop execution, `a` may contain `True` or `False` values depending on the multiples of the primes found up to 999,999, and the loop will not execute if `n` is less than 2, in which case `a` will remain a list of 1,000,000 `True` values.
```
for s in sys.stdin:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?
