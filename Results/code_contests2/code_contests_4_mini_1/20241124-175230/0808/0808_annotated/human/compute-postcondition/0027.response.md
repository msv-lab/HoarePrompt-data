According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` up to (but not including) 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` on each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means `i ** 2 - 1` evaluates to `0`. Therefore, the loop starts at `j = 0`.

Since `j` is currently 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2 on the next iteration, and since the loop increments `j` by `i`, which is 1, `j` will become 2.

The condition for the loop to run again is that `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Since `j` is currently 1, it will be incremented to 2, which satisfies the condition of `j < 1,000,000`.

No other states need to be adjusted because the other variables (`n` and `a[j]`) do not affect the execution of the loop directly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `a[j]` is False**
