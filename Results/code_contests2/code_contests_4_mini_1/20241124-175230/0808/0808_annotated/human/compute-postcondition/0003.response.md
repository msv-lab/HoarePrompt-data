To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the for loop structure and the initial conditions given.

1. The loop iterates with `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and continues until it reaches 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` on each iteration.
2. First, we calculate the starting point for `j`:
   - Given `i` is 2, we compute `i ** 2 - 1`, which results in `2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`.
3. Next, we check the conditions for the loop:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` starts at 3 and increments by `i` (which is 2) until it reaches 1,000,000.
   - The first value of `j` will be 3, and subsequent values will be 5, 7, 9, and so on, up to 1,000,000.

Since all the initial conditions are satisfied for the loop to execute, we note the following:

- `j` starts at 3.
- `i` is 2.
- The initial condition of `a` does not affect the loop execution in this case, as the loop does not reference `a`.

Thus, the adjusted states for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, all set to `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
