To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop.

1. The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
   ```

2. We need to find the starting point for `j`, which is `i ** 2 - 1`. Given that `i` is currently 2:
   - Calculate `i ** 2 - 1`: 
     - `2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`
   - Therefore, the loop starts at `j = 3`.

3. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000 and increments `j` by `i` (which is 2) each iteration.

4. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is currently 5. Since the loop increments `j` by `i` (2):
   - In the next iteration, `j` will be `5 + 2 = 7`.

5. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than 1,000,000 after the increment. Currently, `j` is 5, which is less than 1,000,000; thus, the loop will execute again.

6. The only adjustments we need to make are for `j`, which should be set to the next value to reflect the upcoming iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a[3]` is False, `a[5]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 7**
