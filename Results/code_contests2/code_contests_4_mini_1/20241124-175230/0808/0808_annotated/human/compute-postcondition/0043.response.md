Functionality: ** The function initializes a list `a` with 1,000,000 boolean values set to True, then uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers as False within this list for numbers up to 999,999. After processing, it reads integers from standard input, and for each integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999), it counts and prints the number of True values in the sublist `a[1:n]`, which corresponds to the count of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. If the input `n` is less than 2, it will only print the count of True values for that range, which will be equal to `n - 1` since indices 1 to `n` are all True for `n < 2`. The function does not return any value. **
