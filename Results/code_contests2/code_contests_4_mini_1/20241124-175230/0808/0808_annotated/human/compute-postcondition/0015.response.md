To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):`. The starting value of `j` is `i ** 2 - 1`, the stopping condition is 1000000, and the increment is `i`.

2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 999,998,000 - 1. 

3. We need to evaluate whether the loop can execute one more time. The condition for the loop to continue is that the next value of `j` must be less than 1000000.

4. The next value of `j` would be calculated as:
   - `j = 999,998,000 - 1 + i` 
   - Since `i` is 999, the next value of `j` becomes:
   - `j = 999,998,000 - 1 + 999 = 999,998,000`.

5. Now we check if this next value of `j` is less than 1000000:
   - `999,998,000` is not less than `1000000`, hence the loop cannot execute again.

6. To allow the loop to execute once more, we need to adjust the states:
   - We need `j` to be less than 1000000, which means we can set `j` to 999,999 (the maximum value less than 1000000).
   - Additionally, the starting point of `j` needs to be adjusted as `i ** 2 - 1` since we are using the same `i`.

7. Given that the loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1`, we can conclude:
   - If `i` remains 999, we can consider adjusting `n` such that it ensures that the loop could theoretically execute again.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect a valid condition for `j` to allow the loop to continue, which involves setting `j` to a value that is less than 1000000.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 999, `j` is 999,999**
