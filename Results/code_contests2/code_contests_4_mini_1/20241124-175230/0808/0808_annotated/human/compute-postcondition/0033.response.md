Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, and `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values. The loop will execute for each integer `i` starting from 2 up to 999,999. For each `i`, if `a[i - 1]` is `True`, the inner loop will set `a[j]` to `False` for every index `j` that is a multiple of `i` starting from `i^2 - 1` up to 999,999. If `i^2 - 1` is greater than or equal to 1,000,000, the inner loop will not execute, and the state of `a` will remain unchanged for that value of `i`. If there are no values of `i` for which `a[i - 1]` is `True`, the outer loop will still iterate, but the inner loop will not change any values in `a`. Therefore, after the loop execution, `a` may contain `True` or `False` values depending on the multiples of the primes found up to 999,999, and the loop will not execute if `n` is less than 2, in which case `a` will remain a list of 1,000,000 `True` values.**
