According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values of `i` and the range defined. The starting point of the loop is `i ** 2 - 1`, which calculates to `999,999 ** 2 - 1 = 999,998,000,000 - 1 = 999,998,999,999`. The loop will iterate until it reaches 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` (999,999) each time.

Since the starting point (999,998,999,999) is much greater than the ending point (1,000,000), the loop will not execute. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `i` such that `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1,000,000. Therefore, we can set `i` to a value that satisfies this condition, such as 1. This will make the starting point of the loop `1 ** 2 - 1 = 0`, which is less than 1,000,000, allowing the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
