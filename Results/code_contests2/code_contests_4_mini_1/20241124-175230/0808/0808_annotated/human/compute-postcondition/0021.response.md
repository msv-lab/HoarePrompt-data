Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999 and `i` is 999,999. If `a[i - 1]` is true, then for each `j` in the range from `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 999,998) to 1,000,000 with a step of `i` (999,999), the values of `a[j]` at indices 998,000, 998,999, and 999,998 are set to False. If `a[i - 1]` is false, or if `i ** 2` is greater than or equal to 1,000,000, the array `a` remains unchanged.***
