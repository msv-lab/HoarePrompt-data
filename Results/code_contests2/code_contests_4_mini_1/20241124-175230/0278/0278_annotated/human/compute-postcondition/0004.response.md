Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `V`, as well as two lists `a` and `b`, where `a` contains `n` positive floats and `b` contains `n` non-negative floats. It calculates a value based on the minimum of a computed expression involving elements from `a` and `b`. The function does not return any value explicitly, as it only prints the computed minimum value. Additionally, edge cases such as empty input or invalid formats are not handled, which may lead to runtime errors. **
