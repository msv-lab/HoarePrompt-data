The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 

1. `n`: an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \).
2. `V`: a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq V \leq 10000 \).
3. `a`: a list of `n` positive integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \).
4. `b`: a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer \( b_i \) satisfies \( 0 \leq b_i \leq 100 \).

The function does not have any specified output in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot summarize a return value based on the given details. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, V, a, and b, where n is an integer, V is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and b is a list of n non-negative integers. However, the return value of the function is not specified.**
