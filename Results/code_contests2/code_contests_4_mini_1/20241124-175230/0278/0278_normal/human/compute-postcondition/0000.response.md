The code assigns values to `n` and `V` by mapping the input from `raw_input()` to integers. The input is expected to be two integers separated by a space. Other variables `a` and `b` are not affected in this statement. Since the specific values of `n` and `V` are not provided, we can only state their potential ranges. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000**
