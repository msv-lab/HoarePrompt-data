The variables `a` and `b` are assigned values from two separate input lines. The first line of input will populate `a` with a list of floats based on the values provided, and the second line will populate `b` in the same manner. The initial states of `n` and `V` do not change, and the specific values of `a` and `b` depend on user input. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `V`, as well as the newly assigned lists `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000; `a` is a list of floats from first input; `b` is a list of floats from second input**
