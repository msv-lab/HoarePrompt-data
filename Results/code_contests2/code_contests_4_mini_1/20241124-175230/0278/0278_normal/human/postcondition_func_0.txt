The function reads two integers `n` and `V`, followed by two lists of `n` floating-point numbers `a` (positive) and `b` (non-negative), and computes a minimized result based on the ratios of `b[i]` to `a[i]`, scaled by `a[i]`, for all valid pairs, while not handling potential edge cases like division by zero or empty input lists.
