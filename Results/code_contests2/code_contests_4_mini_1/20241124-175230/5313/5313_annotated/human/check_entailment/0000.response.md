To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the logic and the provided problem description.

The program is designed to compute the minimum perimeter of a shape that encloses exactly `N` city blocks. The logic can be broken down as follows:

1. **Input**: The program reads a single integer `n`, which represents the area (or number of city blocks).
2. **Finding the Square Root**: It calculates `x` as the integer square root of `n`.
3. **Perfect Square Check**: If `n` is a perfect square (`x * x == n`), the perimeter is `4 * x`.
4. **Shape Calculation**:
   - If `x * (x + 1) > n`, it calculates the perimeter as `(x + x + 1) * 2`. This essentially means the perimeter is computed for a rectangular shape that has dimensions corresponding to `x` and a height of `x + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it sets the perimeter to `4 * (x + 1)`, representing a square or rectangular shape that can encompass the area while being as compact as possible.

Upon reviewing the logic, let's test some potential edge cases and examples:

1. **Case: n = 1**
   - The expected output is `4`. The program would calculate `x = 1`, and since `1` is a perfect square, it returns `4 * 1 = 4`. This is correct.

2. **Case: n = 2**
   - The expected output is `8`. The program calculates `x = 1`. It checks `1 * (1 + 1) > 2`, which is false, so it computes `4 * (1 + 1) = 8`. This is correct.

3. **Case: n = 3**
   - The expected output is `8`. The program calculates `x = 1`. It checks `1 * (1 + 1) > 3`, which is false, so it computes `4 * (1 + 1) = 8`. This is correct.

4. **Case: n = 5**
   - The expected output is `12`. The program calculates `x = 2`. It checks `2 * (2 + 1) > 5`, which is false, so it computes `4 * (2 + 1) = 12`. This is correct.

5. **Case: n = 6**
   - The expected output is `12`. The program calculates `x = 2`. It checks `2 * (2 + 1) > 6`, which is false, so it computes `4 * (2 + 1) = 12`. This is correct.

6. **Case: n = 10**
   - The expected output is `16`. The program calculates `x = 3`. It checks `3 * (3 + 1) > 10`, which is false, so it computes `4 * (3 + 1) = 16`. This is correct.

7. **Case: n = 11**
   - The expected output is `14`. The program calculates `x = 3`. It checks `3 * (3 + 1) > 11`, which is false, so it computes `4 * (3 + 1) = 16`. Here it should have checked if `11` can fit in a rectangle of size `3 * 4` with a perimeter of `14`, but it doesn't account for that properly when `x * (x + 1) > n` is not satisfied.

From these tests, we can see that the program fails for certain inputs where the perimeter is not correctly calculated. Specifically, for `n = 11`, the expected output is `14`, but the program incorrectly returns `16`. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
