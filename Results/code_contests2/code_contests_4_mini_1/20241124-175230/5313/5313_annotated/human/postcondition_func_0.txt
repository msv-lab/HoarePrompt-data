The function accepts an integer input `n` (which must be between 1 and 10^6) and calculates a value `answr` based on the relationship between `n` and its integer square root `x`. If `n` is a perfect square, it returns `answr` as `4 * x`. If `n` is not a perfect square and `x * (x + 1) > n`, it returns `answr` as `2 * (2 * x + 1)`. Otherwise, it returns `answr` as `4 * (x + 1)`. Finally, it prints `answr`. There is no handling for invalid input, which could cause the function to fail if a non-integer or out-of-bounds value is provided.
