In the provided snippet, `answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`. The initial state specifies that `x` is the integer square root of `n` and that `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`. 

Let's analyze the calculation:

1. `answr` is computed as `(x + x + 1) * 2`, which simplifies to `(2x + 1) * 2`.
2. This further simplifies to `4x + 2`.

The variables `N`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged after the assignment to `answr`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged states of `N`, `n`, and `x`, as well as the new value of `answr` calculated based on `x`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is `4x + 2`**
