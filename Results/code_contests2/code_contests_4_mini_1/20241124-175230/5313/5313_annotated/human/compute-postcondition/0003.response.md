The variable `answr` is assigned the value `x * 4`. Given that `x` is the integer square root of `n`, we can deduce that `n` is a perfect square, and therefore `x` is a positive integer such that `x^2 = n`. This means the output state will reflect the relationship between `n` and `x`, and will also include the calculated value of `answr`.

Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6), `x` will also be a positive integer, and `answr` will be equal to `4 * x`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * x`.**
