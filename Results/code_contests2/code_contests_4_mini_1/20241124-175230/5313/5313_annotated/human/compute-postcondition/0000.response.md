The value of `n` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1,000,000. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer**
