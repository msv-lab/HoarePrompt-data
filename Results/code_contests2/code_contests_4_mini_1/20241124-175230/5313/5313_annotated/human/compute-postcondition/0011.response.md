The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `int(answr)`, which converts `answr` to an integer type. The previous state of `answr` is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value or the effect of this conversion on other variables. Therefore, the output state simply reflects that `answr` has been converted to an integer.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is now an integer.**
