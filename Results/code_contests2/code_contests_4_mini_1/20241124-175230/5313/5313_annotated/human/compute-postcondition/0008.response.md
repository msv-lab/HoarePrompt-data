The variable `answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`. The value of `x` is previously defined as the integer square root of `n`, and it holds that `x * (x + 1)` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the value of `answr` depends directly on the value of `x`.

Since `x` is a positive integer and the square root of `n`, we can express `answr` in terms of `x`:
- If `x` is known, then `answr` can be calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`.

However, without a specific value for `x`, we cannot determine a numerical output for `answr`. Instead, we can state it in terms of `x`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; and `answr` is 4 * (x + 1)**
