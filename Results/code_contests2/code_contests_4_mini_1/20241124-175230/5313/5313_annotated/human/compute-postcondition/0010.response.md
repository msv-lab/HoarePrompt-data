Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`. If `x ** 2 == n`, then `answr` is equal to `4 * x`. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, then `answr` is computed as `4 * x + 2`. Otherwise, `answr` is equal to `4 * (x + 1)`. This ensures that `answr` is accurately calculated based on whether `n` is a perfect square or falls between two consecutive perfect squares, appropriately handling all edge cases within the defined constraints.***
