The `print(answr)` statement outputs the value of `answr` to the console. The values of the other variables (`N`, `n`, `x`) are not affected by this operation. However, since `answr` is now an integer, it retains its current value. The output state includes the values of all variables, noting that `answr` is printed.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is now an integer and is printed**.
