The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, which is the integer square root of `n`. Since `n` is an input integer, its specific value will be used to calculate `x`. The values of `N` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n**
