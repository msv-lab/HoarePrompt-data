To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

Initial State: *`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an integer within that range; `x` is the integer value of the square root of `n`; and the product of `x` and `(x + 1)` is greater than `n`.

The code snippet:
```
answr = (x + x + 1) * 2
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The variable `x` represents the integer square root of `n`.
2. The expression `(x + x + 1)` simplifies to `(2x + 1)`.
3. The entire expression evaluates to `answr = (2x + 1) * 2`, which simplifies to `answr = 4x + 2`.

Since `x` is derived from `n`, which is a positive integer within the specified range, and `x` must also adhere to the conditions stated, we can conclude that `answr` is defined in terms of `x` but does not affect the values of `N`, `n`, or `x`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an integer within that range; `x` is the integer value of the square root of `n`; `answr` is defined as `4x + 2`.**
