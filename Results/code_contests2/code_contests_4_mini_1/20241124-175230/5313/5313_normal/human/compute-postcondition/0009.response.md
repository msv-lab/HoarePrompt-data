Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an integer within that range; `x` is the integer value of the square root of `n`. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, then `answr` is calculated as `4x + 2`. Otherwise, `answr` is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`. This ensures that all possible cases for `n` and `x` within the given bounds are considered.***
