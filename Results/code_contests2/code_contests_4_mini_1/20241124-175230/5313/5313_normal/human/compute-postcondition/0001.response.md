The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, where `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^6. The calculation involves taking the square root of `n` and converting it to an integer. The output state will reflect the current values of `N`, `n`, and the newly computed value of `x`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within that range; `x` is the integer value of the square root of `n`.**
