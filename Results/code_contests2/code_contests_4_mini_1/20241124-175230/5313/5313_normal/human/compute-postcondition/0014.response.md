The function `func` accepts an integer input `n` from the user, which is expected to be a positive integer within the range 1 to 1,000,000. It calculates the integer square root `x` of `n` and uses it to determine a variable `answr` based on certain conditions related to the value of `n`. 

If `n` is a perfect square (i.e., `x ** 2 == n`), it sets `answr` to `4 * x`. If `n` is not a perfect square, it further checks if `x * (x + 1) > n`. If this condition is true, `answr` is set to `2 * (x + x + 1)`. If this condition is false, it sets `answr` to `4 * (x + 1)`.

Finally, the function converts `answr` to an integer (though it is already an integer from the calculations) and prints it.

The return postconditions were not provided, but the function does not return a value; it only prints the result. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer input `n`, calculates its integer square root `x`, and prints a computed value `answr` based on whether `n` is a perfect square or not, as well as other conditions involving `x`. The function does not return any values; it only outputs the result. **
