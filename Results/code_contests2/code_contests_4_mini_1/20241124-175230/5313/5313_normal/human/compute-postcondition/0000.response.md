The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `N` is a positive integer within the specified range, the value of `n` will also be a positive integer between 1 and 10^6. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within that range.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within that range**
