The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. The initial state indicates that `x` is equal to the integer value of the square root of `n`, and since `n` is a perfect square (as stated that the square of `x` is equal to `n`), `x` will be a positive integer.

Thus, `answr` will be calculated as `x * 4`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^6, and `x` is the square root of `n`, the value of `answr` will depend on the specific value of `x`.

The output state will reflect that `answr` is equal to `x * 4`, where `x` is the positive integer equal to the integer value of the square root of `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within that range; `x` is a positive integer equal to the integer value of the square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `x * 4`.**
