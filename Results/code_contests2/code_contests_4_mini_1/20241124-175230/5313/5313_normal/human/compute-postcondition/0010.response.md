Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an integer within that range; `x` is the integer value of the square root of `n`. If `x ** 2` equals `n`, then `answr` is equal to `x * 4`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, then `answr` is equal to `(4 * x + 2)`. Otherwise, `answr` is equal to `4 * (x + 1)`. This ensures that all possible cases for `n` and `x` within the given bounds are handled, including cases where `n` is a perfect square, just less than a perfect square, or between two consecutive squares.***
