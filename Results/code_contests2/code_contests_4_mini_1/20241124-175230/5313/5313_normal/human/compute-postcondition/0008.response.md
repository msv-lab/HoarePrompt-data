The variable `answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`. The value of `x` is previously defined as the integer value of the square root of `n`, and it satisfies the condition `x * (x + 1) ≤ n`. Therefore, `answr` will be calculated based on the value of `x`. 

The output state does not change the values of `N`, `n`, or `x`, but it defines a new variable `answr` based on the current value of `x`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within that range; `x` is the integer value of the square root of `n`; and `answr` is 4 * (x + 1)**
