To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description and the output hints, let's break down the task.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to calculate the minimum perimeter of a route that encloses exactly N city blocks. The perimeter should be minimized based on the configuration of these blocks, laid out in a square grid.

### Program Analysis
Let's analyze the program:

```python
import math

n = int(input())
x = int(n ** 0.5)
if x ** 2 == n:
    answr = x * 4
elif x * (x + 1) > n:
    answr = (x + x + 1) * 2
else:
    answr = 4 * (x + 1)
answr = int(answr)
print(answr)
```

- The program reads an integer `n`.
- It calculates `x` as the integer square root of `n`.
- It checks if `n` is a perfect square (i.e., `x * x == n`) and computes the perimeter as `x * 4`.
- If `n` is not a perfect square, it checks if `x * (x + 1) > n` to compute the perimeter.
- If neither condition is met, it defaults to `4 * (x + 1)`.

### Edge Cases
1. **Perfect Squares**: The program correctly computes the perimeter for perfect squares.
2. **Non-Perfect Squares**: The logic for the non-perfect squares might not always yield the minimum perimeter. For example, while it checks for `x * (x + 1) > n`, it may not adequately cover all configurations of blocks that minimize perimeter.
3. **Small Values of N**: For `N = 1`, the perimeter should be `4` (1x1 square). The code handles this correctly.
4. **Large Values of N**: When `N` approaches `10^6`, the logic needs to be validated against known optimal configurations.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints state that the function accepts a positive integer input `n`, calculates its integer square root `x`, and outputs a computed value `answr`. These hints align with the implementation, but they don't confirm the correctness of the perimeter calculations.

### Verification Against Examples
1. **For N = 4**: The output is `8`, which is correct as the perimeter of a 2x2 square is `8`.
2. **For N = 11**: The output is `14`, which is correct for a rectangle of dimensions 3x4 (perimeter is `14`).
3. **For N = 22**: The output is `20`, which is correct for a rectangle of dimensions 5x5, as the perimeter is `20`.

### Conclusion
While the code appears to handle the provided examples correctly, the logic for calculating the perimeter for non-perfect squares may not cover all configurations optimally. Notably, the conditions may miss configurations that yield a smaller perimeter than calculated.

Since the code does not guarantee correctness for all potential configurations and edge cases based on the described logic, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
