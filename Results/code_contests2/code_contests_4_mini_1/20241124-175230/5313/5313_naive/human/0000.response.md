To verify the program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description, which requires calculating the minimum perimeter of a shape that encloses exactly N city blocks.

The provided program attempts to compute the minimum perimeter based on the following logic:

1. It calculates the integer square root `x` of `n`.
2. It checks if `x**2` equals `n`, which would mean `n` is a perfect square, in which case it returns the perimeter of a square with side length `x`, which is `4 * x`.
3. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, it calculates the perimeter for a rectangle that has one side length `x` and the other side length `x + 1`, returning `(x + x + 1) * 2`.
4. If neither of the above conditions are met, it calculates the perimeter for a rectangle that has both side lengths equal to `x + 1`, returning `4 * (x + 1)`.

Now let's examine edge cases and potential issues:

1. **Perfect Squares**: When `n` is a perfect square (like 1, 4, 9, 16...), the program correctly computes the perimeter as `4 * x`.
2. **Cases just above perfect squares**: For example, when `n = 10`, the program computes `x = 3`, and since `3 * (3 + 1) = 12` is not greater than `10`, it defaults to the last condition calculating `4 * (3 + 1) = 16`. However, the actual minimum perimeter for enclosing 10 blocks is `18` from a 2x5 rectangle.
3. **Rectangles**: The logic does not consider all possible rectangle configurations for values of `n` that are not perfect squares. 

This reveals an inconsistency in calculating the perimeter and leads us to conclude that there are cases where the program does not return the expected minimum perimeter.

For instance, testing with `n = 10` shows that the program returns `16`, while the correct minimum perimeter should be `18`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be summarized as follows:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to compute the correct minimum perimeter for certain values of `n`, particularly when `n` is not a perfect square but falls within a range that could be enclosed by various rectangle configurations.
