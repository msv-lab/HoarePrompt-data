The code checks if the sum `s` is equal to 0 or if the sum `s` modulo the length of the list `c` is not equal to 0. If either condition is true, it will print `-1`. If neither condition is true, it calculates the average by dividing `s` by the length of `c`. The specific details of `c` and `s` are not provided; hence, the output state will reflect the conditions based on `s` and `len(c)`.

Output State: **`c` is a list of integers from user input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `c`, and the output is -1 if `s` is 0 or `s % len(c) != 0`, otherwise the output is `s / len(c)`**
