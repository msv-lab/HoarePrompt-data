Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and calculates the sum of these integers. It returns -1 if the sum is zero or if the sum is not evenly divisible by the count of the integers. Otherwise, it returns the average of the integers (the sum divided by the count). Note that the function does not handle cases where no integers are provided in the input, which could lead to a division by zero error. **
