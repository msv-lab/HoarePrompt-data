The function `func` does not accept any parameters as it is defined without any arguments. Based on the provided constraints, the function operates with five integer variables, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`, all of which are within the range of 0 to 100. Since the output details are not provided, we cannot specify the return values or behaviors based on the inputs. Therefore, we conclude that the function does not take any external parameters.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It operates internally with five integers c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5, each constrained between 0 and 100. The specific return value or behavior is not defined.**
