The variable `s` is assigned the value of the sum of the list `c`. The list `c` contains integers from user input, all in the range 0 to 100. Therefore, `s` will be the sum of all integers in the list `c`. The specific value of `s` depends on the values present in the list `c`, but since we don't have the actual input, we cannot determine an exact numerical value for `s`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the current state of `c` and the computed `s`.

Output State: **`c` is a list of integers from user input, where each integer is in the range 0 to 100; `s` is the sum of the elements in `c`**.
