The line of code assigns the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to `c`. The `raw_input()` function accepts a space-separated string of integers from the user input, and `map(int, ...)` converts each of those string representations into integers. The initial state indicates that `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are integers within the range of 0 to 100, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `c` will now hold the integer values from the input, which can be any combination of integers within the specified range.

Output State: **`c` is a list of integers from user input, where each integer is in the range 0 to 100**.
