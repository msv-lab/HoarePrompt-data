To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's recap the requirements:

**Problem description**: We need to determine the initial bet \( b \) based on the final number of coins \( c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 \) that each of the five players has at the end of the game. The function should return the positive integer \( b \) if possible, or -1 if such \( b \) cannot exist.

**Program**:
```python
c = map(int, raw_input().split())
s = sum(c)
print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

### Initial Assessment

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a line of input and splits it into five integers. This aligns with the problem description.
2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total sum \( s \) of the coins. This is essential since the total coins distributed at the beginning must equal \( 5b \) (where \( b \) is the initial bet).
3. **Conditions to Check**:
   - If the sum \( s \) is zero, it returns -1. This is correct since if all players have 0 coins, there cannot be a positive initial bet.
   - If \( s \) is not divisible by the number of players (5), it returns -1. This is also correct, as \( b \) must be an integer and \( 5b = s \).
   - If neither condition is true, it computes \( b \) as \( s / 5 \).

### Edge Cases Considered

- The program does not explicitly handle the case where fewer than five integers are provided. However, the problem guarantees that there are always five integers to analyze, as indicated by the problem description.
- The program correctly checks for a sum of zero and divisibility by 5, which are critical to determining the validity of \( b \).

### Output Hints

The output hints state:
- The function reads a line of input and calculates the sum.
- It returns -1 if the sum is zero or not evenly divisible by 5.
- It returns the average of the integers if valid.

The output hints agree with the logic of the program and correctly highlight the conditions for returning -1 and computing \( b \).

### Final Conclusion

Given the analysis:
- The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description.
- It manages edge cases related to the input conditions stated in the problem description.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description and matches the output hints, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
