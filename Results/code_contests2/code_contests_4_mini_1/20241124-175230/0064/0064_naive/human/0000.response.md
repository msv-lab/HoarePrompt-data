To analyze the provided program against the problem description, let's break it down.

The problem requires us to determine the initial bet `b` for each player based on the final number of coins `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5`. The conditions for finding `b` are:
1. Each player must have started with `b` coins.
2. The total coins at the end must equal `5b` since there are five players.
3. If the total number of coins is zero, the output should be `-1` as there cannot be a positive `b`.

The program provided is:
```python
c = map(int, raw_input().split())
s = sum(c)
print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

### Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads a line of input and splits it into five integers representing the coins for each player.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The total number of coins is calculated using `sum(c)`.

3. **Conditions for Output**:
   - It checks if the sum `s` is zero. If so, it prints `-1`, which is correct.
   - It checks if `s` is divisible by the number of players (which is `5`). If not, it outputs `-1`. This captures the scenario where an equal distribution of coins is not possible.

4. **Final Calculation of `b`**: If the checks pass, it computes `s / len(c)` which should give `s / 5`. 

### Edge Cases:

- If all players have `0` coins, the output should be `-1` (as per the problem description), and the program handles this correctly.
- If players have various distributions of coins, the program checks if the total is divisible by `5`. 
- However, if the total number of coins is less than `5`, the program will still output a positive integer `b` even though it is not possible for each player to have started with at least `1` coin. For example, if the input is `1 1 1 0 0`, the total is `3`, and `3 / 5` would result in `0.6`, which would be incorrect.

Thus, the program is failing to account for the requirement that `b` must be a positive integer. It does not ensure that `s` must be at least `5` (since each player must have a positive initial bet).

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle edge cases correctly where the total number of coins is less than `5`. Therefore, it's not correct for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
