To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Summary
The task is to determine the initial bet size `b`, given the final number of coins each player has after playing the game. Each player initially bets `b` coins, and the total number of coins after all transfers must satisfy certain conditions.

### Code Analysis
The code provided is as follows:
```python
def func():
    c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    s = sum(c)
    print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

- The line `c = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads five integers from input, representing the number of coins for each player at the end of the game.
- `s = sum(c)` calculates the total number of coins that the five players have at the end.
- The next line checks two conditions:
  - If `s == 0`: This means that all players have zero coins. Since each player should have initially bet some positive number of coins (`b`), if the total is zero, it returns `-1`.
  - If `s % len(c) != 0`: Since there are 5 players (as implied by `len(c)`), this checks if the total number of coins is divisible by 5. If it isn't, it indicates that it is impossible to have reached this total from equal initial bets, so it returns `-1`.
- If neither condition is met, it computes `s / len(c)`, which gives the value of `b` as the average number of coins per player.

### Evaluation of Code Logic
1. **Handling of Zero Coins**: The code correctly identifies when all players have zero coins and returns `-1`, as it is impossible for them to have started with a positive bet.
2. **Divisibility Check**: The check for `s % len(c) != 0` ensures that the total coins must be divisible by the number of players. This is correct because each player must have started with the same initial bet.
3. **Output**: The code outputs the average bet size if the conditions are satisfied.

### Edge Cases
1. **All Players Have Zero Coins**: Input: `0 0 0 0 0` → Output: `-1` (correct)
2. **Sum Not Divisible by 5**: Input: `1 2 3 4 5` → Output: `-1` (correct, sum is 15, which is divisible by 5)
3. **Valid Case**: Input: `2 5 4 0 4` → Output: `3` (correct, sum is 15, each player can have started with 3)
4. **Another Valid Case**: Input: `4 5 9 2 1` → Output: `-1` (correct, sum is 21, which is not divisible by 5)

### Conclusion
The logic of the program adheres to the requirements set out in the problem description. All necessary checks are in place to ensure that the output is either a valid initial bet or `-1` when it is impossible to have such an initial bet.

Thus, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
