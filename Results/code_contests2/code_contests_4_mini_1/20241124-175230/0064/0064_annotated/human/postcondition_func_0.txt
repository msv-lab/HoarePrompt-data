The function reads a series of integers from user input, calculates their sum, and determines if the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of integers. If the sum is zero or not evenly divisible, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the average of the integers. Note that the function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
