To evaluate the provided code snippet, we first analyze the initial state of the variables and then the effect of the code.

- We have `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` which are integers within the range 0 to 100.
- `c` is a list containing the values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`.
- `s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`.

Now considering the code:
```
print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

1. The code checks if `s` is equal to 0. If it is, the output will be -1.
2. If `s` is not 0, it checks if `s` modulo the length of `c` (which is 5) is not equal to 0. If this condition is true, it also outputs -1.
3. If both conditions are false, it calculates `s / len(c)` which is `s / 5`.

Now, let's summarize the output state based on these evaluations:

1. If `s` is 0, then the output state would indicate that `s` is 0 and the output is -1.
2. If `s` is not 0, but not divisible by 5 (i.e., `s % 5 != 0`), then the output state would indicate that `s` is not divisible by 5 and the output is -1.
3. If `s` is not 0 and is divisible by 5 (i.e., `s % 5 == 0`), then the output state would indicate the computed value of `s / 5`.

Thus, the output state will depend on the specific values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`. However, without specific values, it can only be stated in general terms.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers such that 0 ≤ `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` ≤ 100; `s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`; if `s == 0`, output -1; if `s % 5 != 0`, output -1; else output `s / 5`.**
