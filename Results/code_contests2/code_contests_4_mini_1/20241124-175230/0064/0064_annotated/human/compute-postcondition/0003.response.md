The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with five integer variables: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`, each of which must satisfy the constraint that they are within the range of 0 to 100 (inclusive). The function does not return any specific output based on these variables as no output conditions are provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to utilize the integer variables `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` within the defined constraints without returning a value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with five integers c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5, each constrained to the range 0 to 100 inclusive. It does not return any value.**
