The expression inside the print statement calculates the position of the least significant '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Given that `j` is initially 0, `j + 1` equals 1. The binary representation of 1 is '1'. When reversed, it remains '1'. The find method looks for the first occurrence of '1', which is at index 0. Adding 1 to this index gives us 1.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the printed result is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the printed result is 1**
