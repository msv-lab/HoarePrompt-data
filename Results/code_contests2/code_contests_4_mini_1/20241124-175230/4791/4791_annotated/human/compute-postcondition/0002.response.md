According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. The `range(n)` function requires `n` to be an integer; however, in the given state, `n` is an input string, which causes a type mismatch error. To ensure that the loop can execute, `n` must be converted to an integer that is within the valid range for the loop to run, which is between 2 and 500 (inclusive).

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `n` must be an integer value (between 2 and 500), and the variable `j` should start at 0 (the initial value for the loop index).

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `j` is 0**
