According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 499, it guarantees that the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will take on values from 0 to `n-1`. 

For the loop to be executed correctly, `j` needs to be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 0**
