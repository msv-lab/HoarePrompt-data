According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is non-zero (truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 499, which means it is currently greater than 0. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time without needing any adjustments to `n`. The variable `j` is also defined as being from 0 to `n-1`, which is consistent with the current state.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is from 0 to `n-1`**
