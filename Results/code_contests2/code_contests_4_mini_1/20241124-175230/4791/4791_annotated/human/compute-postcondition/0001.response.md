The operation `n -= 1` is attempting to decrement `n`, which is an input string. Since `n` is a string, this operation is not valid for string types and will lead to an error. However, if we consider the intention behind the decrement operation, it suggests that `n` was expected to be a numeric type instead of a string.

Given that the initial state specifies `n` is an input string, the output state should reflect that no valid operation can be performed on the string `n`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string, and the operation is invalid due to type mismatch**.
