The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`, and for each value of `j`, it computes the index of the least significant '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`. The printed result will be the position of this '1', which is always 1 or greater since `j` starts from `0` and `j + 1` will be at least `1`.

If `n` is `0`, the loop will not execute at all, and hence there will be no printed results. 

Considering these points, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the printed results will be the indices of the least significant '1' in the binary representations of numbers from `1` to `n`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and there are no printed results.**
