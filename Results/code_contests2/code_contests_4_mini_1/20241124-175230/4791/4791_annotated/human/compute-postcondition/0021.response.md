The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 499, after the operation, `n` will be between 0 and 498. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 0 and 498, `j` is from 0 to `n-1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 498, `j` is from 0 to `n-1**
