According to the code, the loop executes as long as `n` is non-zero (truthy). The state mentions that if `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, the loop executes `n` times. Since the output of the print statement for each iteration is always 1, we can conclude that the loop is designed to execute while `n` is valid.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, which means it is currently non-zero. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must stay non-zero. Therefore, we do not need to make any adjustments to the state because `n` is already valid and will allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 500**
