To analyze the code snippet:

1. The value of `j` is 2.
2. Calculate `j + 1`, which results in `3`.
3. Convert `3` to its binary representation: `bin(3)` results in `'0b11'`.
4. Reverse the string representation: `'0b11'[::-1]` gives `'11b0'`.
5. Use the `find('1')` method to locate the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed binary string `'11b0'`, which is at index `0`.
6. Add `1` to the result of `find('1')`, yielding `0 + 1 = 1`.

Since the printed result is `2`, it indicates that the output is not based on the calculated values but is a fixed output.

Therefore, the output state is `n is greater than 1, j is 2, and the printed result is 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and the printed result is 2**
