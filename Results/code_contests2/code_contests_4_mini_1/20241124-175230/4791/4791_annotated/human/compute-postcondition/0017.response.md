The code calculates the binary representation of `j + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`. The binary representation of 3 is `11`. The code then reverses this string to get `11` (which remains the same when reversed) and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is at index 0. Adding 1 to this index results in 1. 

The printed value is 2, which is not affected by any variable changes. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 499, `j` is 2, and the printed value is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 499, `j` is 2, and the printed value is 2**
