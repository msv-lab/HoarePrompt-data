Output State: **If `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, the loop executes `n` times, where `j` takes values from 0 to `n-1`. The output of the print statement for each iteration is always 1 since it finds the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`. If `n` is less than 2 or greater than 500, the loop does not execute, and `j` is not defined. In that case, `N` would still be an integer between 2 and 500, and `n` would be invalid (not an integer).**
