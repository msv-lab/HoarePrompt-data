According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `n` is at least 2, it will still satisfy the condition `j < n` even when `j` is 2.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `j` is now 2, while `N` and `n` remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1**
