The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1]` converts `j + 1` to its binary representation, reverses it, and then uses `.find('1')` to locate the index of the first occurrence of '1'. Since `j` is 2, `j + 1` equals 3. The binary representation of 3 is `'11'`. When reversed, it becomes `'11'`. The first occurrence of '1' is at index 0, so adding 1 to it gives us 1. The output of the print statement is therefore 1. 

The values of `N`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1**
