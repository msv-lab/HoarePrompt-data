The value of `n` is decremented by 1, and since `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, the new value of `n` will be an integer between 1 and 499. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `n` is now decremented by 1, resulting in a new value of `n` between 1 and 499.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499**
