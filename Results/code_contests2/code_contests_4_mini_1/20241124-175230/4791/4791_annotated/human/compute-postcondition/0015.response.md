The code prints the result of the expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. The value of `j` is 1, so we first calculate `j + 1`, which is 2. The binary representation of 2 is '10'. 

Reversing this string gives us '01'. The `find('1')` method looks for the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. The index of the first '1' in '01' is 1. We then add 1 to this index, resulting in 2. 

The value of `n` and the printed value are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 1, and the printed value is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 1, and the printed value is 2**
