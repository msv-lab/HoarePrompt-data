According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop iterates while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3, which means `n` must be greater than 3 (since `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue executing). To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `j` is 2**
