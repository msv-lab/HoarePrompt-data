According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration, and `n` remains unchanged as it is still greater than 0. 

Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to reflect the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the printed result is 1**
