According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the integer `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 499. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3, and `n` must be at least 3 (since `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to run again). 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `n` is at least 3 and `j` is 3. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 499, `j` is 3**
