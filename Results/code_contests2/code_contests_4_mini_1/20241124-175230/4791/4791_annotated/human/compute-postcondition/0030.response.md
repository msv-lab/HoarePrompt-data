According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero (i.e., greater than 0), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `n` is greater than 0, which indicates that the loop can indeed execute one more time without any adjustments needed.

State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the printed results will be the indices of the least significant '1' in the binary representations of numbers from `1` to `n`.**
