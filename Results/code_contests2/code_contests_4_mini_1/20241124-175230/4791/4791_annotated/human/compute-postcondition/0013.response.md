The code calculates the position of the least significant bit that is set to 1 in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 0, the expression `j + 1` evaluates to 1. The binary representation of 1 is `'1'`. Reversing this string gives `'1'`, and the `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is 0. Adding 1 to this result gives 1.

The value of `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 0, and the printed value is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 0, and the printed value is 1**
