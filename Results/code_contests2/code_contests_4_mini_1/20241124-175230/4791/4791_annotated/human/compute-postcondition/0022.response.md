According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `j` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`. Since `n` can be between 0 and 498, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 to allow for at least one iteration of the loop. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `n` must be at least 1, and `j` should start at 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
