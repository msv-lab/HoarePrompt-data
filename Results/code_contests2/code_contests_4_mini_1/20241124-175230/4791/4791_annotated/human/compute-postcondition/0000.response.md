The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input as a string. The previous state indicates that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), but since `n` is reassigned to the result of `input()`, `N` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `N` is still an integer between 2 and 500, while `n` is now an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string**
