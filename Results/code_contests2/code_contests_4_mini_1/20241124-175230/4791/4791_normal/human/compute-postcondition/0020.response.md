According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, which allows for the loop to execute multiple times. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must remain greater than 0.

Since `n` is currently at least 1, no adjustments are needed for `j`, as it will continue to increment during the loop's executions. Thus, the state can simply be repeated without any modifications.

State: **`n` is at least 1**
