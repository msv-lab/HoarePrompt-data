According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `j` should become 2. Also, `n` must be greater than 2 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the printed value is 1**
