The value of `j` is 2. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to `3`. The binary representation of `3` is `0b11`. When reversed, it becomes `11`. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed binary string, which is at index `0`. Adding `1` to this index results in a value of `1`. 

The states of the other variables (`N`, `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is the integer representation of `N`, `j` is 2, and the print statement outputs `1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is the integer representation of `N`, `j` is 2, and the print statement outputs 1**
