The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided output statement, so it remains unclear what the function returns or performs based on `N`. Therefore, without additional information on the output or the operations performed based on `N`, we cannot accurately describe the functionality of the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters; however, it operates under the constraint that N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). The specific return value or functionality based on this constraint is not defined.**
