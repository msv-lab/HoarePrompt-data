According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for a number of iterations equal to the integer value of `n`. Since `n` is a string representation of the integer `N`, it needs to be converted to an integer before it can be used in the range function.

Given that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` must be a string that correctly represents this integer. The loop will execute `N` times, meaning `n` should be set to the string representation of `N`, and `j` should start at 0.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is the string representation of `N`, `j` is 0**
