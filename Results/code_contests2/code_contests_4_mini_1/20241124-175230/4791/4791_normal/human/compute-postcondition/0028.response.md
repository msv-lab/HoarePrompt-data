According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2, which means the loop can execute again. 

To allow for one more iteration of the loop, `j` must be incremented by 1. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 3. Since `n` is greater than 2, it remains unchanged as it still satisfies the loop condition.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, and the printed value is 1**
