`n` is a string input of an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). The operation `n -= 1` is attempting to subtract 1 from `n`, which is a string. This operation is invalid in Python, as we cannot directly subtract an integer from a string. Therefore, the output state is that `n` remains unchanged, and the operation cannot be performed. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a string input of that integer, and the operation `n -= 1` cannot be performed.**
