The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is the integer representation of `N`, which is between 2 and 500, the new value of `n` will be between 1 and 499. The variable `j` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is now between 1 and 499; `j` is between 0 and `n-1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is now between 1 and 499; `j` is between 0 and `n-1**
