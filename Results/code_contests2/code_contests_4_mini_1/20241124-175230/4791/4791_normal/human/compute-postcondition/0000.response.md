The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a user input. Since `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, the value of `n` will be a string representation of that integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and `n` is a string input of that integer.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a string input of that integer**
