The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and then adds 1 to that position. 

Given that `j` is 0, `j + 1` equals 1. The binary representation of 1 is `'0b1'`, and reversing this gives `'1b0'`. The `find('1')` method locates the first '1', which is at index 0. Adding 1 to this index results in 1.

The other variable `n` remains unaffected by the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1**
