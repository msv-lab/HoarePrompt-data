Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, then the loop executes `n` times with `j` taking values from 0 to `n-1`. The printed values correspond to the position of the least significant '1' bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to `n`. If `n` is 0 or lower (which isn't expected given the initial state), the loop does not execute, and `j` remains 0. In this case, the output will not be printed.**
