The code executes a print statement that calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and then adds 1 to that position. 

1. `j` is 2, so `j + 1` equals 3.
2. The binary representation of 3 is `11`.
3. Reversing this gives `11` (it remains the same because it's symmetrical).
4. The position of the first '1' in the reversed binary string `11` is at index 0.
5. Adding 1 to this index gives us 1.

The print statement outputs this value, but it does not change the state of any variables. The return statement is also unaffected.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, the function returns 2, and the printed value is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, the function returns 2, and the printed value is 1**
