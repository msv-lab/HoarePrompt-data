The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` is evaluated. Since `j` is 0, `j + 1` equals 1. The binary representation of `1` is `'0b1'`. When we take the reverse of this string (excluding the `'0b'` prefix), we get `'1'`. The `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of `'1'`, which is `0`. Adding `1` gives us `1`. 

The initial state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is the string representation of `N`, `j` is 0, and the print statement outputs `1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is the string representation of `N`, `j` is 0, and the print statement outputs 1**.
