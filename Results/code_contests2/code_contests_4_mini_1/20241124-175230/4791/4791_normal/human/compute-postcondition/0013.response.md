The value of `j` is 0. When we execute `j + 1`, it results in 1. The `bin(1)` function converts this to the binary string `'0b1'`. When we reverse this string with `[::-1]`, it becomes `'1b0'`. The `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is 0. Adding 1 to this index gives us 1. The other variables `N` and `n` remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is between 1 and 499, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1**.
