According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that if `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute n times, which implies that `n` was reduced during the loop. Since the loop runs while `n` is non-zero, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must currently be greater than 0. 

As the specific state of `n` at the end of the last iteration is not detailed, we can only repeat the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 for the next iteration to occur, without making any assumptions about its exact value.

State: **if n is greater than 0**
