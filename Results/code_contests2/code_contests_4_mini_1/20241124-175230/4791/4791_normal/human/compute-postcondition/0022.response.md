According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Since the current state indicates that `n` is at least 0, it does not ensure that the loop will execute. For the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0. Additionally, the variable `j` needs to be initialized at the start of the loop. Therefore, we can set `j` to 0 to indicate the starting index of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
