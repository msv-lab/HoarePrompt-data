According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is truthy. In this context, `n` is an integer representation of `N`, which means it must be non-zero for the loop to run. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer representation of `N`, and since `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` must also be greater than 0.

Therefore, since `n` is already valid and will remain valid as long as `N` is unchanged, there are no states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is the integer representation of `N`, `j` is between 0 and `n-1`**
