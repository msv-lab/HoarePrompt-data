According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is the integer representation of `N`, which is between 2 and 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3. 

Since `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` must also be at least 3 to allow for at least one more iteration of the loop (because `j` will be 3 in the next iteration). Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 3.

State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 500, `n` is at least 3, `j` is 3, and the print statement outputs 1**
