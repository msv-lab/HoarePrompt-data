Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and prompts for user input. If the input is a positive integer `N` (between 2 and 500), it decrements `n` from `N` down to 0 while printing the position of the least significant '1' bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to `N-1` during each iteration. If the input is invalid (non-integer or out of range), the function does not execute the loop, and no output is produced. The function does not return any value. **
