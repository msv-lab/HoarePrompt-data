The expression `bin(j + 1)` computes the binary representation of `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 1, `j + 1` equals 2. The binary representation of 2 is `0b10`. The slicing `[::-1]` reverses this string, resulting in `01b0`. The `find('1')` method then searches for the first occurrence of '1' in this reversed string. The first '1' appears at index 1, so `find('1')` returns 1. Finally, we add 1 to this result, giving us 2.

Since the result of the print statement does not affect the values of `N`, `n`, or `j`, the output state reflects the values of these variables as they were initially defined, along with the computed return value from the print statement.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the function returns 2**
