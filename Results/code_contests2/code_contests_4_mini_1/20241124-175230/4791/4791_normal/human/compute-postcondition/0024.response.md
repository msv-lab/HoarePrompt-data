According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` must be adjusted to 1. The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted since it is already greater than 0, which allows for further iterations.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
