According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `n` is at least 1, which it is since `n` is between 1 and 499. The variable `j` will be initialized at 0 and will iterate up to `n-1`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:

- `n` is already in the range that allows the loop to execute.
- `j` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to be executed correctly, the states remain as they are, but we emphasize that `j` starts at 0.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is between 1 and 499, `j` is 0**
