The code prints the value of `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. First, we calculate `j + 1`, where `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2. The binary representation of 2 is `10`. Reversing this gives `01`, and finding the index of the first occurrence of '1' results in 0. Adding 1 to this gives us 1. Since the print statement does not affect the variable states, we maintain the initial states of `n` and `j`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the printed value is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the printed value is 1**
