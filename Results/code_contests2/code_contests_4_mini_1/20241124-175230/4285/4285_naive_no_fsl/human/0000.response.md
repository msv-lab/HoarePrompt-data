Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem as described. The task requires generating the n-th even-length palindrome number, but the function `func_1` instead attempts to check if a given input (which is expected to be an integer) is a palindrome by filtering out alphabetical characters, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

For example, if we input `1`, the program does not return `11` as required; rather, it will not function correctly since it expects a string input to check for palindromes. Therefore, there are multiple cases (such as any integer input) that will not produce the correct output, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
