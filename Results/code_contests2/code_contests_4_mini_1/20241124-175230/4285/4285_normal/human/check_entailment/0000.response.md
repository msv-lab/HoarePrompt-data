The program provided does not follow the problem description. The problem requires a function that computes the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, while the actual code provided takes a string input, processes it to retain only alphabetic characters, and checks if that string is a palindrome. This functionality does not relate to finding even-length palindromes in integers, as described in the problem statement.

Furthermore, the output hints describe a string processing function that simply checks for palindromic properties, which has no relevance to the concept of even-length palindromic numbers in the context provided by the problem description.

For example, if we input `1`, the expected output according to the problem description should be `11`, which is the first even-length palindrome number. However, the code does not even handle numerical input correctly and does not calculate any palindrome numbers at all.

Thus, the code fails to meet the requirements of the problem description and does not handle any relevant cases for the task.

Correctness: **False**.
