The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be a string, not a positive integer as suggested by the annotations. The function processes `n` by converting all alphabetic characters to lowercase and concatenating them into a new string `x`. It then checks if this string `x` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`x[::-1]`). 

However, the annotations state that the function returns `True` for an empty string being a palindrome, which is correct, but it fails to mention that the function will also return `True` for any string that is a palindrome and `False` otherwise. Additionally, if `n` contains no alphabetic characters, `x` will be an empty string, which is also a palindrome.

The potential edge cases include:
- Input strings that are entirely non-alphabetic (resulting in an empty string).
- Mixed-case strings that are palindromes when normalized to lowercase.
- Strings that are not palindromes.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `n`, processes it to retain only alphabetic characters in lowercase, and returns `True` if the resulting string is a palindrome, or `False` if it is not. If `n` contains no alphabetic characters, it returns `True` since an empty string is a palindrome. **
