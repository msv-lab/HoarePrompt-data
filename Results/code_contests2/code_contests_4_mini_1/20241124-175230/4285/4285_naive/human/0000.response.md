Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The task is to generate the n-th even-length palindrome number, but the program instead attempts to check if a given string is a palindrome by filtering out alphabetic characters. 

For example, if `n = 1`, the expected output is `11`, but the function `func_1` does not compute or return the n-th even-length palindrome number at all. Instead, it processes input in a way that is unrelated to the problem description.

Since the program does not handle the specified task, it is incorrect.
