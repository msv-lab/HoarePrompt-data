Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not correspond to the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` is checking if a string `n` is a palindrome, but it does not compute the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, which is what the problem asks for.

For example, if the input is `1`, the expected output is `11` (the first even-length palindrome), but the program will not produce this output because it is not designed to generate even-length palindromes.

Additionally, the logic inside the function is unrelated to the generation of even-length palindromes, and the comment provided in the annotation is misleading. The program does not handle the requirements specified in the problem description at all.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case outlined in the problem statement. For this reason, the correctness is marked false.
