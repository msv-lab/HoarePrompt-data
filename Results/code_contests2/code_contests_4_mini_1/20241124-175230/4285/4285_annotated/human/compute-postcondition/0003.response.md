The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be a string. It processes this string by removing all non-alphabetic characters and converting the remaining characters to lowercase. The function then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards. 

The annotations mistakenly refer to `n` as a positive integer, which is incorrect. Additionally, it does not address the case where `n` might be empty or contain no alphabetic characters, which would result in an empty string being evaluated as a palindrome (and thus return `True`).

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `n`, removes non-alphabetic characters and converts it to lowercase, and returns True if the resulting string is a palindrome, or False otherwise. **
