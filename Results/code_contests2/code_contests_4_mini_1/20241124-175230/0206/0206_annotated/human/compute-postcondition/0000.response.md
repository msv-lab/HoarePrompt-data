The initial state indicates that `N` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, and `a` is a list of `N` integers, each between 0 and 1000. The line of code `N = raw_input()` takes user input and assigns it to `N`. However, since the input is taken as a string by `raw_input()` and needs to be converted to an integer, the actual value of `N` will depend on the input provided.

Since the exact input value is not specified, we cannot determine the final value of `N`. The other variable `a` remains unaffected at this point as no operations are performed on it.

Output State: **`a` is a list of N integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, and `N` is an input integer (string form until processed)**
