The variable `a` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which means it will take a string input, split it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assign that list to `a`. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of integers, but since `raw_input()` returns strings, the elements of `a` will initially be strings until they are converted to integers. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of strings (substrings from the input), and `N` remains unchanged as an input integer in string form.

Output State: **`a` is a list of strings (substrings from the input), `N` is an input integer (string form)**
