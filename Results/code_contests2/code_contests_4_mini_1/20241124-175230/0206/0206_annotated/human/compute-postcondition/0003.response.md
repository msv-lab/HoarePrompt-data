The code snippet prints the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is already computed as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`. The initial values of `a` and `N` do not affect the print statement. Therefore, the output state includes the current values of `a`, `N`, and the printed value of `ans`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of strings; `N` is an input integer (string form); `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in `a`, and the function prints `ans`.**
