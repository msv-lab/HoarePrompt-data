Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input an integer N followed by a list of N integers. It computes the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list and prints the result. However, it does not handle invalid input scenarios where the number of integers entered does not match N or where the input integers are outside the specified range. **
