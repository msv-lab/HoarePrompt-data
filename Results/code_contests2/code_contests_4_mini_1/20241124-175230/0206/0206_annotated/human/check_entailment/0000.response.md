To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the code.

**Problem Requirements:**
AtCoDeer must deliver gifts to all houses located at given coordinates. The task is to find the minimum distance he must travel, starting and ending at any position. The minimum distance to cover all houses is essentially the distance between the farthest apart houses.

**Code Analysis:**
```python
def func():
    N = raw_input()  # This reads the number of houses (not actually used in the calculation)
    a = raw_input().split()  # This reads the coordinates of the houses
    ans = np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))  # This calculates the distance between the furthest houses
    print(ans)  # This prints the result
```

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The input is read as strings from `raw_input()` and then split into a list of strings. The distances must be converted to integers before performing any calculations. Without this conversion, `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)` will not work as expected since they will be operating on string data.

2. **Importing NumPy**: 
   - The code uses `np.abs`, `np.max`, and `np.min`, suggesting that it assumes the `numpy` library is imported, but the code does not include an import statement for `numpy`. This will lead to a `NameError`.

3. **Redundant Input**: 
   - The variable `N` is captured but not used in any calculations. While this does not affect the output directly, it indicates a lack of necessary implementation.

### Example Case Where it Fails:
For input:
```
4
2 3 7 9
```
The program would fail due to the lack of type conversion for `a`. It would attempt to find the maximum and minimum values from a list of strings, leading to incorrect results or a runtime error.

### Conclusion:
Given these issues, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**
