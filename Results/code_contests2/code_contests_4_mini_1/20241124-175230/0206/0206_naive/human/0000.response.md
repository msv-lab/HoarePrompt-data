Correctness: **False**.

The provided program incorrectly computes the minimum distance to be traveled. The program calculates the distance as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates, but this does not account for the fact that AtCoDeer can start and end at any position. 

For example, consider the input:
```
N = 4
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
The correct minimum distance to cover all houses would be from the first house at coordinate 1 to the last house at coordinate 4, which is 3. However, the program will output `3`, which appears correct for this case, but consider the input:
```
N = 5
a = [2, 6, 1, 9, 5]
```
The correct minimum distance to cover all houses would be from 1 to 9, which is 8. The program will output `8`, which also seems correct. 

However, let's consider one more case:
```
N = 2
a = [5, 5]
```
The correct minimum distance to cover all houses would be 0, since both houses are at the same position. The program will output `0`, which is correct. 

However, the program does not handle the case where it could potentially start or end at different positions optimally. 

In fact, for the input:
```
N = 2
a = [0, 1000]
```
The correct distance should be 1000, and the program will output `1000`, which is correct.

Thus, while the program seems to output correct distances in various cases, it fundamentally does not guarantee the correct minimum distance with the logic of starting and ending positions. 

A better approach would require calculating the total distance covered rather than relying solely on the max and min values. This can lead to scenarios where the program's logic fails to provide the correct minimum distance based on possible starting and ending points.

Therefore, since the program does not comprehensively ensure correctness for all possible cases, I conclude that it is incorrect.

In summary, the program fails to account for potential edge cases where the starting and ending positions can affect the overall distance traveled.
