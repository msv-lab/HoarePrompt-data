The function reads an input value for N (but does not validate it), then reads a list of space-separated strings from the input, which it attempts to treat as a list of integers. It calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of this list, and prints the result. There is no validation for whether the list contains exactly N integers, nor for whether the inputs are valid integers, which could lead to runtime errors if the input does not meet these expectations.
