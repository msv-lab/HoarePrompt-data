The variable `a` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which means it will take a line of input, split it by whitespace, and create a list of strings. The initial state indicates that `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100) and that `a` is a list of `N` integers. After this operation, `a` will contain `N` string representations of the integers provided in the input.

Since `N` dictates the number of integers that should be in `a`, and the input will be taken accordingly, the values of `a` will be a list of strings converted from the input but still remain strings at this point.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `N` strings.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `N` strings.**
