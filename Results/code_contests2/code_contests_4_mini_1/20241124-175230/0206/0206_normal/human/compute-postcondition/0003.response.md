The code snippet simply prints the value of `ans`, which is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`. Since `N` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of `N` strings, the output state will reflect the values of `N`, `a`, and the result of `ans` based on the previously calculated absolute difference.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `N` strings, and `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in `a`, and the function prints `ans`.**
