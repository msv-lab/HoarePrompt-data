To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided Python code snippet. The code calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values from a list of strings `a`. However, since the strings in `a` are compared lexicographically (as they are strings), the maximum and minimum will depend on the specific strings in the list.

Assuming we do not know the specific strings in `a`, we can only state the effect of the code on the `ans` variable. 

The output state would include the original conditions of `N` and `a`, as well as the calculated value for `ans`, which is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `N` strings, and `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in `a`.**
