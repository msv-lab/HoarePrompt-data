To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic in light of the problem description.

The problem requires calculating the minimum distance AtCoDeer has to travel to deliver gifts to all the houses located at given coordinates. Based on the problem statement, the minimum distance to be traveled when he can start and end his travel at any positions is the distance between the farthest two houses.

Now let's analyze the program:

```python
N = raw_input()
a = raw_input().split()
ans = np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))
print(ans)
```

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - It reads `N` (the number of houses) and a list of coordinates `a`.
   - The coordinates are read as strings and split into a list.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum and minimum of the coordinates using `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)`.
   - It computes the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values to determine the distance.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Data Type Handling**: The values in `a` are read as strings and not converted to integers. This will cause the functions `np.max()` and `np.min()` to not work as intended because they will compare strings lexicographically rather than numerically.

  For instance, if you input:
  ```
  4
  2 3 7 9
  ```
  The values in `a` will be `['2', '3', '7', '9']`. Consequently, `np.max(a)` will return `'9'` and `np.min(a)` will return `'2'`, leading to a result of `abs('9' - '2')` which will raise an error because you cannot subtract strings.

Thus, the program fails to handle the input correctly due to the type mismatch.

### Conclusion:

Since the program does not correctly compute the distance due to the issue with string handling, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False** 

### Example of Failure:
For an input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
The program will fail to calculate the distance correctly since it treats the inputs as strings. The expected output should be `3`, but it will raise an error when trying to compute `np.max()` and `np.min()` on string types.
