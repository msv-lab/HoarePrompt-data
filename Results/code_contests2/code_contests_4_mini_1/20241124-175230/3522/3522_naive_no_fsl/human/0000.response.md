To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the program and its handling of various cases.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of queries (`q`) and then processes each query by reading an integer `a`.
2. **Odd Check**: If `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from `a` and increments the counter `c` by 1.
3. **Edge Case Check**: The program checks if the modified `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), which are the numbers that cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers.
4. **Output Calculation**:
   - If `a` is one of the numbers in the set, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the result as `a / 4 + c`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program subtracts 9 from odd numbers but does not handle cases where the resulting number is still less than 4 (the smallest composite number).
- The program checks for the specific set of numbers that cannot form composite sums without considering if there are other possibilities that could arise after modifying `a` (for example, when `a` is large and odd).
- The output of `a / 4` uses integer division (in Python 2), which could lead to incorrect results if not properly handled.

### Test Case Considerations:
Let's consider a few test cases:
1. **Case with `n = 9` (odd)**: 
   - The program would subtract 9, resulting in `a = 0`, which is not handled and could lead to incorrect behavior.
2. **Case with `n = 10` (even)**: 
   - For `n = 10`, the output should be `2` since `10 = 4 + 6`, which are both composite numbers.
3. **Case with `n = 15` (odd)**:
   - The program would subtract 9, resulting in `a = 6`, which should output `1` since `6 = 6` is a valid composite summand.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases as described. Specifically, it fails for inputs like `9` and potentially other odd numbers greater than or equal to `9`. 

Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the result of subtracting 9 leads to values that are less than 4, which cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers.
