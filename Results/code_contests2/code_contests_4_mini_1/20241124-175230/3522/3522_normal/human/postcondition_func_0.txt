The function accepts an integer representing the number of queries and processes each query with a positive integer. It outputs -1 for certain small integers, and for others, it computes and returns `a / 4 + c`, where `c` is set based on whether `a` was odd. Edge cases include potential errors for invalid input and handling of values less than 9 when odd.
