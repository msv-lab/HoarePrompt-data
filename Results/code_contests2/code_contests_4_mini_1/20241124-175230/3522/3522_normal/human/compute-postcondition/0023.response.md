Output State: **`q` is the total number of queries processed. For each query, if `ni` is an odd integer, `c` is 1 and `a` becomes `ni - 9`; if `ni` is even, `c` remains 0. The output will be -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11); otherwise, it will be `a / 4 + c`. If there are no queries (i.e., `q` is 0), the loop does not execute, and all variables remain in their initial states. If `ni` is not an integer, the loop will raise an error when trying to assign `a` from input.**
