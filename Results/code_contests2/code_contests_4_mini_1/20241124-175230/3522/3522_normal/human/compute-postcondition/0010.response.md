The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `c` was `0`, so it remains unchanged. The other variables (`q`, `ni`, and `a`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is 1, `ni` is 2, `c` is 0, and `a` is an input string.

Output State: **`q` is 1, `ni` is 2, `c` is 0, and `a` is an input string**
