The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`, which means it is explicitly set to `0`. The values of the other variables (`q`, `ni`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `c` while retaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`q` is 2, `ni` is 2, `c` is 0, `a` is an input string**
