The value of `a` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input. The previous values of the affected variables `q`, `ni`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is 1, `ni` is 2, `c` is 0, and `a` is an input string.

Output State: **`q` is 1, `ni` is 2, `c` is 0, and `a` is an input string**
