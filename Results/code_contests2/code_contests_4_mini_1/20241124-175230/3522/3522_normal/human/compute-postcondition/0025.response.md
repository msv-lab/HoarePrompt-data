The function `func` accepts an integer input that represents the number of queries to process. For each query, it expects a positive integer `a`. The function checks if `a` is odd; if so, it subtracts 9 from `a` and sets a counter `c` to 1. The function then evaluates the modified or unmodified `a`: if `a` is one of the specific small integers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the result of `a / 4` plus the value of `c`. 

Key edge cases include:
- If `a` is odd and less than 9, subtracting 9 will result in a negative number, which may affect the subsequent division and output.
- The function does not handle cases where the input for `a` is invalid (e.g., not an integer), which would raise an error.
- The output for even numbers and certain odd numbers is calculated differently based on their values.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer representing the number of queries and processes each query with a positive integer. It outputs -1 for certain small integers, and for others, it computes and returns `a / 4 + c`, where `c` is set based on whether `a` was odd. Edge cases include potential errors for invalid input and handling of values less than 9 when odd. **
