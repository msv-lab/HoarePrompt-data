According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`, which indicates the number of queries. For the loop to execute, `q` must be at least 1. Additionally, since each query `ni` is a positive integer, we need to ensure that there is at least one `ni` value to process. 

At the start of the loop, we can set `q` to its minimum value of 1, and since `ni` is not provided in the initial state, we can assume it will be the first positive integer, which is 1.

State: **`q` is 1, `ni` is 1**
