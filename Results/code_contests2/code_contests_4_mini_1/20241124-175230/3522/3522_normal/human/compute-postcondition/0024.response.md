The function `func` accepts a parameter `q`, which is a positive integer representing the number of queries. For each query, there is a parameter `ni`, which is also a positive integer. The function processes these queries and returns results based on the values of `ni`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a positive integer `q` representing the number of queries, where each query is associated with a positive integer `ni`, and return results pertaining to those queries.
