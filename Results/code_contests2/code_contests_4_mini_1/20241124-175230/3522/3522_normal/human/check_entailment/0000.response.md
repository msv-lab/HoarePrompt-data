Let's analyze the provided program in light of the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to represent a given integer \( n_i \) as a sum of the maximum number of composite numbers. If it's not possible to do so, the output should be -1. Notably, composite numbers are integers greater than 1 that are not prime.

### Program Analysis:
```python
for _ in xrange(input()):
    a = input()
    c = 0
    if a % 2 != 0:
        a = a - 9
        c = 1
    print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads multiple queries.
2. **Odd Handling**: If the number \( a \) is odd, it reduces \( a \) by 9 and increments \( c \) by 1. This is an attempt to make \( a \) even since even composite numbers can be formed by summing 4s.
3. **Checking Validity**: After possibly modifying \( a \), it checks if \( a \) is one of the small numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If so, it returns -1 because these cannot be represented as sums of composites.
4. **Calculating Summands**: If \( a \) is valid, it returns \( \frac{a}{4} + c \), which is the maximum number of composite summands.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
- The program does not handle cases where \( a < 9 \) correctly when it is odd (it subtracts 9). All values below 9 should return -1 since they can't be represented as composite sums.
- The number 9 itself is not handled correctly; it should return -1 but does not because \( 9 - 9 = 0 \) and \( 0 \) is not in the list of small numbers.
- The number 10 returns 2 (as \( 10/4 + 0 = 2.5 \)), which is not correctly handled since we need integer outputs, and we should avoid floating point division by using integer division (i.e., `//`).

### Output Hints Analysis:
- The output hints indicate that the function outputs -1 for certain small integers and computes values based on \( a/4 + c \). However, they don't mention edge cases like 9, where the program will incorrectly calculate a value instead of returning -1.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically:
- It incorrectly handles the case for \( n = 9 \).
- It does not correctly manage integer division for the number of summands.

Given these observations, the output does not align with the problem requirements in all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
