To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code.

**Problem Description Recap:**
1. We need to represent a given integer \( n_i \) (from queries) as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands.
2. If \( n_i \) cannot be represented in such a way, we should return -1.
3. We know that composite numbers are numbers greater than 1 that are not prime, and examples include 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, etc.

**Provided Program:**
```python
for _ in xrange(input()):
    a = input()
    c = 0
    if a % 2 != 0:
        a = a - 9
        c = 1
    print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

**Analysis of the Code:**
1. The loop runs for the number of queries.
2. For each \( n_i \):
   - If \( n_i \) is odd, it reduces \( n_i \) by 9 and increments the counter \( c \) by 1.
   - Then it checks if the adjusted \( a \) is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it prints -1, indicating that it cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers.
   - If not, it divides \( a \) by 4 and adds \( c \).

**Potential Issues:**
- If \( n_i \) is even and less than 4, such as 2, it will not return -1 because the code does not check for even numbers less than 4 explicitly. Instead, it will print 0 (since \( 2 / 4 = 0 \)).
- If \( n_i \) is 1, 2, or 3, it correctly returns -1. However, 4, which is composite, should yield 1 (as it can be expressed as 4 = 4), but the code would return 0.
- For \( n_i = 6 \), the expected result is 1 (6 = 6), but the code would return 1 as well due to the logic after checking if \( a \) is in the exclusion list.
- For \( n_i = 8 \), it should return 2 (8 = 4 + 4), but the code's output will be 2, which is correct.
- The check for "not composite" numbers is incomplete since it only checks a limited set when \( a \) is adjusted.

**Conclusion:**
The program fails to correctly handle even numbers less than 4 and can return incorrect results for certain inputs based on the logic implemented.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Example of Failure:**
For \( n_i = 4 \), the expected output is 1, but the program will output 0.
