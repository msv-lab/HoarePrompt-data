To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic and how it handles the input according to the requirements.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads a number of queries `q` and then processes each query to get an integer `ni`.

2. **Logic for Composite Summands**:
   - If `ni` is odd, it subtracts 9 and sets a counter `c` to 1, indicating that one composite number (which is 9) has been used.
   - It then checks if the modified `ni` (after subtraction if it was odd) is in the set of numbers `{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}`. If it is, the output is `-1`, indicating that it cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers.
   - If not, the program calculates the maximum possible number of composite summands as `a / 4 + c`, where `a` is the possibly modified `ni`. Division by 4 is used because the smallest composite number is 4, and thus the maximum number of summands can be calculated by how many 4s can fit into `a`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program then prints the result for each query.

### Edge Cases and Incorrect Logic

- The program fails to handle cases correctly for certain values of `ni`:
  - If `ni = 6`, the program logic will subtract 9 (making `ni` negative), and then check if -3 is in `{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}` which it isn't and thus will incorrectly return `0` (since `-3 // 4 + 1` is `0`). However, `6` can be expressed as `4 + 4`, thus the correct answer should be `1`.
  
- Similarly, for `ni = 10`, the program will treat it as `10` (even) and will check if `10` is in `{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}` (it isn't), thus it will compute `10 / 4 + 0 = 2`, which is correct, but it is wrong since `10` can be expressed as `4 + 6` or `6 + 4`, which are not purely composite summands.

- The program also does not handle larger values correctly. For example, `ni = 14` would yield `14 / 4 + 0 = 3`, which is incorrect because it could be expressed as `4 + 10` but not maximally as composite summands.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle several input cases as demonstrated above. Therefore, it can be concluded that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
