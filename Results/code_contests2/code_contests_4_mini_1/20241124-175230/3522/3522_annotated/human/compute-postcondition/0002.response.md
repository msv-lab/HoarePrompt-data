The variable `c` is assigned the value of 0. The other variables, `q`, `a`, and `_`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `c` along with the existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100000; `a` is `q`; `_` is 0; `c` is 0**
