The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged as it is user input and not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the user input (which could be any value), `c` is now 0.

Output State: **`a` is the user input (which could be any value), `c` is now 0**
