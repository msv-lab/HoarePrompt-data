To determine the output state, we analyze the initial conditions and the provided code snippet.

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `a` is the user input (value can vary).
   - `c` is initialized to 0.

2. **Code Behavior**:
   - If `a` is odd, then:
     - `a` is updated to `a - 9`.
     - `c` is set to 1.
   - If `a` is even, then:
     - `a` remains unchanged.
     - `c` remains 0.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement evaluates:
     - If `a` is in the set `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`, it prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it computes and prints `a / 4 + c`.

Given that `a` can take various values, we must consider the potential outcomes based on whether `a` is odd or even, and whether it falls within the specified set for the print condition.

### Case Analysis:
- **Case 1**: If `a` is odd and in `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`:
  - `a` gets updated to `a - 9` (and could be negative).
  - `c` becomes 1.
  - The print statement will then check if the new value of `a` (after subtraction) is in the set, which it will not be (assuming `a` > 9), so it will compute `a / 4 + 1`.

- **Case 2**: If `a` is odd but not in `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`:
  - Similar to Case 1, `a` gets updated and `c` becomes 1. The print statement will calculate `a / 4 + 1`.

- **Case 3**: If `a` is even:
  - `a` remains unchanged and `c` stays 0. If `a` is in the set, it prints `-1`, otherwise, it computes `a / 4`.

### Conclusion:
Since we don't have a specific input value for `a`, the output state will reflect the conditions based on the user input, leading to different outputs based on whether `a` is odd/even and whether it is in the specified set.

Output State: **`a` is the user input; `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the odd/even nature of `a`; the print statement results in either -1 or a computation of `a / 4 + c`.**
