The value of `c` is assigned the value `1`, and the previous value of `c` was `0`. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the value returned by input() minus 9; `c` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is the value returned by input() minus 9; `c` is 1**
