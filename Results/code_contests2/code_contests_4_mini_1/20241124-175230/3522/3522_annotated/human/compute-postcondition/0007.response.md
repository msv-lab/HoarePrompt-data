To determine the output state, we need to consider the values of `q` and how they affect `a` and `c` based on whether `a` is odd or even.

1. **Determining if `a` is odd or even:**
   - Since `a` is equal to `q`, we first check the parity of `q`.
   - If `q` is odd, then `a` is updated to `q - 9` and `c` is set to 1.
   - If `q` is even, then `a` remains unchanged, and `c` remains 0.

2. **Print statement evaluation:**
   - The print statement checks if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).
   - If it is, it prints `-1`.
   - If it is not, it prints the result of the expression `a / 4 + c`.

Since the exact value of `q` is not provided, we will consider the possible scenarios based on whether `q` is odd or even.

- If `q` is odd (and thus `a` = `q` is odd):
  - `a` = `q - 9` (where `q` is odd) and `c` = 1.
  - We need to check if `a` = `q - 9` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) to determine what gets printed.
  
- If `q` is even (and thus `a` = `q` is even):
  - `a` = `q` and `c` = 0.
  - We check if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).

In both cases, without knowing the exact value of `q`, we can't determine the final output specifically, but we can state the conditions that would lead to different outputs.

Output State: **`a` is either `q - 9` (if `q` is odd) or `q` (if `q` is even); `c` is either 1 (if `q` is odd) or 0 (if `q` is even); output depends on whether `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).**
