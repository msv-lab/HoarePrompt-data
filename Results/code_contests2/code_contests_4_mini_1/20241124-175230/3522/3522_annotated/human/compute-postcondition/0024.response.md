The function `func` accepts a parameter `q`, which is a positive integer constrained by \(1 \leq q \leq 10^5\). Additionally, for each query `ni`, `ni` is a positive integer constrained by \(1 \leq ni \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, the specific outputs based on these inputs are not detailed, but the function processes the queries based on the provided constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `q` and a series of positive integers `ni`, performing operations based on these inputs within the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) and a series of positive integers ni (1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9).**
