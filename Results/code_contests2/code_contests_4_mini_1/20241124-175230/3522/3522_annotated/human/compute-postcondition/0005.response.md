The value of `c` is assigned 1, which changes its previous value of 0 to 1. The other variables `q`, `a`, and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100000; `a` is an even integer (`q - 9`); `_` is 0; `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100000; `a` is an even integer (`q - 9`); `_` is 0; `c` is 1**
