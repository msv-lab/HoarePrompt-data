The function `func` reads input values for n, V, ai, and bi, processes them according to the specified constraints, and then calculates and prints a result. The function uses a series of mathematical operations involving the provided values to determine an output. However, without a clear explanation or context for the constraints and calculations, the exact purpose or meaning of the output is not defined in the given information. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly in its definition.
