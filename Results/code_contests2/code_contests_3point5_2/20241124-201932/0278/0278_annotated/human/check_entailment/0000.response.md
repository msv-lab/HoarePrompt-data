Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided code and the problem description, it seems that the program is correctly calculating the volume of borscht that Volodya will cook ultimately based on the given ingredients and proportions. The code takes the input values, performs the necessary calculations, and outputs the volume of soup that can be cooked.

The code handles the input constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 20, 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100, 0 ≤ bi ≤ 100) and follows the logic described in the problem statement to determine the volume of soup accurately. The use of lambda functions and reduce function might make the code a bit hard to read, but the overall logic appears to be correct.

Since there are no specific cases mentioned where the program fails to provide the correct output, we can conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases based on the provided problem description.
