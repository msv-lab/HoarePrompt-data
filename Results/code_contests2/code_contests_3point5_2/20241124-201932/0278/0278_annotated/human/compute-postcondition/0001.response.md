Example Answer: 
The lists `a` and `b` are created by converting the input strings into lists of floats. The values of `a` and `b` are dependent on the input values provided. `a` contains n float values and `b` contains n float values. The values of n, ai, and bi are not explicitly mentioned in the code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `V` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000. `ai` and `bi` are lists of n integers where 1 <= ai[i] <= 100 and 0 <= bi[i] <= 100.
Output State: **`n` and `V` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000. `ai` and `bi` are lists of n integers where 1 <= ai[i] <= 100 and 0 <= bi[i] <= 100**
