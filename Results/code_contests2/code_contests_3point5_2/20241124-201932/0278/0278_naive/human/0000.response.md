Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
This program correctly takes the input values, calculates the volume of soup that Volodya will cook, and outputs the result with a relative or absolute error less than 10^-4. The program uses reduce and zip functions along with lambda expressions to perform the necessary calculations. It iterates through the ingredients and their corresponding amounts to determine the minimum factor by which all ingredients can be multiplied to fit within the volume constraint. Then it calculates the total volume of soup that can be cooked based on this factor. The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
