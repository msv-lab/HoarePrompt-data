Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input values for the number of ingredients, the volume of the pan, the proportions of the ingredients, and the available amounts of each ingredient. It then calculates the maximum volume of soup that can be cooked by iteratively reducing the available amounts of each ingredient based on the proportions until either the pan volume is reached or the ingredients run out.

The program uses lambda functions and list comprehensions to perform the calculations efficiently. The use of `reduce` and `zip` helps in iterating over the ingredients and their proportions simultaneously.

Overall, the program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and provides the expected output for the given examples.
