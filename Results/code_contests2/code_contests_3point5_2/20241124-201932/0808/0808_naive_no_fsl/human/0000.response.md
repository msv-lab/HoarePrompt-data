Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads an integer n and uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers up to n. It then prints the count of prime numbers less than or equal to n. The program iterates through all possible datasets (n values) and outputs the correct number of prime numbers for each dataset. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
