Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program does not read an integer n and print the number of prime numbers less than or equal to n. Instead, it seems to be using a sieve algorithm to mark non-prime numbers in a list `a`. The output logic is also not correctly implemented.

An example of a case where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
10

Expected Output:
4

Actual Output:
0

The program does not handle the prime number calculation as required by the problem description.
