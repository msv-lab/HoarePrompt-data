According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the range specified by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`. The loop will execute as long as the range specified has at least one element. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the range specified by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)` has at least one element. Since `i` is given as 3, we need to calculate the range and adjust the states accordingly.

Calculating the range:
`i ** 2 - 1` = 3 ** 2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8
So, the range will start from 8 and increment by 3 until it reaches or exceeds 1000000.

Adjusting the states:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999.
- `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with certain elements set to False.
- `j` represents the last element set to False.
- `i` is 3.
- The range specified by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)` needs to be such that it has at least one element.
- Based on the calculated range, adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with certain elements set to False, `j` represents the last element set to False, `i` is 3, the range specified by `range(8, 1000000, 3)` has at least one element**
