Output State: **If i is less than 2 or greater than the square root of 1000000, the loop does not execute. If the loop executes, 'n' is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; 'a' is a list of 1000000 elements, where the elements at indices that are multiples of i starting from i^2 - 1 are set to False; 'i' is 2, 'j' is the index of the last element that was set to False**
