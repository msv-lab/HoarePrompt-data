Postcondition: ***'n' is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, 'a' is a list of 1000000 elements with certain elements set to False, 'j' represents the last element set to False, 'i' is 3. If n is at least 9, the loop will execute at least once and update the elements in 'a' based on the specified range. If n is less than 9, the loop will not execute.***
