According to the code, the loop can execute if the range specified by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)` is valid. In this case, the loop will execute if `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000. So, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000. Additionally, since j is the index of the last element that was set to False, we need to update j to the starting value of the range specified.
State: **'n' is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; 'a' is a list of 1000000 elements, 'i' is 1000000, 'j' is `i ** 2 - 1` and `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000**
