The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The value of `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to return the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n`. 
Functionality: **The function returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999.**
