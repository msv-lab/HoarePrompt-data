According to the code, the loop can execute as long as 'i' is less than or equal to the square root of 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, 'i' is 999999 which is greater than the square root of 1000000. Therefore, 'i' needs to be adjusted to 1000000 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **'n' is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; 'a' is a list of 1000000 elements, 'i' is 1000000, 'j' is the index of the last element that was set to False.**
