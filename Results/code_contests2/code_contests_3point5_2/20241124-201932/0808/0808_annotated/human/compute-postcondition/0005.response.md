According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the range specified. If the range allows for another iteration and `i` allows for it, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 elements, where the element at index 3 is `False`; `i` is 2, `j` is 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be within the range specified in the loop statement. 
Since `j` is currently 3 and the loop iterates from `i ** 2 - 1` to 1000000 with a step of `i`, the next value of `j` should be `i ** 2 - 1 + i`, which is 4 in this case.

No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 elements, where the element at index 3 is `False`; `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
