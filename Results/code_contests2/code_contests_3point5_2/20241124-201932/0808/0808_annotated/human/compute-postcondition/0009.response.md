According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than 1000000, so `j` needs to be adjusted to less than 1000000. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 elements, where the element at index 3 is `False`, and the element at index 5 is `False`; `i` is 2, `j` is less than 1000000**
