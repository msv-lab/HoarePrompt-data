According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute if the range specified in the for loop is valid. In this case, the loop will execute if `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000. Before the loop starts, `i` is 2, so `i ** 2 - 1` will be 3 which is less than 1000000, ensuring the loop will execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are: `j` is 3.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 elements, all of which are `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
