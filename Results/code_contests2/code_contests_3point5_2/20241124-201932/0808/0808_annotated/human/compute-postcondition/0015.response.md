According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables 'i' and 'j'. If 'j' is less than 'i ** 2 - 1', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, 'i' is 1000000, 'j' is 1000000. So for the loop to be executed one more time, 'j' needs to be less than '1000000' and 'i' needs to remain the same.
State: **'n' is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; 'a' is a list of 1000000 elements with the value at index 1000000 set to False, 'i' is 1000000, 'j' is 999999**
