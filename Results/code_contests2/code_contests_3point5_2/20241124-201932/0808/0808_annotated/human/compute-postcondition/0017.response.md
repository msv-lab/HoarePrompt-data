According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables 'i' and 'j'. If 'j' is less than 'i ** 2 - 1', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, 'i' is 1000000, 'j' is 999999. For the loop to execute one more time, 'j' should be less than 'i ** 2 - 1'. So, 'j' needs to be adjusted to 999998.
State: **'n' is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; 'a' is a list of 1000000 elements with the value at index 1000000 set to False, 'i' is 1000000, 'j' is 999998, and the value at index 999999 in list 'a' is set to False**
