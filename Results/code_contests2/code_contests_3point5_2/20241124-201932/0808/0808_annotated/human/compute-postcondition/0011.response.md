Postcondition: ***'n' is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; 'a' is a list of 1000000 elements. If i is less than 2 or greater than the square root of 1000000, no elements in the list are changed. If the loop executes, the elements at indices that are multiples of i starting from i^2 - 1 are set to False. 'i' remains 2 and 'j' is the index of the last element that was set to False.***
