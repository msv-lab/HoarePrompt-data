According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the range specified includes at least one valid value. In this case, the loop will execute if `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `j` is equal to `i ** 2 - 1` and `j` is less than 1000000.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; list `a` is initialized with 1000000 `True` values, `i` is 2, the value at index `i - 1` in list `a` is True, `j` is equal to `i ** 2 - 1` and `j` is less than 1000000**
