Output State: **If `i` is less than 2, the loop won't execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `n` remains an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is initialized with 1000000 `True` values, `i` is 3, `j` is less than 1000000, and `a[j]` is now `False` for values of `j` that satisfy the loop condition.**
