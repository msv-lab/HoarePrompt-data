Example Answer:
The list `a` is initialized with a list of 1000000 `True` values. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; list `a` is initialized with 1000000 `True` values.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; list `a` is initialized with 1000000 `True` values**
