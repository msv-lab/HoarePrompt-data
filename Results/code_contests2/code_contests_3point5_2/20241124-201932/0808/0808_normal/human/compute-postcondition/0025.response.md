According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to or greater than `i`, `a[j]` is now `False`. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than 1000000. Since `j` is now equal to or greater than `i`, it can be adjusted to `j` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is initialized with 1000000 `True` values, `i` is 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 4, `a[j]` is now `False`**
