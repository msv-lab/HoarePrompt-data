Output State: **If n is a multiple of 3, the loop will execute until the list a is filled with False values at every 3rd index starting from i^2 - 1. If n is not a multiple of 3, the loop will not execute and a will remain as a list filled with True values except for the initial 3 False values at the beginning.**
