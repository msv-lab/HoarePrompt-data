Since the loop executes for prime values of `i`, we need to find the next prime number after 2 to determine if the loop will execute one more time. The next prime number after 2 is 3. Therefore, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is updated to 3.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; list `a` is initialized with 1000000 `True` values, `i` is 3**
