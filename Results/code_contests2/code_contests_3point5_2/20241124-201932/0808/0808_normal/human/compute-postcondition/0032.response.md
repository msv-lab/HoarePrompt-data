According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is initialized with 1000000 `True` values, `i` is 3. Since the loop can execute again, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is initialized with 1000000 `True` values, `i` is 4**
