According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is initialized with 1000000 `True` values, `i` is 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 4, `a[j]` is now `False`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `j` needs to be less than 1000000. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is initialized with 1000000 `True` values, `i` is 3, `j` is less than 1000000, `a[j]` is now `False`**
