Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; list `a` is initialized with 1000000 `True` values, `i` is 2. If the value at index `i - 1` in list `a` is True, the loop updates elements in list `a` to False at specific indices determined by the value of `i`. The loop executes for prime values of `i` and does not execute for non-prime values of `i`. After the loop execution, the values in list `a` are updated based on the primality of `i`, covering all edge cases where the loop may or may not run based on the nature of `i`.***
