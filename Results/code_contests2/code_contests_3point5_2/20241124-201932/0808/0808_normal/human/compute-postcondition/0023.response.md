According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as the range provided by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)` is not empty. In order for the loop to execute, the range must have at least one value.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is initialized with 1000000 `True` values, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to or greater than `i ** 2 - 1` and `j` is less than 1000000**
