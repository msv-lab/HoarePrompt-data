Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting to composite summands for all inputs. 

For example, if the input is 15, the program will output 1, but the correct output should be 4 (15 = 9 + 6). This shows that the program does not handle all cases as described in the problem description.
