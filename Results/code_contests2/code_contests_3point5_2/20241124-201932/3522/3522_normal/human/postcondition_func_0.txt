The function `func` reads user input, processes it based on certain conditions, and prints the calculated results. If the input is odd, it subtracts 9 from it and sets a flag `c` to 1. If the input is even, no changes are made. Then, it prints -1 if the input is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11); otherwise, it prints the input divided by 4 plus `c`. The function does not accept any parameters.
