Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: q is a positive integer. Each ni is a positive integer; `a` is the input value.
Output State: **Precondition: q is a positive integer. Each ni is a positive integer; `a` is the input value**
