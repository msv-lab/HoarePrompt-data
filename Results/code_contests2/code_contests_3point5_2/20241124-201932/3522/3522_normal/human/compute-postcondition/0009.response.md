Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the user input, which could be any value. Since `a` was initially stated as an odd number, it is now assigned the value of the user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is 1, `a` is the user input value.
Output State: **`c` is 1, `a` is the user input value**
