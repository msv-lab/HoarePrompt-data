Example Answer:
The value of `a` is decremented by 9. The initial value of `a` is the user input value of the next iteration. Therefore, the new value of `a` will be the user input value of the next iteration minus 9. The value of `c` remains 0. 
Output State: **`c` is 0, `a` is the user input value of the next iteration minus 9**
