Example Answer:
If `a` is an odd number, `a` is decreased by 9, and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is an even number, `c` remains 0. The condition checks if `a` is in the list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If true, it prints -1, otherwise, it prints `a` divided by 4 plus `c`. The output state is based on the calculation of the print statement with the given initial state values.
Output State: **`c` is 0 or 1, `a` is an integer. If `a` is an odd number, it is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is an even number, `c` remains 0. The output is either -1 or the result of `a` divided by 4 plus `c` based on the conditions described.**
