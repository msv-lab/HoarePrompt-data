According to the code, the loop can execute based on the user input value. If the input value is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is either 0 or 1, and `a` is the user input value. If `a` was an odd number, it was reduced by 9 and `c` was set to 1. If `a` was an even number, no changes were made to `a` or `c`. The result is printed as -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise, the result is `a` divided by 4 plus `c`.

To adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:
1. If the input value `a` was an odd number, it was reduced by 9 and `c` was set to 1. Therefore, if `a` was odd in the previous iteration, it needs to be adjusted accordingly for the next iteration.
2. If the input value `a` was an even number, no changes were made to `a` or `c`. Therefore, if `a` was even in the previous iteration, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`c` is 0 or 1, `a` is the user input value of the next iteration**
