According to the code, the loop can execute based on the result of `input()`, which should return a non-negative integer. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, the precondition `q` should be a positive integer, and each `ni` should be a positive integer. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `q` is a positive integer, and each `ni` is a positive integer.
State: **Precondition: q is a positive integer. Each ni is a positive integer.**
