According to the code, the loop will execute based on the input value. At the end of the previous iteration, if `a` is odd, it is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is even, `c` remains 0 and `a` retains its original value. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `a` is odd, it should be decreased by 9.
2. If `a` is 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11, then -1 should be printed.
3. If `a` is even, `c` should remain 0 and `a` should retain its original value.

State: **If `a` is odd, `a` is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11, then -1 is printed. If `a` is even, `c` remains 0 and `a` retains its original value.**
