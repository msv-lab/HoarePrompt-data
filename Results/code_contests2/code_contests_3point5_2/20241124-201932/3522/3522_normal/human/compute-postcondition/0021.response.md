Example Answer:
If the user input value `a` is odd, it is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is even, `c` remains 0 and `a` retains its original value. The output is calculated based on these conditions.
Output State: **If `a` is odd, `a` is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is even, `c` remains 0 and `a` retains its original value.**
