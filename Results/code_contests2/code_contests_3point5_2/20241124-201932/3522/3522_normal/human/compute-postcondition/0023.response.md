Output State: **If the loop executes, `c` can be either 0 or 1, `a` is the user input value. If `a` is odd, it is reduced by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, no changes are made to `a` or `c`. The result is printed as -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise, the result is `a` divided by 4 plus `c`. If the loop does not execute, `c` remains 0, and `a` retains its original value.**
