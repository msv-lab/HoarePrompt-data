Output State: **`c` is 0 or 1, `a` is the user input value. If `a` is an odd number, `a` is reduced by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is an even number, no changes are made to `a` or `c`. The result is printed as -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise, the result is `a` divided by 4 plus `c`.**
