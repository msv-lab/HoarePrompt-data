Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description. It reads user input, processes it based on certain conditions, and prints the calculated results. If the input is odd, it subtracts 9 from it and sets a flag `c` to 1. If the input is even, no changes are made. Then, it prints -1 if the input is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11); otherwise, it prints the input divided by 4 plus `c`. The code handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each. The output hints also align with the code logic and confirm that the code is correct for all potential cases.
