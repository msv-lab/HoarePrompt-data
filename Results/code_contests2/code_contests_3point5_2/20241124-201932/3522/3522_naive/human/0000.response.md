Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly handles the given problem description. It checks if the input number is odd, then subtracts 9 from it and increments the count by 1, as 9 is a composite number. Then it checks if the remaining number is in the list of prime numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), if so, it prints -1. Otherwise, it divides the remaining number by 4 and adds the count to get the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting to composite summands. The logic provided covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
