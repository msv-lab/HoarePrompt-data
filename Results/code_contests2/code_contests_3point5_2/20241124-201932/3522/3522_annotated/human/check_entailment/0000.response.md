Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It handles both odd and even input numbers, adjusts the input number to maximize the number of composite summands, and outputs the correct result according to the problem requirements. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description, and all provided examples are handled correctly. Thus, the program is correct.
