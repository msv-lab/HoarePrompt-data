Output State: **If q is at least 1, then after the loop executes, a is updated based on user input. If a is odd, a is decremented by 9 and c is set to 1. If a is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the program prints -1; otherwise, it prints the result of a / 4 + c. If q is less than 1, the loop does not execute and a remains as the user input, c is 0.**
