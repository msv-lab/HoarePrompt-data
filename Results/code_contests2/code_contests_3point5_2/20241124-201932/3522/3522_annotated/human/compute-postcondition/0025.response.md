Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It iterates over a range determined by user input, updating the value of 'a' based on subsequent user inputs. If 'a' is odd, it is decremented by 9 and 'c' is set to 1. If 'a' is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the function prints -1; otherwise, it prints the result of 'a' divided by 4 plus 'c'. If the initial user input for the range is less than 1, the loop does not execute and 'a' remains as the user input, while 'c' is 0.**
