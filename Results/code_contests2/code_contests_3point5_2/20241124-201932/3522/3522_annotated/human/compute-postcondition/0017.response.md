Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value `0`, and `a` is assigned the value of `input()`. The value of `a` is dependent on user input and is unknown until runtime, so the output state is: `a` is assigned the value of user input, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is assigned the value of user input, `c` is 0**
