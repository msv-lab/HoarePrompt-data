Output State: **`a` is an integer representing user input. If `a` is odd, `a` is updated by subtracting 9 and `c` is set to 1. In all other cases where `a` is even, `a` remains unchanged at the user input value and `c` stays at 0. The code prints -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints the result of `a / 4 + c**
