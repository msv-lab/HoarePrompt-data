Output State: **`a` is a string based on user input. If `a` is an odd number, then `a` is decremented by 9 and `c` is set to 1. There are no changes if `a` is an even number. The program prints -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints the result of `a` divided by 4 plus the value of `c`.**
