Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the value returned by the `input()` function, which accepts user input. The value of `a` will depend on the input provided by the user, so it can be any string value. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string based on user input.
Output State: **`a` is a string based on user input**
