Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `c` is 0, so after execution, `c` is now 1. The state of variable `a` remains the same as it is based on user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string based on user input, `c` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is a string based on user input, `c` is 1**
