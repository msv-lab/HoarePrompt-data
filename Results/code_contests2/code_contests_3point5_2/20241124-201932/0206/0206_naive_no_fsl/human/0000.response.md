Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it is missing the import statement for numpy (`import numpy as np`). This will result in a `NameError` when trying to use `np.abs` and `np.min`. 

Additionally, the program reads the input values as strings, not integers. This will cause issues when trying to find the minimum and maximum values, as they will be treated as strings instead of numbers.

Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem description and is incorrect.
