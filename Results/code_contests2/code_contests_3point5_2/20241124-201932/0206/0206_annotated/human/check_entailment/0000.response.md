Correctness: **False**

The provided code is incorrect because:
1. The code is using `raw_input()` function which is not valid in Python. It should be replaced with `input()` function.
2. The code is missing the import statement for `numpy` library which is required for using `np.abs()` function.
3. The code is trying to find the minimum distance to be traveled by finding the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to find the minimum distance between all pairs of houses.
4. The code is not storing the integer values of house coordinates as integers, they are stored as strings after splitting.
5. The code is not iterating through all pairs of house coordinates to find the minimum distance.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
