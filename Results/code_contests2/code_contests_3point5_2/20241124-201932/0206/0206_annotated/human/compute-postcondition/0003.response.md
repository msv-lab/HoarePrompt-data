Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the value of `ans`, which is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`. The initial state does not specify the values in list `a`, so the output state will be the same as the initial state, but the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a` will be displayed as the output.
Output State: **`a` is a list of N integers representing the coordinates of N houses along TopCoDeer street, `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`**
