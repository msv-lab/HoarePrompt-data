Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user for the number of houses `N` and their coordinates. It then calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates of the houses along TopCoDeer street and prints the result. The function does not return any value. However, it is missing the necessary import statement for `numpy` to use functions like `np.abs`, and it does not handle any exceptions related to invalid input or missing libraries. **
