Example Answer:
The code calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`. Let's say `a = [3, 7, 1, 9, 5]`, then the maximum value is 9 and the minimum value is 1. The absolute difference between them is 8. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of N integers representing the coordinates of N houses along TopCoDeer street, `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of N integers representing the coordinates of N houses along TopCoDeer street, `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`**
