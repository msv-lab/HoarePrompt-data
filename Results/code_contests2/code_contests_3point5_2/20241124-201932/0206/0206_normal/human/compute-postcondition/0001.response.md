Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value returned by `raw_input().split()`. Since `N` is a string representing a positive integer, the value of `a` will be a list of strings. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of strings.
Output State: **`N` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of strings**
