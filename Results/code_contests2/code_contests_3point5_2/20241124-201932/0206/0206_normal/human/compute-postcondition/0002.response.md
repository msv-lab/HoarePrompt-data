Example Answer:
The code calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a` using NumPy's `np.max()` and `np.min()` functions. The previous values of variables `N` and `a` are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of strings, and `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`.
Output State: **`N` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of strings, `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`**
