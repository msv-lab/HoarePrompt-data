Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that AtCoDeer can start and end his travel at any positions, but the code only calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the input array. This does not give the minimum distance to be traveled when AtCoDeer can start and end his travel at any positions. Additionally, the code uses the `np` module for calculating the maximum and minimum values, which is missing in the code. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
