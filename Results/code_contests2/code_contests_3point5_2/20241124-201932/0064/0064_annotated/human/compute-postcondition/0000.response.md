Example Answer:
The `map` function converts the input values into integers and stores them in the variable `c`. Since the `map` function is used, we can assume that there are multiple values given as input. The initial values of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are unknown. After the execution, the values of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 will be updated based on the input values provided.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100**.
