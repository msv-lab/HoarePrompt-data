Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`. The values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, the sum `s` will be in the range of 0 to 500. 
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100; `s` is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, where 0 <= s <= 500**
