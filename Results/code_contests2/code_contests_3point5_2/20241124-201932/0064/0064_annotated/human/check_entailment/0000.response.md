Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program calculates the sum of coins held by all players and then checks if the sum is divisible by the number of players. If the sum is not zero and is divisible by the number of players, it calculates and prints the initial bet value. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program logic aligns with the problem description as it correctly determines the initial bet value based on the final number of coins held by each player. The program covers all potential cases and correctly handles scenarios where a valid initial bet value can be determined or when it is not possible to determine such a value.
