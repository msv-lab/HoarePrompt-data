Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input of the number of coins each player has at the end of the game and calculates the total sum of coins. If the sum is 0 or not divisible evenly by 5 (the number of players), it outputs -1. Otherwise, it calculates and outputs the average number of coins each player must have had initially. 
For all possible inputs within the given constraints (0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100), the program correctly determines the initial bet value or outputs -1 if it's not possible.
