Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input, calculates the sum of the coins each player has, and then checks if the sum is divisible by the number of players. If the sum is not zero and is divisible by the number of players, it outputs the initial bet value. This logic follows the problem description accurately. Additionally, the program handles the case where there is no possible initial bet value by outputting -1. After reviewing the problem description and the code, it appears that the program covers all potential cases and works correctly.
