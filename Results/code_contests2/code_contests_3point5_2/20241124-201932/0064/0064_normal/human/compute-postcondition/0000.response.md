Example Answer: 
The values from the input are mapped to integers and stored in `c`. Since `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are integers in the range 0 to 100, after execution, `c` will contain the mapped integers of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers such that 0 <= `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` <= 100.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers such that 0 <= `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` <= 100**
