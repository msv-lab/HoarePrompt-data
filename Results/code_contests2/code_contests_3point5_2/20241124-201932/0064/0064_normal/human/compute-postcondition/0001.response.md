Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the sum of the integers in the list `c`. The values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, the sum `s` will be the sum of these integers. 
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers such that 0 <= `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` <= 100, `s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5`**
