Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description. It reads five integers from the input, calculates their sum, and prints either -1 if the sum is 0 or not divisible by 5 (number of integers), or the average of the integers if the sum is not 0 and divisible by 5. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also align with the code, confirming its correctness.
