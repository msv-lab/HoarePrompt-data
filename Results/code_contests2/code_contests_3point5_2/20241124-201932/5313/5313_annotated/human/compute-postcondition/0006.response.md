Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`, where `x` is the integer square root of `n`. The product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `n`, so the value of `x` must be such that `x * (x+1) > n`. Therefore, `answr` is calculated accordingly. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, and the product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `n`, `answr` is the result of the calculation.**
