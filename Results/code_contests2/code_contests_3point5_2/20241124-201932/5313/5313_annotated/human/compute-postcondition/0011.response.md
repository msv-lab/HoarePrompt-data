Example Answer:
The value of `answr` is converted to an integer. The value of `answr` depends on the initial values of `n` and `x`. Based on the given conditions, the value of `answr` will be either 4x, 2(2x + 1), or 4(x + 1). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, and `answr` is either 4x, 2(2x + 1), or 4(x + 1) after converting to an integer.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, and `answr` is either 4x, 2(2x + 1), or 4(x + 1) after converting to an integer**.
