Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the square root of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the square root of `n` will also be an integer. Therefore, `x` is the integer square root of `n`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`**
