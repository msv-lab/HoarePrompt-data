Example Answer: 
`answr` is assigned the value 4 * (x + 1), where x is the integer square root of n. The product of x and (x + 1) is less than or equal to n. Since x is the integer square root of n, x * (x + 1) is at most n. Therefore, the value of answr is 4 times the next integer after x. The output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, and the product of `x` and (`x` + 1) is less than or equal to `n`, and `answr` is 4 times the next integer after x.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, the product of `x` and (`x` + 1) is less than or equal to `n`, and `answr` is 4 times the next integer after x**
