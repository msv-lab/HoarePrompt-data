Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Since `x` is the integer square root of `n`, and `x squared is equal to n`, multiplying `x` by 4 gives the value 4 times the square root of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, x is the integer square root of n, and x squared is equal to n, answr is 4 times the square root of n.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, x is the integer square root of n, and x squared is equal to n, answr is 4 times the square root of n**
