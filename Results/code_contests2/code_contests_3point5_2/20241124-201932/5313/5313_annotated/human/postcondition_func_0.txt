The function `func` takes user input as a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), calculates the integer square root of `n`, and assigns a value to `answr` based on certain conditions. If the square of the square root of `n` equals `n`, `answr` is set to 4 times the square root. If the product of the square root and (square root + 1) is greater than `n`, `answr` is set to 2 times (2 times square root + 1). Otherwise, if the product is less than or equal to `n`, `answr` is set to 4 times (square root + 1). The final value of `answr` is then printed as an integer.
