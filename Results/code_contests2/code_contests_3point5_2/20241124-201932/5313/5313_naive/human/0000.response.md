Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the minimum perimeter that can be achieved based on the number of city blocks that must be enclosed by the route. It calculates the perimeter by considering different shapes that can enclose the given number of blocks and then chooses the one with the minimum perimeter. The logic implemented in the program is correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It handles cases where the number of blocks is a perfect square, not a perfect square, or falls in between two consecutive perfect squares. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all possible cases.
