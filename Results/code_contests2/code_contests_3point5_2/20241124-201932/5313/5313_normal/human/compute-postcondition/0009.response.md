Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is the square root of N but not an integer. If x * (x + 1) > N, then answr is calculated as 2 * (x + x + 1). If x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to N, then answr is calculated as 4 * (x + 1). In all cases, answr is a value greater than x and x + 1 but less than or equal to N.***
