Example Answer: 
`x` is assigned the square root of `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. The value of `x` is the square root of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is the square root of N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is the square root of N**
