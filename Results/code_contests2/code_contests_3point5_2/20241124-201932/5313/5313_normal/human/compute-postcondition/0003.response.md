Example Answer:
The value of `answr` is calculated by multiplying `x` by 4. Since `x` is the square root of `N`, and the square of `x` is equal to `N`, `answr` is equal to `4 * square root of N`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is the square root of N, and the square of x is equal to N, and the value of answr is 4 times the square root of N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is the square root of N, and the square of x is equal to N, and the value of answr is 4 times the square root of N**
