Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is the square root of N. If x^2 equals N, then answr is calculated as 4 times the square root of N. If x * (x + 1) is greater than N, answr is evaluated as 2 times (x + x + 1). If x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to N, answr is computed as 4 times (x + 1). In all scenarios, answr is a value greater than x and x + 1 but less than or equal to N.***
