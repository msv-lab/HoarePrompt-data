Example Answer: 
`answr` is assigned the value 4 * (x + 1). Since x is the square root of N but not an integer, and the product of x and (x + 1) is less than or equal to N, we can deduce that x must be a fraction. Therefore, x + 1 is a slightly larger fraction. Multiplying by 4 gives a value greater than both x and x + 1 but still less than or equal to N. Therefore, the output state is: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is the square root of N but not an integer, the product of x and (x + 1) is less than or equal to N, and answr is a value greater than x and x + 1 but less than or equal to N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is the square root of N but not an integer, the product of x and (x + 1) is less than or equal to N, and answr is a value greater than x and x + 1 but less than or equal to N**
