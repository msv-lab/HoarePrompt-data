Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value `(x + x + 1) * 2`, where `x` is the square root of `N`. The product of `x` and `(x + 1)` is greater than `N`, so the value of `answr` is `2 * (x + x + 1)`. Since `x` is not an integer, the exact value of `answr` cannot be calculated without knowing the specific value of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is the square root of N but not an integer, and the value of `answr` is `2 * (x + x + 1)`.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is the square root of N but not an integer, and the value of `answr` is `2 * (x + x + 1)`**
