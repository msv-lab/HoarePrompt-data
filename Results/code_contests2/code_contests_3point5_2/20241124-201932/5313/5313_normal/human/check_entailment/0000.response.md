Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes an integer input `n` representing the number of city blocks that must be enclosed by the route.
- It then calculates the square root of `n` and checks three conditions:
  1. If the square of the calculated square root is equal to `n`, then it assigns `answr` as `x * 4`.
  2. If the product of the calculated square root and its successor is greater than `n`, then it assigns `answr` as `(x + x + 1) * 2`.
  3. Otherwise, it assigns `answr` as `4 * (x + 1)`.
- Finally, it prints the minimum perimeter `answr` as an integer.

The code seems to correctly follow the problem description and the output hints. The conditions and the calculations align with the requirements of finding the shortest possible route that meets the specified conditions for the given number of city blocks. All examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the code.
