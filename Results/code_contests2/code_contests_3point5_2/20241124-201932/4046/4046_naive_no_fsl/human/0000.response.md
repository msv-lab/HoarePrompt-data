Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given program correctly finds the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to the input number 'n'. It iterates through all possible combinations of '4' and '7' of increasing length and checks if the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's. It then selects the minimum number that is greater than or equal to 'n' and outputs it. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it handles all potential cases correctly.
