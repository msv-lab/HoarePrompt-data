Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly takes a positive integer `n` as input and finds the least super lucky number that is greater than or equal to `n`. It generates all possible combinations of '4' and '7' of increasing lengths, checks if the count of '4's is equal to the count of '7's, and selects the minimum number that meets the criteria. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected based on the problem description.
