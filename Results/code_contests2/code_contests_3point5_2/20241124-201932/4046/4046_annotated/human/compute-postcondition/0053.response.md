According to the code, the loop will execute until the values of 'x' are generated based on the product of '74' repeated 'i' times. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

1. Since 'i' is adjusted to ensure the loop executes, it should be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
2. 'tem' is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in 'x' and is greater than or equal to 'n'. Therefore, 'tem' should be adjusted to be greater than the previous 'tem'.
3. The count of '7' in 'x' is equal to the count of '4', and 'x' contains the same number of '7's and '4's. This condition should be maintained in the next iteration.
4. 'ans' is the minimum value between 4444477777 and 'tem'. After the execution of the if statement, 'ans' will be updated to the minimum value between the current 'ans' and 'tem'. This condition should also be maintained.

State: **'n' is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, 'l' is less than 10 and even, 'ans' is the minimum value between 4444477777 and 'tem', 'i' is adjusted to ensure the loop executes again, 'tem' is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in 'x' and is greater than or equal to 'n', count of '7' in 'x' is equal to count of '4', x contains the same number of '7's and '4's, 'tem' is greater than or equal to 'n'**.
