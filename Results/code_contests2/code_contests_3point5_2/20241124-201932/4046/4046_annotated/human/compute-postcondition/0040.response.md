Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The value of `tem` is obtained by joining the characters in `x`, and it must be greater than or equal to `n`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, l is less than 10 and even, ans is the minimum of its updated value and the value of tem, i is adjusted to ensure the loop executes again, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, tem is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in x, tem is greater than or equal to n.
