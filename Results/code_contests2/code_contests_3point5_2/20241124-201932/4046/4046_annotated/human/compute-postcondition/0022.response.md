Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, l is less than 10, ans is the minimum value between 4444477777 and tem, the length of l is even, i is increased by 1, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x. If x.count('7') is equal to x.count('4'), tem is calculated as the integer value from the string x. If tem is greater than or equal to n, ans is updated to be the minimum value between the current ans and tem. The overall state maintains the initial conditions specified in the precondition, ensuring all adjustments and relationships are preserved for the program variables.***
