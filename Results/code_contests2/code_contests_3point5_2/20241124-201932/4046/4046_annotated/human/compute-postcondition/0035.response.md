Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. The value of `tem` is the integer obtained by joining the characters in `x`, and it is greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, after execution, `ans` will be updated accordingly. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, l is less than 10 and even, ans is the minimum of its updated value and the value of tem, i is adjusted to ensure the loop executes again, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, tem is greater than or equal to n**
