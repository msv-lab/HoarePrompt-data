According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and the conditions related to `x`, `tem`, `n`, and `ans`. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions were met such that the loop executed. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be modified to ensure the loop executes again. Other states need to remain the same.
State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, l is less than 10 and even, ans is the minimum of its updated value and the value of tem, i is adjusted to ensure the loop executes again, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, tem is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in x, tem is greater than or equal to n**
