Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input. It then calculates the minimum number greater than or equal to `n` that has an equal count of '7's and '4's in its digits. This is done by generating combinations of '74' of increasing lengths until the condition is met. The calculated number is then printed as the output. The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the user input `n`. **
