Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, the length of `l` is even, `i` is a positive integer, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value converted from the string `x`. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x` and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`.***
