Postcondition: ***'n' is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, 'l' is less than 10 and even, 'ans' is the minimum value between 4444477777 and 'tem', 'i' is adjusted to ensure the loop executes again, 'tem' is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in 'x' and is greater than or equal to 'n', count of '7' in 'x' is equal to count of '4', 'x' contains the same number of '7's and '4's. If the count of '7' in 'x' equals the count of '4' and 'tem' is greater than or equal to 'n', then 'tem' is calculated by joining the characters in 'x'. If 'tem' is greater than or equal to 'n', 'ans' is updated to be the minimum between the current 'ans' value and 'tem'.***
