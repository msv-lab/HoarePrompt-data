Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, l is less than 10, ans is the minimum value between 4444477777 and tem, the length of l is even, i is increased by 1, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, tem is the integer value converted from the string x after the adjustments for the next iteration. If the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, then tem is calculated from x. If tem is greater than or equal to n, ans is updated to be the minimum value between the current ans and tem.***
