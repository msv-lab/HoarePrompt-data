Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `tem`. As `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of `tem` will be retained. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, l is less than 10 and even, ans is the minimum of its current value and the value of tem, i is adjusted to ensure the loop executes, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, tem is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in x, and tem is greater than or equal to n.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, l is less than 10 and even, ans is the minimum of its current value and the value of tem, i is adjusted to ensure the loop executes, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, tem is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in x, and tem is greater than or equal to n**
