Postcondition: ***'n' is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, 'l' is less than 10 and even, 'ans' is the minimum value between 4444477777 and 'tem', 'i' is adjusted to ensure the loop executes, 'tem' is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in 'x' and is greater than or equal to 'n', count of '7' in 'x' is equal to count of '4', x contains the same number of '7's and '4's, 'tem' is greater than or equal to 'n'. After the execution of the if statement, 'ans' will be updated to the minimum value between the current 'ans' and 'tem'. This covers all edge cases including the conditions specified and ensures the correct handling of variable states after the if else block executes.***
