Output State: **If 'n' is within the specified range, 'l' is less than 10 and even, 'ans' will be the minimum value obtained from the iteration of 'tem' values greater than or equal to 'n' that have an equal count of '7's and '4's. The loop will continue iterating through the product of '74' until 'tem' is greater than or equal to 'n' and 'ans' will be updated accordingly. If 'tem' is never greater than or equal to 'n' for any 'x' values, 'ans' will remain at the initial value of 4444477777.**
