According to the code, in order for the loop to execute:
1. The variable 'i' must be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.
2. 'tem' must be greater than or equal to 'n'.
3. The count of '7' in 'x' must be equal to the count of '4'.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **'n' is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, 'l' is less than 10 and even, 'ans' is 4444477777, 'i' is adjusted to ensure the loop executes, 'tem' is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in 'x' and is greater than or equal to 'n', count of '7' in 'x' is equal to count of '4'**
