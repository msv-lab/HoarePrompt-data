According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^9.
- `l` remains less than 10.
- `ans` remains the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`.
- The length of `l` remains even.
- `i` needs to be increased by 1.
- The count of '7' in `x` is still equal to the count of '4' in `x`.
- If `x.count('7')` is equal to `x.count('4')`, `tem` is still calculated as the integer value from the string `x`.
- If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, the length of `l` is even, `i` is increased by 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`.**
