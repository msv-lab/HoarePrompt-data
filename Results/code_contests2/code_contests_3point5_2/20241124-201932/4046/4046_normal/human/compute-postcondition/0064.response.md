Output State: **If the count of '7' is equal to the count of '4' in string x, and the integer value of x is greater than or equal to n, then ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and the integer value of x. The loop will execute for all combinations of '74' repeated i times. If n is less than 74, or i is less than 1, or l is not the next even number greater than the current value of l, or tem is not updated based on loop conditions, the loop will not execute.**
