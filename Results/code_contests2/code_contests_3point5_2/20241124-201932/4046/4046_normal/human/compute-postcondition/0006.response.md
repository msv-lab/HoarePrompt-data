According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which is related to the length of the product of '74' based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute for some value of `i`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications are needed:
- Update `ans` to be 4444477777
- Update `n` to be a positive integer
- Update `l` such that it is the number of digits in `n` incremented by 1 if it was odd and is at least 2
- Set `i` based on the length of the product of '74' according to the updated `n`

State: **`ans` is 4444477777, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the number of digits in `n` incremented by 1 if it was odd and is at least 2, `i` is set based on the length of the product of '74' related to the updated `n`**
