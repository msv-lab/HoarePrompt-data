According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is at least 74, so that condition is satisfied. `l` is the next even number greater than the current value of `l`, so `l` needs to be updated to the next even number. `ans` is updated based on the loop conditions, so it needs to be accounted for as well. 
State: **`n` is at least 74, `l` is the next even number greater than the current value of `l`, `ans` is updated based on the loop conditions, `i` is at least 1**
