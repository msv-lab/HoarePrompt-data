Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 74, `l` is the next even number greater than the current value of `l`, `ans` is updated based on the loop conditions, `i` is at least 2, `tem` is the integer value of the concatenated string `x`. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then `tem` is assigned the integer value of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`.***
