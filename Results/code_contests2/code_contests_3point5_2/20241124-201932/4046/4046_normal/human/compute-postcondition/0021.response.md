Postcondition: ***`ans` is the minimum value between the initial `ans` and `tem`, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the number of digits in `n` incremented by 1 if it was odd and is at least 2, `i` is set based on the length of the product of '74' related to the updated `n`, the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the concatenation of digits in list `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the initial `ans` and `tem`.***
