Postcondition: ***`ans` is 4444477777, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the number of digits in `n` incremented by 1 if it was odd and is at least 2, `i` is set based on the length of the product of '74' related to the updated `n`, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. All variables maintain their initial conditions, with the additional constraint that the count of '7' in `x` must be equal to the count of '4' in `x` for the if statement block to be executed correctly. This ensures that `ans` is updated appropriately only if the specified conditions are met.***
