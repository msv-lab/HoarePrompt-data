Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 74, `l` is the next even number greater than the current value of `l`, `ans` is updated based on the loop conditions, `i` is at least 1, `tem` is the integer value of the string `x` after joining it. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then `tem` is calculated as the integer value of `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`. This logic covers all possible scenarios and edge cases for the given program fragment.***
