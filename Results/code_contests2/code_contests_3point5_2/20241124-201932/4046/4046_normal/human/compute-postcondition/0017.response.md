Postcondition: ***`ans` is the minimum value between the initial `ans` and `tem`. `n` is a positive integer. `l` is the number of digits in `n` incremented by 1 if it was odd and is at least 2. `i` is set based on the length of the product of '74' related to the updated `n`. The count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`. `tem` is the integer value of the concatenation of digits in list `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of the current `ans` and `tem`. This guarantees that `ans` remains as the minimum value between the original `ans` and the updated `tem` according to the specified conditions for `n`, `l`, `i`, count of '7's and '4's in `x`, and the concatenation of digits in `x`.***
