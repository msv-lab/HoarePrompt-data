Output State: **If `n` is at least 74, `l` is the next even number greater than the current value of `l`, `ans` is updated based on the loop conditions, `i` is at least 1, and `tem` is the integer value of the string `x` after joining it. The loop iterates through all combinations of '74' of length `i`, and if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is calculated as the integer value of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If no valid `x` is found, then `ans` remains unchanged.**
