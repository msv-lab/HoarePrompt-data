Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 74, `l` is the next even number greater than the current value of `l`, `ans` is updated based on the loop conditions, `i` is at least 2, and `tem` is the integer value of the concatenated string `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged.***
