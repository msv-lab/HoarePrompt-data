According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `i`, `l`, and `tem`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 74, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is the next even number greater than the current value of `l`, and `tem` is updated based on loop conditions, then the loop will execute.

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are not met for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **no adjustments required for the loop to execute one more time**
