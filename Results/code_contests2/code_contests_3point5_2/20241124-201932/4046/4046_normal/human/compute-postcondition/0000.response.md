Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, the value of `n` after execution will be the input integer provided. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9)**
