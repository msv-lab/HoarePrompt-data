Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the least super lucky number that is not less than the given input n. It iterates through all possible combinations of '4' and '7' of increasing lengths until it finds a super lucky number greater than or equal to n. The logic of counting the occurrences of '4' and '7' in the number and comparing them to determine if it is a super lucky number is implemented correctly. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
