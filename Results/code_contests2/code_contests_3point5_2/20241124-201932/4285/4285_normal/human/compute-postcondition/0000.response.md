Example Answer: 
The list comprehension iterates over each character in the string `n`, converts it to lowercase if it is an alphabet character, and then joins these characters back together into a new string assigned to `x`. Since `n` is a string containing alphanumeric characters, `x` will contain only the alphabet characters from `n` converted to lowercase. 
Output State: **`n` is a string containing alphanumeric characters; `x` is a string containing only lowercase alphabet characters from `n`**
