Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a string n containing alphanumeric characters. It then creates a new string x by converting all characters to lowercase and removing non-alphabetic characters. The function then checks if the string x is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) and returns True if it is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle cases where n is empty or only contains non-alphabetic characters. **
