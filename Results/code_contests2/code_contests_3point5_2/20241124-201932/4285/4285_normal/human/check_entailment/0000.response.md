Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not accurately solve the problem description. The function `func_1` only checks if the input string is a palindrome after converting all characters to lowercase and removing non-alphabetic characters. It does not generate the `n-th` even-length positive palindrome number as required by the problem description. The code does not handle the creation of even-length palindrome numbers based on the input value `n`. There is a lack of logic to generate the specific `n-th` even-length palindrome number. Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not meet the problem requirements.
