Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of joining all lowercase alphabetic characters from `n`. The `join` method combines these characters into a single string. If `n` contains non-alphabetic characters, they are excluded. The `lower` method converts all characters to lowercase. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string of alphanumeric characters, `x` is a string of lowercase alphabetic characters extracted from `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a string of alphanumeric characters, `x` is a string of lowercase alphabetic characters extracted from `n`**
