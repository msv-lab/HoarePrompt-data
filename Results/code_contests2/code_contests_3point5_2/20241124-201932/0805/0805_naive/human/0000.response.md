Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes an integer N and a string S as input, then shifts each character of S by N in alphabetical order and prints the resulting string. The program correctly handles shifting each character by N in alphabetical order within the constraints given. It calculates the new index of the character correctly by taking the modulus of 26 to ensure it stays within the range of the alphabet. The program works as expected for all uppercase English letters and N values from 0 to 26, as specified in the problem description.
