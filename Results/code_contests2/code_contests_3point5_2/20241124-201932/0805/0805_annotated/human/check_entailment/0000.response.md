Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes an integer `N` and a string `S` as input, then shifts each character of `S` by `N` in alphabetical order. The program correctly handles the shifting logic by calculating the new index for each character based on the given constraints. The loop iterates through each character in `S` and shifts it accordingly. The final result is printed as the new shifted string. The program satisfies the problem description for all potential cases and inputs provided.
