According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `strings` list. If there is at least one more string in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the `strings` list has at least one more string to iterate over. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `index` needs to be updated to the index of the first letter of the next string in the `letters` string after iterating over the current string.
- `added_index` needs to be updated to the result of `index + N` after considering the shift for the next string.
- `new_strings` needs to be updated with the new letter `new_s` resulting from shifting each letter in the next string by `N` positions.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string containing the result of shifting each letter in the next string by `N` positions, `strings` is a non-empty list of strings with at least one more string to iterate over, `index` is the index of the first letter of the next string in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + N`, and `new_strings` is updated with the new letter `new_s`**
