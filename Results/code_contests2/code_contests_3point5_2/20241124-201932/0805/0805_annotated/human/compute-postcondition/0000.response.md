Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The precondition specifies that N is an integer between 0 and 26. Therefore, the output state is: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26. S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4.**
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26. S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4.**
