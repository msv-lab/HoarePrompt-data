Example Answer: 
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + N`, where `N` is the integer between 0 and 26. The value of `index` is the index of the first letter of the next string in the `letters` string. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `added_index` is determined. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string containing the result of shifting each letter in `S` by `N` positions, `strings` is a non-empty list of strings with at least one more string to iterate over, `index` is the index of the first letter of the next string in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + N`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`, and `new_s` is the letter in the `letters` string at index `new_index`**
