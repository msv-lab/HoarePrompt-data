Example Answer:
The value of `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is the result of `index + N`. The value of `index` and `N` are not given, so the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string containing the result of shifting each letter in `S` by `N` positions, `strings` is a non-empty list of strings with at least one more string to iterate over, `index` is the index of the first letter of the next string in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + N`, and `new_s` is the letter in the `letters` string at index `new_index`.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string containing the result of shifting each letter in `S` by `N` positions, `strings` is a non-empty list of strings with at least one more string to iterate over, `index` is the index of the first letter of the next string in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + N`, and `new_s` is the letter in the `letters` string at index `new_index`**
