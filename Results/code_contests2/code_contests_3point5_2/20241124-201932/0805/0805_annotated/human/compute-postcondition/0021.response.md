Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the letter at index `new_index` in the `letters` string. The value of `new_index` is `added_index`, which is `index + N`. The value of `index` is the index of the first letter of the next string in the `letters` string. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string containing the result of shifting each letter in `S` by `N` positions, `strings` is a non-empty list of strings with at least one more string to iterate over, `index` is the index of the first letter of the next string in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + N`, and `new_strings` is updated with the new letter `new_s`.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string containing the result of shifting each letter in `S` by `N` positions, `strings` is a non-empty list of strings with at least one more string to iterate over, `index` is the index of the first letter of the next string in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + N`, and `new_strings` is updated with the new letter `new_s`**
