Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index` modulo 26. The value of `added_index` is the result of adding `index` and `N`, which are the index of the first letter of string `S` in the `letters` string and the given integer `N` respectively. The value of `index` can range from 0 to 25, and `N` can range from 0 to 26. Therefore, after the calculation, `new_index` will be between 0 and 25. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `strings` is a non-empty list of strings with `s` being the first string in the list, `index` is the index of the first letter of string `S` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + N`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`**
