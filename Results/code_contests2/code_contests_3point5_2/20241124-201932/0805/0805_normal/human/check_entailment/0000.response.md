Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes an integer `N` and a string `S` as input.
- It processes each character in `S` by shifting it by `N` positions in the English alphabet, considering wrap-around if the new index exceeds 26.
- The resulting string after processing each character in `S` is printed.
- The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases.
- The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code performs the required task accurately.
