Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that N is an integer between 0 and 26, the value of `n` will also fall within this range. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, n is an input integer.**
