Example Answer:
The value of `added_index` is calculated by adding `index` (which is the index of the first character of S in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ') with `n`. The initial state provides that `n` is 0, so the value of `added_index` will be the same as the `index`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, n is 0, letters is assigned the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, s is the first character in string S, index is assigned the index of the first character of S in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', added_index is the same as index.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, n is 0, letters is assigned the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, s is the first character in string S, index is assigned the index of the first character of S in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', added_index is the same as index**
