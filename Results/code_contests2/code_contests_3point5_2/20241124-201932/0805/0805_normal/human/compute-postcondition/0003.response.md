Example Answer: 
Since `new_strings` is an empty string, the code does not have any impact on the program. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, n is an input integer, letters is assigned the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, n is an input integer, letters is assigned the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string**
