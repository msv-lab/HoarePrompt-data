Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `N` and a string `S` from the user input. It then processes each character in `S` by shifting it by `N` positions in the English alphabet, considering wrap-around if the new index exceeds 26. The function prints the resulting string after processing each character in `S`. If the input string `S` is empty or `N` is 0, the function will not perform any processing and print an empty string.**
