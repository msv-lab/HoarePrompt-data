Example Answer: 
The new character `new_s` is added to the string `new_strings`. The value of `new_s` is determined by calculating the new index based on the sum of the current index and `n`, then taking the remainder after dividing by 26. The updated `new_strings` will contain the new characters based on the processed indices. The Output State is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string of uppercase English letters, n is 0, letters is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings contains the updated characters, s is the next character in S, index is the index of the next character of S in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', added_index is the sum of index and n, new_s is the character corresponding to the new calculated index, index is the index of the next character of S in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_index is the remainder of added_index divided by 26.
