Correctness: **True**

The program correctly takes an integer N and a string S as input, shifts each character of S by N in alphabetical order, and prints the resulting string. The program handles all uppercase English letters and correctly wraps around from 'Z' to 'A' when needed. The logic of finding the new index after shifting is correct and the program outputs the expected result for all potential cases.
