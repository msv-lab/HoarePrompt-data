According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, `j` is 3, and the result is 2. Since the result is 2, it indicates that the loop has executed at least twice. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, `j` is 3, and the result is 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, `j` is 3, and the result is 3**
