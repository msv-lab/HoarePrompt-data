Example Answer: 
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` is 2, which in binary is `10`. The rightmost set bit is in position 2, so the code returns 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and the code returns 2.
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and the code returns 2**
