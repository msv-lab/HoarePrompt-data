Example Answer:
The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since the loop prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to n, this operation changes the range of numbers being considered. Therefore, after execution, the loop will now print the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to n-1.
Output State: **The loop prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to n-1**
