Example Answer:
The expression `bin(j + 1)` returns the binary representation of the value of `j + 1`, which is 3. When reversed and searched for the first occurrence of '1', the index is found at position 0. Adding 1 to this index gives us 1. Therefore, the output state is `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and the output is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and the output is 1**
