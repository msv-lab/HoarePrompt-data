According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is not less than 1. To execute one more time, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The loop prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of the numbers from 1 to n, where n is greater than or equal to 1**
