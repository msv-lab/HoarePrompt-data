Example Answer: 
The code snippet calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 0, `j + 1` is 1, which in binary is '0b1'. The binary representation is '1', and the rightmost set bit is at position 0. Therefore, the output of the code snippet will be 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 0, and the output of the code snippet is 1**
