According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is at least 1. Since n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and it is decreased by 1 before the loop starts, n needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, the loop variable j will start from 0 and go up to n-1.

State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, j is 0**
