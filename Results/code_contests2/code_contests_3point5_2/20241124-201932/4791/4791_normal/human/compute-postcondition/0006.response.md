According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 500, `j` is 2. Since `j` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, j is 3, and the result is 2**
