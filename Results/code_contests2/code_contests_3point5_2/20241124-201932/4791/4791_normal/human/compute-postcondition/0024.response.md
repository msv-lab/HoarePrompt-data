According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and the code returns 2. Since `j` is less than `n` and the loop executed, `n` must be adjusted to at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 1, and the code returns 2**
