Example Answer:
The code calculates `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`, which first increments `j` by 1, then converts it to its binary representation, reverses the binary string, finds the index of the first '1' in the reversed string, and finally adds 1 to it. Since `j` is initially 0, after incrementing by 1, `j` becomes 1. The binary representation of 1 is '0b1', reversing it gives '1b0', and the index of the first '1' is 0. Adding 1 to it gives 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, j is 1.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, j is 1**
