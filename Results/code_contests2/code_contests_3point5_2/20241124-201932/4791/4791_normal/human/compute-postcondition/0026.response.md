According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3 and `j` is 1. Since the code returned 2, it means the loop executed at least once. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 2**
