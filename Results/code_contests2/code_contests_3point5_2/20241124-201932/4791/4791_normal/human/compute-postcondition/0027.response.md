Example Answer:
The code calculates `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. First, `j + 1` is calculated which results in 3. Then `bin(3)` converts 3 to binary which is '0b11'. The string is reversed to '11' and the index of the first occurrence of '1' is found which is 0. Since indexing starts from 0, we add 1 to get the final result of 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `j` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 2**
