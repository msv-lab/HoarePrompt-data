Example Answer:
The value of `n` is decreased by 1. The loop calculates and prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to n-1. The output state after running the code is: `n` is decreased by 1 and the loop continues to calculate and print the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to n-1.
Output State: **`n` is decreased by 1 and the loop continues to calculate and print the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to n-1**
