Example Answer: 
The code calculates the position of the rightmost `1` in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` is 2, and the binary representation of 2 is `10`. The rightmost `1` is at position 2, so the code returns 2. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 1, and the code returns 2**
