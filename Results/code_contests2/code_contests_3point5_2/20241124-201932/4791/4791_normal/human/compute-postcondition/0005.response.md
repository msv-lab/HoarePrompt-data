Example Answer:
The code calculates the binary representation of j + 1, reverses it, finds the position of the first '1' starting from the end, and adds 1 to get the final result. Since j is 2, j + 1 is 3, which in binary is '11'. Reversing it gives '11', and the position of the first '1' from the end is 1. Adding 1 to this gives the final result as 2.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, j is 2, and the result is 2**
