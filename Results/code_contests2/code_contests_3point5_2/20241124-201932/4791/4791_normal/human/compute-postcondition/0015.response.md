Example Answer: 
The expression `bin(j + 1)` converts j + 1 to a binary string, `[::-1]` reverses the string, `find('1')` finds the index of the first occurrence of '1', and `+ 1` adjusts the index to be 1-based. Since j is 1, j + 1 is 2, which in binary is '10'. Reversing it gives '01'. The index of the first '1' is 1, and adding 1 makes it 2. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the output is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the output is 2**
