Correctness: **False**

The code does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The code is supposed to set levels to the passages so that the number of times a passage is passed through is always even when returning to the starting room. However, the code provided does not set the levels of the passages as required. The logic in the code does not align with the problem description, and it does not provide the correct output based on the problem constraints.
