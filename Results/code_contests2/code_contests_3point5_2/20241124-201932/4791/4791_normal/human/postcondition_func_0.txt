The function `func` reads an input from the user, decrements the input value `n` by 1 each iteration, and then for each number from 1 to `n-1`, it prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of that number. The function does not have any explicit return value. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute.
