According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` needs to be adjusted to a different position. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` needs to be changed**
