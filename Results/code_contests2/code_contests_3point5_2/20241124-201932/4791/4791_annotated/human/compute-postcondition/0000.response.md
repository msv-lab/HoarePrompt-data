Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the input, which is a string. The value of `N` is not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a string**.
Output State: **Precondition: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a string**.
