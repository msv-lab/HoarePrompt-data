Example Answer: 
`j + 1` is calculated first, resulting in `1`. Then `bin(1)` converts `1` to binary, which is `'0b1'`. Reversing it gives `'1b0'`. Finding the index of the first occurrence of `'1'` gives `0`. Adding `1` to it gives `1`, which is then printed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 0, and the output of the code is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 0, and the output of the code is 1**
