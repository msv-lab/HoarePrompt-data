According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the output state is the current state after the previous iteration. To execute the loop one more time, you need to adjust the state such that `j` is incremented by 1 and `j` is less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **output state where `j` is incremented by 1 and `j` is less than `n**
