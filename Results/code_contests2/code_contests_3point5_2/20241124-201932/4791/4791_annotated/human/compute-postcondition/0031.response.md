Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute n times. For each iteration, the program will print the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of the current number in the range from 1 to n. After the loop finishes, n will be 0 and j will be n-1. If n is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.**
