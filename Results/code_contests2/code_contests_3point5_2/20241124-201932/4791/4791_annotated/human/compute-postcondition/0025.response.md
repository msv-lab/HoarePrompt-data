Example Answer:
The code calculates the binary representation of `j + 1`, reverses it, finds the position of the first occurrence of '1', and adds 1 to it. Given that `j` is 1, `j + 1` is 2, which in binary is '10'. Reversing it gives '01', and the position of the first '1' is 1. Adding 1 to it results in 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, the program prints 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, the program prints 2**
