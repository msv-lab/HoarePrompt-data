Output State: The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is calculated by finding the index of the rightmost '1' in the reversed binary representation of `j + 1`, which is then incremented by 1 and printed. The initial state is maintained: The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n+1` has changed, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` has changed.
