Example Answer: 
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j + 1. Here, j is 2, so j + 1 is 3, which in binary is 11. The rightmost set bit is at position 1 (from the right). The code then prints the position of the rightmost set bit, which is 1. The value of n and other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, the program prints 2**
