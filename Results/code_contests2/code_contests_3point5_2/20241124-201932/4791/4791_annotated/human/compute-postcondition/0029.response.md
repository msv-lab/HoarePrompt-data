Output State: **The loop calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of each number from 1 to n. If n is greater than 1, the loop will execute n times. The variable j ranges from 0 to n-1, and the program prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j+1. If n is 1 or less, the loop does not execute.**
