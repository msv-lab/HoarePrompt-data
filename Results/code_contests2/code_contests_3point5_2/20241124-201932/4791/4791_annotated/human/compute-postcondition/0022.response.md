According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is greater than 1, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, the position of the rightmost set bit for each number from 1 to n is calculated. So, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and `j` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 0**
