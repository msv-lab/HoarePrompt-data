According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 0, and the output of the code is 1. Since the output is 1, it indicates that the loop executed at least once. Therefore, the loop needs to execute one more time, so `j` needs to be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
