According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is calculated by finding the index of the rightmost '1' in the reversed binary representation of `j + 1`, which is then incremented by 1 and printed. The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n+1` has changed, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` has changed**
