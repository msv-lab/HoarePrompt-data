According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` has changed, it implies that the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` is now at a different position. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect `n` being greater than 0 and `j` starting at 0.
State: **The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` has changed, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
