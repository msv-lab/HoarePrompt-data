According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. To execute the loop one more time, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` needs to be adjusted to the next position where a set bit occurs. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 2`**
