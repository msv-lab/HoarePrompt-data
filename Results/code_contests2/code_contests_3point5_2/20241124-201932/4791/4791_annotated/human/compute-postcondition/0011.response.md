Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is decremented by 1. The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` changes. Therefore, the Output State is: The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` has changed.
Output State: **The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` has changed**
