According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2. Since `j` is 2, it is less than `n`, so the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to be 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 3**
