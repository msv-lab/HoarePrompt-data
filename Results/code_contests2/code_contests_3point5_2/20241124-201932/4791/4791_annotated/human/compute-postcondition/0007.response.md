Example Answer:
The code computes the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` and adds 1 to it. The value of `j` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of the rightmost set bit cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is unspecified.
Output State: **output state**
