Example Answer:
The value of `n` is decremented by 1. The loop will continue to calculate the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of each number from 1 to n. Since n is greater than 1, the loop will continue until n reaches 1. 
Output State: **The loop continues to calculate the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of each number from 1 to n, where n is greater than 1**.
