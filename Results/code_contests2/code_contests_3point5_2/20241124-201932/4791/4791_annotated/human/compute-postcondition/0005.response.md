Example Answer: 
The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 2` is calculated by first adding 1 to `j`, converting it to binary, reversing the binary representation, finding the index of the rightmost '1', and adding 1 to get the position. The output state is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 2` remains the same**
