According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` has changed, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n+1` should be different from the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n`, and `j` should be 1.
State: **The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n+1` has changed, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
