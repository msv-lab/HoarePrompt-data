According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the program prints 2. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, the program prints 2**
