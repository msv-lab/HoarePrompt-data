The function `func` reads an input integer `n`, decrements it in a loop, and for each iteration, prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers in the range from 1 to the decremented `n`. The function does not explicitly return any value. The code does not handle cases where the input `n` is not an integer or falls outside the range from 2 to 500.
