Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The code does not set levels to the passages such that the highest level of a passage is minimized. Instead, it seems to be printing some transformation of the loop index `j`. This does not ensure that the number of times we pass through a passage is always even as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
