Correctness: **False**

In the given program, the logic is not correctly implemented to set levels to the passages as required by the problem description. The program does not output the levels of the passages in the correct format and does not ensure that the number of times we pass through a passage is always even. Additionally, the logic inside the while loop is not appropriate for the problem.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
