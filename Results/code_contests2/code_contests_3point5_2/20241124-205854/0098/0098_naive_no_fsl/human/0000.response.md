Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum length of a side of the square that a 2n-gon can be embedded in for each test case. The formula used in the `func_1` function is mathematically correct for the given problem description. The program also handles multiple test cases as described in the input. The output is formatted to display the result with 9 decimal places. Since the program follows the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where it does not work correctly, the correctness is true.
