The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199. After executing the function body, the program returns the result of the mathematical operation involving `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an odd integer `n` within the range of 3 to 199, and return the result of a mathematical operation involving `n`.
