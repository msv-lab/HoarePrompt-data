The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199. The program returns the result of a mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine of specific angles based on the odd integer `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an odd integer `n` between 3 and 199 and return the result of a mathematical expression involving cosine and sine based on `n`.
