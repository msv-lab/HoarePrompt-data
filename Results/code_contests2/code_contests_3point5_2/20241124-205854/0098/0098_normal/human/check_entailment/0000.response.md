Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to be correct and follows the problem description for embedding a 2n-gon in a square. The function `func_1` takes an odd integer `n` between 3 and 199 and computes the result of a mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine of specific angles based on the given odd integer `n`. The output is then formatted to have a precision of 9 decimal places. The code seems to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the correctness of the code is **True**.
