Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum length of a side of the square in which the 2n-gon can be embedded. The program uses the formula `cos(pi / (4 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n))` to calculate the required minimum length. Since the program uses the appropriate mathematical formula and the input constraints are adhered to, the program is correct for all potential cases.
