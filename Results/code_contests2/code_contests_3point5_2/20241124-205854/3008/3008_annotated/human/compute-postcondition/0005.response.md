Example Answer:
The expression `2 * (n / 10) + s` is calculated. If `n` is not divisible by 10, `s` is set to 1; otherwise, `s` remains 0. Based on this, the result is calculated. The output state after execution is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is either 0 or 1**
