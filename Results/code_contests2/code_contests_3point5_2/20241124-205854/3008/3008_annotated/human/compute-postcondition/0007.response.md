Functionality: **The function `func` accepts no parameters. It attempts to read an input as an integer `n`, then checks if `n` is divisible by 10. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it sets `s` to 1; otherwise, `s` remains 0. Finally, the function prints the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`. However, there is a missing case where the division operation might result in a float which could lead to unexpected results.**
