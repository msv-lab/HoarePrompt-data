Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described in the prompt. The program is supposed to find the minimum number of subtractions needed to reduce a magic number to zero by subtracting a digit from it in each step. However, the given program simply calculates and prints an expression based on the input number without actually performing the required operations.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
