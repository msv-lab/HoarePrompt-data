Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It does not actually perform the required subtraction of a digit from the magic number until it reaches zero. Instead, it calculates the minimum number of operations based on the last digit of the input number. This approach does not guarantee the correct minimum number of operations required to reduce the magic number to zero. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
