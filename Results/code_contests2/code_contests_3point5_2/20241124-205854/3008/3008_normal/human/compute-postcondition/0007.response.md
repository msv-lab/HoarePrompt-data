Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an input as `n`, which is treated as a non-negative integer. If the last digit of `n` is not 0, it sets `s` to 1. Then, it calculates and prints the result of the formula 2 * (n / 10) + s. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. **
