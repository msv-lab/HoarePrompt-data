Correctness: **False**

The given code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints suggest that the code calculates the minimum number of operations required to reduce the magic number to zero by subtracting a digit from it until it equals zero. However, the code itself does not perform this operation correctly.

For example, if we take the input `24`, the expected output should be `5` according to the problem description. The correct sequence of subtractions would be: 24 → 20 → 18 → 10 → 9 → 0. 

But the code provided in the program simply checks if the last digit of `n` is not 0, and then calculates `2 * (n / 10) + s`, which is not a valid approach to solve the given problem. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
