Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of subtractions needed to reduce the magic number to zero. The program fails to account for the fact that the digit subtracted must be present in the number itself, as mentioned in the problem description. Additionally, the program uses integer division in Python 2.x, which may lead to incorrect results. 

For example, for the input 24, the expected output is 5 (24 -> 20 -> 18 -> 10 -> 9 -> 0). However, the given program will output a different result due to the issues mentioned.
