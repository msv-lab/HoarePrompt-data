You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is a_i. Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins between his pockets, but he cannot put two coins with the same value into the same pocket.

For example, if Polycarp has got six coins represented as an array a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2], he can distribute the coins into two pockets as follows: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4].

Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. Help him to do that.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of coins.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — values of coins.

Output

Print only one integer — the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.

Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    if (n == 11) :
        print(5)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer representing the number of coins (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a is a list of integers representing the values of coins (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). If n equals 11, the program prints 5. In all other cases, there is no change to the state of the variables n and a.
    c = [0] * 101
    for d in a:
        c[d] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If n is 11, all elements in list `c` are incremented by 1 based on the values in list `a`. For any other value of n, the loop does not execute and there is no change to the variables `n` and `a`.
    print(max(c))

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
