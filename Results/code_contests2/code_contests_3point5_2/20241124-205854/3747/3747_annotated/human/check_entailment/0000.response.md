Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. It does not correctly solve the problem described. The program only prints the maximum frequency of a coin value in the list, which is not the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all coins as per the problem statement.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input
6
1 2 4 3 3 2

Expected Output
2

The program will output 2 in this case, but the correct output is 2 pockets needed to distribute the coins, not the maximum frequency of a coin value.
