The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a list `a` of integers representing the values of coins. If `n` is equal to 11, it prints 5. Otherwise, it creates a list `c` and increments the count of each value in `a` in `c`. Finally, it prints the maximum value in the list `c`. The function does not have any return value.
