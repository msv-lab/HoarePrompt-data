Example Answer:
The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1, where `d` is a value from the list `a`. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `c` are unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 11, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, and `c[d]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is 11, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `c[d]` is incremented by 1**
