Example Answer: 
A list `c` is created with 101 elements initialized to 0. This list is not related to the variables `n` and `a`, so the state of those variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: *n is an integer representing the number of coins (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a is a list of integers representing the values of coins (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). If n equals 11, the program prints 5. In all other cases, there is no change to the state of the variables n and a.*
