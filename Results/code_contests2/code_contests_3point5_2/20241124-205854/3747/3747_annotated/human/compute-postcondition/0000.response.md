Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of an integer input. The value of `n` represents the number of coins, so it can vary from 1 to 100. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of coins (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a is a list of integers representing the values of coins (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a is a list of integers representing the values of coins (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100)**
