Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. The values of the list `a` depend on the input provided, which are integers representing the values of coins. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of coins (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a is a list of integers representing the values of coins (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a is a list of integers representing the values of coins (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100)**
