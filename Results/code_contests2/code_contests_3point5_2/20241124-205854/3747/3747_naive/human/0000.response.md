Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. It only counts the maximum number of coins of a particular value, which is not the same as finding the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all the coins. 

For example, if the input is:
```
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
```
The correct output should be 3 (one pocket for each unique coin value), but the program will output 3 as it counts the maximum number of coins of a particular value (2) instead of the minimum number of pockets needed.
