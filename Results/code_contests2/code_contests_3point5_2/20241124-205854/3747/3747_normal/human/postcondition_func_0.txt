The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a list `a` containing integer values of the coins. If `n` is equal to 11, it prints 5. Then, it creates a list `c` with 101 zeros and increments the count of each coin value in `a`. Finally, it prints the maximum count of any coin value in the list `c`. The function does not return any value directly but operates on the global variables `n`, `a`, and `c`.
