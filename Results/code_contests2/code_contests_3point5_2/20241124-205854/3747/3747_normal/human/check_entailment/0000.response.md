Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for all potential cases. The code only considers the case when `n` is equal to 11 and prints 5, which is not specified in the problem description. This means that for any other value of `n`, the code does not provide the correct output. Additionally, the code does not correctly determine the minimum number of pockets required to distribute all the coins as described in the problem. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
