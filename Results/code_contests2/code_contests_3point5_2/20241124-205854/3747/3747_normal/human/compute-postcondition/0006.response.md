According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `c` is a list of 101 zeros and `n` is an integer representing the number of coins, we need to adjust the states such that `a` has at least 1 element, `d` is the first element in `a`, and `n` is equal to the number of elements in `a`.
State: **`n` is equal to the number of elements in `a`, `a` has at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 zeros, `d` is the first element in `a`**
