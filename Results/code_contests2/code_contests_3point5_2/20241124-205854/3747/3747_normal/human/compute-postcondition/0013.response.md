Output State: **`n` is equal to the number of elements in `a`, `a` has at least 1 element, `c` has 101 zeros except for the element at index `d` which is incremented by 1, `d` is the last element in `a`. If `a` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `n` remains 0, `c` remains a list of 101 zeros, and `d` is not defined**
