Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values inputted after splitting them by spaces and converting them to integers. The values of `n` and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of coins (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a is a list of integers representing the values of the coins (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a is a list of integers representing the values of the coins (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100)**
