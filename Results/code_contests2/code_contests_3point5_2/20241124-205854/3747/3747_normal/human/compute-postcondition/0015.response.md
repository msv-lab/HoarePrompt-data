The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the global variables `n` and `a`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of coins and `a` is a list of integers representing the values of the coins. The constraints are that `n` should be between 1 and 100, and each element in `a` should be between 1 and 100.

The function does not return any value directly, but it performs some operations based on the values of `n` and `a`.
