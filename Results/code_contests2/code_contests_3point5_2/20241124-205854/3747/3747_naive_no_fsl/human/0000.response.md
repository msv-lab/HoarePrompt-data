Correctness: False

The given program is incorrect. It only considers a special case where n is equal to 11 and prints 5, which is not a valid approach. The program should find the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all the coins such that no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.

The correct approach would be to count the frequency of each coin value and then find the maximum frequency, which represents the minimum number of pockets needed. The program does not implement this logic and hence is incorrect.
