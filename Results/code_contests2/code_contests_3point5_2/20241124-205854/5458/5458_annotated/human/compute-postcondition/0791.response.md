Output State: 
- `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. The value of `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, and `m` is at least 1. 
- If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. 
- If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop code.
- In cases where the loop does not execute, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
