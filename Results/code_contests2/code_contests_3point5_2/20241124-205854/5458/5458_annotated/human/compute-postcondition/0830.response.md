Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known as 0, `j`, and 1 respectively. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
