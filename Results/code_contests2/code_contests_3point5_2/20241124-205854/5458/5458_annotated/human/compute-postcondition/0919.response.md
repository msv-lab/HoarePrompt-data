Postcondition: ***`s`, `k + 1`, `j`, `i`, `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are variables. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` becomes `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All other variables retain their initial values after the execution of the if else block. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the given program fragment.***
