According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is at least 1 since it is used in the range of `k`. Before the loop starts, `s`, `k`, and `j` are less than `m` which satisfies the loop condition. However, for the loop to execute, `i` should be adjusted to be less than `n^2` and `m` should remain at least 1.
State: **`s`, `k`, `j` are less than `m`, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1**
