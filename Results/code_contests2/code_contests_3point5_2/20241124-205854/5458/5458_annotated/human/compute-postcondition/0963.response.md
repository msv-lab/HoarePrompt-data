According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` retain their initial values. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `k` needs to be incremented by 1 since the loop variable `k` will move to the next value.
2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 4, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` retain their initial values**
