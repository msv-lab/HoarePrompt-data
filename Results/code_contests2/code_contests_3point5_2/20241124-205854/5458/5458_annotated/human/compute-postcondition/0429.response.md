Postcondition: ***`m` and `s` are integers at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is then increased by the modulus of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`. All other variables maintain their initial constraints.***
