According to the loop statement, the loop will execute for each value of `k` ranging from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `mod` remains 100000
- `n` stays greater than 0
- `m` is at least 1
- `s` is greater than 0
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with the value at index `[1][2][k]` updated
- `i` is either 0 or not
- `j` is 1
- `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to update the following:
- Since the loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s + 1`, we need to increment `k` by 1.
- The state of the variable `k` needs to be updated to reflect this change.

State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with the value at index `[1][2][k]` updated, `i` is either 0 or not, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2`**
