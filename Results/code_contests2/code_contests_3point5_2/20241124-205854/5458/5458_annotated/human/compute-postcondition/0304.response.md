Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `s` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. After the execution of the if block, the state of the program variables is updated such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` when `j > k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to accommodate all possible edge cases and accurately reflect the changes made by the program fragment.***
