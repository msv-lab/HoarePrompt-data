Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is updated for the next iterations, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is adjusted to the next value from the current value to `s`, inclusive. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. In all other cases, including when `i` is not 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated according to the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = (dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j]) % mod`***
