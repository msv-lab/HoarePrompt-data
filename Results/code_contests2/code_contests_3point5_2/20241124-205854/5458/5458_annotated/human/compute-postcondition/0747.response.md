Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, but `k` is given as 3 in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
