Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` retain their initial values. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and the loop continues. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
