Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 for the first iteration or updated for the next iterations, `j` is always 1, `k` is set to `s + 1`. In the if part, if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at the position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
