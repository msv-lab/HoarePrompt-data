At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

- `j` should be incremented by 1.
- `k` should be adjusted to take the next value from 1 to `s` inclusive.
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be assigned the value 1.
- If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be updated to the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then incremented by the modulo of the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 for the first iteration or updated for the next iterations, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is adjusted to the next value from 1 to `s` inclusive**.
