Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i` are variables with specific initial conditions. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After the execution of the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
