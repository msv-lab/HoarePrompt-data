Output State: **`s`, `k`, `j` are less than `m`, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo `mod`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.**
