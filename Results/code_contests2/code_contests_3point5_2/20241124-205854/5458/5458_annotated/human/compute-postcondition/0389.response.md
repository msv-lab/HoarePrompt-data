Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `j` is equal to m + 1, `k` is less than or equal to s. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. This assignment covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment.***
