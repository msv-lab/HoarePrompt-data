Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, the value at index [1][2][k] is updated, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1 and less than or equal to `m`, `k` is within the range [2, s]. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
