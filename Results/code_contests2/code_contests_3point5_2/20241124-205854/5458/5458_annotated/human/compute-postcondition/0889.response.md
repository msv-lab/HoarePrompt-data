Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `j`, `i`, `m` have the specified initial values.
Output State: **`s`, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `j`, `i`, `m` have the specified initial values**
