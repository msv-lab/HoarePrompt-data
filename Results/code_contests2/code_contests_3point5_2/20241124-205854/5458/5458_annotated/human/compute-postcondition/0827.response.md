According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `k` needs to be set to 1 as it starts from 1. `i` should be set to 0 or updated according to the formula provided. `j` should be updated to 1 as it starts from 1 and goes up to `m`. Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:
State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is either 0 or updated according to the formula, `j` is 1 to `m`**
