Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. In all other cases, including when `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If `j` is not greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the remainder of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] divided by `mod`, and then incremented by the remainder of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] divided by `mod`.***
