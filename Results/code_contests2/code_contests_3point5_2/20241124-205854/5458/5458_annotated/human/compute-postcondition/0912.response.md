Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of the variables are `s`, `k + 1`, `j`, `i`, `m`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `k + 1`, `j`, `i`, `m`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`s`, `k + 1`, `j`, `i`, `m`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
