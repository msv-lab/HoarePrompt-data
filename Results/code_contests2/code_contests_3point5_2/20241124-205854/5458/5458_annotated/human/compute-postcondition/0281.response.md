Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is updated for the next iterations, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is less than `s`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp` at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp` at position `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
