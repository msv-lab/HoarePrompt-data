Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` retain their initial values. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
