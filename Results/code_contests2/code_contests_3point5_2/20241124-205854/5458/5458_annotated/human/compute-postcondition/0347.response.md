Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly mentioned, so the output state is: `mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is s + 1, and the assignment operation mentioned in the code is executed.
Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is s + 1, and the assignment operation mentioned in the code is executed**
