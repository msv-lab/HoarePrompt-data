Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `s` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. The program fragment correctly handles all edge cases and updates the values of the variables accordingly.***
