According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is in the range from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for adjusting the states are based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Therefore, if this condition is met, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be adjusted accordingly.

2. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In this case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` should be adjusted.

3. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed based on the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and increased by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. Adjustments need to be made to these values.

4. Finally, `k` needs to be adjusted to the next integer value in the range of 1 to `s` + 1.

State: **`i`, `j`, and `k` are integers satisfying the conditions mentioned above, `dp` values are adjusted accordingly based on the conditions, and `k` is updated to the next integer value in the range of 1 to `s` + 1.**
