According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, `m` have the specified initial values. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is a positive integer and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula provided. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `k` is less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`s`, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `j`, `i`, `m` have the specified initial values.**
