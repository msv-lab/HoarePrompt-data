According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` ranges from 1 to m + 1. Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states before the loop starts are as follows:
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 or non-zero, `j` ranges from 1 to m + 1, `k` ranges from 1 to s + 1**.
