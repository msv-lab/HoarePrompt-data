Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` retain their initial values. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is less than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
