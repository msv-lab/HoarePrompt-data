Postcondition: ***mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is at least 1, s maintains its input integer value, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where the values are updated based on the conditions. If i == 0 and j >= k, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. Otherwise, if j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. If neither of these conditions hold, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. The program handles all cases regarding the values of i, j, and k, ensuring the proper manipulation and update of the dp array.***
