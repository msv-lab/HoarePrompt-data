Postcondition: ***`s`, `k` are less than or equal to `s`. The variables `j`, `i`, `m` have the specified initial values. After the execution of the if-else block, the elements of the array `dp` are updated based on the conditions. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` or to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` plus the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The values of `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
