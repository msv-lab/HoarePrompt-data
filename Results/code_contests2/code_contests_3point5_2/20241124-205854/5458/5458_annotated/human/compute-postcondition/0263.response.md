Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is updated for the next iterations, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is adjusted to the next value from 1 to `s` inclusive. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program continues with these updated variable values for the next iteration.**
