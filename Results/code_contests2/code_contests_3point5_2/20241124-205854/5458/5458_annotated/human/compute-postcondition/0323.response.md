Output State: **mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is still at least 1, s maintains its input integer value, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values based on the conditions inside the loop. The values of i can be either 0 or non-zero, j ranges from 1 to m + 1, and k ranges from 1 to s + 1. The loop executes according to the specified conditions, updating dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] accordingly. The final output is the result of dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod.**
