According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s`, `k` are less than `s`, `j` are less than `m`, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1, and `k` is less than `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s`, `k + 1` are less than `s`, `j` are less than `m`, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1, and `k + 1` is less than `s`**
