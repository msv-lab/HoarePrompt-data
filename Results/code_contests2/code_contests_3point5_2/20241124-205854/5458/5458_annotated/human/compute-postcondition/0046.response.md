Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is still at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) filled with 0s except for dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] which is assigned the value 1, `i` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` ranges from 1 to s where the value of `j` is greater than or equal to `k. The if statement sets dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] to 1 when j is greater than or equal to k.***
