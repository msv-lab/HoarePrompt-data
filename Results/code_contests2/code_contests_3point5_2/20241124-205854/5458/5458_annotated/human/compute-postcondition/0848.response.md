Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` is either 0 or updated according to the formula, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value in the dp array at position [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
