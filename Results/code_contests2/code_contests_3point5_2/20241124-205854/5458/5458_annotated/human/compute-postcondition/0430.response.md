According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` and `s` are integers at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be incremented by 1.

State: **`m` and `s` are integers at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s` + 1**
