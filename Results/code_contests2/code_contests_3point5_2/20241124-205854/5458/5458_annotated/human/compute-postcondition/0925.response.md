Postcondition: ***`s`, `k + 1`, `j`, `i`, `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are variables. If the loop is to execute again, `j` should be less than `k`. After the execution of the if statement, the values of `s`, `k + 1`, `j`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged. The loop will continue as `j` is less than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
