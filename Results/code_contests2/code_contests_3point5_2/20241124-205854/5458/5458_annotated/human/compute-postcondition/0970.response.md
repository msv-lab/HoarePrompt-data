Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely unless there is a condition inside the loop that breaks the loop. As there is no condition provided in the loop body that can break the loop, we can assume that the loop will execute one more time based on the given information.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, no states need to be adjusted and we can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, `mod` are positive integers**.
