According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to s (inclusive), the loop will execute if s is at least 1. Before the loop starts, adjust the state to ensure `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is 1.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
