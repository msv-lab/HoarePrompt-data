Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is adjusted to the next value from 1 to `s` inclusive. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. This holds true for all scenarios and edge cases where the conditions specified are met.***
