According to the code, the loop will execute at least once if `s` is greater than or equal to 1. After the loop executes, `k` will be equal to the number of iterations of the loop. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1. Since the loop will execute at least once, `k` will be updated to the number of iterations of the loop. All other variables will retain their initial values. 
State: **If `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to the number of iterations of the loop, all other variables retain their initial values**
