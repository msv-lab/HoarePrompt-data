Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. In other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.***
