Output State: **The loop continues indefinitely taking input for `n`, `m`, and `s` until `n`, `m`, `s` are all equal to 0. The `dp` 2D list is updated according to the conditions within the loop. The loop control variables `i`, `j`, `k` are iterated through based on the specified ranges. The modulo operation is applied to the final result printed after the loop finishes. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, `mod` are maintained as positive integers throughout the loop execution.**
