Output State: **`m` and `s` are integers at least 1. If `j` > `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` <= `k`, then `i` is 0 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In both cases, `k` is incremented by 1 and the modulo value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is added to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, followed by updating the result with a modulo operation using `mod`.**
