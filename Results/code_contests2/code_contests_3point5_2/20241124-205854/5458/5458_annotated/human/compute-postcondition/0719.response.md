According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `mod` are updated accordingly**
