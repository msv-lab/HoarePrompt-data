Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is updated for the next iterations, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is adjusted to the next value from the current value to `s`, inclusive. After the if statement executes, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. All preconditions are maintained, and the program progresses to the next iteration with the specified updates.***
