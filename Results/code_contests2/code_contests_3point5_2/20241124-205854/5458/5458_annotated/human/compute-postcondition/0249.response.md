According to the code, the loop executes for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 for the first iteration or updated for the next iterations, `j` is always 1, `k` is set to `s + 1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `k` needs to be updated to `s + 2` to include the next value of `k`.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 for the first iteration or updated for the next iterations, `j` is always 1, `k` is set to `s + 2**.
