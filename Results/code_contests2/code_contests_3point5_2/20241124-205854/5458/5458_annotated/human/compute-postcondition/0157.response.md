Output State: **mod remains 100000, n is greater than 0, m is at least 1, s is at least 2, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, i is non-zero, j is updated to m + 1, k is 1. If j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
