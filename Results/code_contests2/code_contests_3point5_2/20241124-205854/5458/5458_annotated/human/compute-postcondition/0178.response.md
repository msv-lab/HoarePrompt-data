According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 or non-zero, `j` is updated to `m + 1`, `k` is 4**
