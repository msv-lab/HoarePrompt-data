According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to 2 to satisfy the condition `k` is less than or equal to `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
