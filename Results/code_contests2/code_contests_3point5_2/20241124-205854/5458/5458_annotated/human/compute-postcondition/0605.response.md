Postcondition: ***mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is at least 1, s is greater than 0, the value at index [1][2][k] is updated, i is less than n, j is greater than 1 and less than or equal to m, k is within the range [1, s]. If i is 0 and j >= k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is not 0, and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the modulo of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] with mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by the modulo operation of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] with mod.***
