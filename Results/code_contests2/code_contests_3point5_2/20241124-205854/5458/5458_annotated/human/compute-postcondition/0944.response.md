Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` retain their initial values. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases, including when `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is first calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then added to the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to get the final value. All other variables remain unchanged.***
