Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 or non-zero, `j` is updated to `m + 1`, `k` is 3. If j > k, the value in dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the same value as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
