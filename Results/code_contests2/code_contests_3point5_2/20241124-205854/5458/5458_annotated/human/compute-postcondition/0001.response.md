Example Answer:
`n, m, s` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since `raw_input().split()` accepts an input and splits it, and `map(int, ...)` converts the input values to integers, `n, m, s` will be integers based on the input provided. The initial state value of `mod` is not affected.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are input integers**
