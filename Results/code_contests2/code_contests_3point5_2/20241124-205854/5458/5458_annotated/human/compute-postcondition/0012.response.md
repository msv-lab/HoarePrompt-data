Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an input integer, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized with all elements as 0, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. After the execution of the program fragment, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. All other elements in `dp` remain unchanged.***
