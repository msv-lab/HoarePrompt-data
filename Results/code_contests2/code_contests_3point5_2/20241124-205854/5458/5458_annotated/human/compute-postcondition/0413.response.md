Output State: `m` and `s` are integers at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` >= `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` > `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In this case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with `mod`. Additionally, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. `k` is incremented by 1.
