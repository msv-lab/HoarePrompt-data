Postcondition: ***`m` and `s` are integers at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` >= `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` > `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `k` incremented by 1. In the case of `j >= k`, the program sets `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1. If `j` > `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` <= `k`, then `i` is 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all scenarios, `k` is incremented by 1, and the modulo value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is added to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, followed by updating the result with a modulo operation using `mod`.***
