Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is updated to `m + 1`, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. This postcondition covers all possible edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the if block executes.***
