According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on certain conditions. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is incremented by 1**
