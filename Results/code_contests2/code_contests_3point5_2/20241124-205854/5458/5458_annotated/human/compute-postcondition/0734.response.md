Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0, `j` is an integer. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, otherwise no changes are made to the variables. If `i` is not 0, `j` is an integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
