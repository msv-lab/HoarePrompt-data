According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions inside the if-else block. Additionally, `s` remains a positive integer, and `k` is incremented by 1 after the execution of the if-else block.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1 to satisfy the loop condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions inside the if-else block, `s` remains a positive integer, `k` is incremented by 1.**
