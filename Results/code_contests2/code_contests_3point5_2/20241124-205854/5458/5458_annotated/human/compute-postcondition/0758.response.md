According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `s` is a positive integer, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `i` is less than `n^2`. For the loop to execute, in addition to the existing states, `m` must be at least 1. 
State: **`s` is a positive integer, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1**
