Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 for the first iteration or updated for the next iterations, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is adjusted to the next value from 1 to `s` inclusive. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. For all other cases where `i` is not 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Additionally, in these cases, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by taking the modulo of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] with `mod` and adding the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] with `mod`. This postcondition covers all scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment.***
