Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known to be integers. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers where `k` is less than `s.`
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers where `k` is less than `s**`.
