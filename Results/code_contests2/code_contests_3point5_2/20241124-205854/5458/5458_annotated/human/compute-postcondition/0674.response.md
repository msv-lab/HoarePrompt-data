Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. All variables remain unchanged except for dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. 
Output State: **All variables (n, m, s, dp, k, i) remain unchanged except for dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] which is updated according to the provided condition**.
