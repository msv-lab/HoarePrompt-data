Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 3, `i` is either 0 or updated according to the formula, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After the execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is further modified to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This postcondition ensures the integrity of the program variables and covers all possible scenarios of the if else block, including the boundary values and edge cases.***
