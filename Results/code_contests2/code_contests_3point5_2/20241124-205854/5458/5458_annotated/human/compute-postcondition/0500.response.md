Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with the value at index `[1][2][k + 1]` updated, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is set to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The calculation involves incrementing `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases after the if else block executes.***
