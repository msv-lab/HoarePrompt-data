Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the program maintains the following conditions: `mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is still at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) filled with updated values, `k` is incremented by 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Additionally, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the remainder of the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] divided by `mod`, and this result is then added to the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo `mod`. All other variables retain their initial values and relationships.***
