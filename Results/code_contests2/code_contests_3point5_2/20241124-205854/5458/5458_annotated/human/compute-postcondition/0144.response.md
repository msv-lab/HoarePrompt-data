According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 or non-zero, `j` ranges from 1 to m + 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- The `k` value needs to be incremented by 1.
- No other states need to be adjusted as the loop is not dependent on any other variables.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 or non-zero, `j` ranges from 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 2 to s + 1**
