Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with the value at index `[1][2][k]` updated, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is set to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is incremented by the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
