According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers, and `k` is an integer in the range of 1 to `s`. The conditions within the if-else block ensure that `i`, `j`, and `k` remain integers, and `k` stays within the range of 1 to `s`. Since `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by the loop itself, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i`, `j`, and `k` are integers, and `k` is an integer in the range of 1 to `s`**
