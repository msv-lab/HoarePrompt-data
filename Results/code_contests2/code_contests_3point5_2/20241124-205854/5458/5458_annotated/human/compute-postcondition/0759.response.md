According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. Therefore, the initial state needs to ensure that `s` is a positive integer. Additionally, since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `j` should be greater than or equal to 1. Given that `i` is less than `n^2`, `i` should be less than `n^2`. Lastly, since `m` is at least 1, the state should include `m` being 1 or greater.

State: **`s` is a positive integer, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1**
