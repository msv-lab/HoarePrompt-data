According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions hold: 
- `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers.
- If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
- If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then increased by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.
- `k` is adjusted to the next integer value in the range of 1 to `s` + 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`i`, `j`, and `k` are integers. `k` is an integer in the range of 1 to `s`.**
