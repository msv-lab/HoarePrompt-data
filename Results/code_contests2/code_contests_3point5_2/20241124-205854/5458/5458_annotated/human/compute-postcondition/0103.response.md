Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, with `mod` remaining 100000, `n` staying greater than 0, `m` still at least 1, `s` maintaining its input integer value, `dp` being a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), with updated values, `j` being incremented to the next value for the next iteration, and `k` being incremented to the next value, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. This postcondition encompasses all possible scenarios and edge cases for the given program fragment.***
