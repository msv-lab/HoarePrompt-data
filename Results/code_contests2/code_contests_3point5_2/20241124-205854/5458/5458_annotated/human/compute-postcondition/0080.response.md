Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is still at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `j` is incremented to the next value for the next iteration, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0. In the case where `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. All variables retain their respective values and relationships as described in the precondition, and the program executes correctly with the assigned value for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` after the if statement.***
