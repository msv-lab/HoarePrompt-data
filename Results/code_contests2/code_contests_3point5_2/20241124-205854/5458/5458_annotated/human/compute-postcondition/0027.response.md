Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an input integer, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized with all elements as 0, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1. After the execution of the if block, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
