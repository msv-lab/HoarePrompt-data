According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the variables `k` and `s` need to be adjusted. Before the loop starts, all other variables are not relevant to the loop execution.
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0**
