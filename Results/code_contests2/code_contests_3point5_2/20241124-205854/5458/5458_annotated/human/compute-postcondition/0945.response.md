According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `k` needs to be adjusted. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` retain their initial values**
