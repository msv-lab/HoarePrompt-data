Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions inside the if-else block. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`, and then added by the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`. Additionally, `s` remains a positive integer, and `k` is incremented by 1 after the execution of the if-else block.***
