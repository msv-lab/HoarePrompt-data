According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 for the first iteration or updated for the next iterations, `j` is always 1, and `k` has taken values from 1 to `s`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` should be updated to the next value after the last iteration, which is `s + 1`.
- No other states need adjustment for the next iteration.

State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 for the first iteration or updated for the next iterations, `j` is always 1, `k` is adjusted to `s + 1`.**
