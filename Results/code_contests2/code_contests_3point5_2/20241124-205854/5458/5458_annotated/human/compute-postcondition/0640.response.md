According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than `s` and `k` should be incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: *`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers where `k` is less than `s` and `k` is incremented by 1*
