According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1. `k` will iterate from 1 to `s` inclusive. Before the loop starts, `j` is equal to `m + 1` should be adjusted to `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), j is equal to m + 1, k is 1**
