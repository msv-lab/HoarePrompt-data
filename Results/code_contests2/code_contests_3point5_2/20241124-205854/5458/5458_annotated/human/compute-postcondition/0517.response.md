According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is in the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers, and the conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since `k` is currently in the range of 1 to `s` inclusive, for the next iteration, `k` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next value in the range.

State: **After the if-else block executes, `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then increased by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. `k` should be adjusted to the next integer value in the range of 1 to `s` + 1.**
