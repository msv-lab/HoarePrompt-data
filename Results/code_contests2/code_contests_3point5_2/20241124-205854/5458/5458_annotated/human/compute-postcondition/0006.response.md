According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, if `n`, `m`, and `s` are all 0, the program breaks out, so for the loop to execute `n` needs to be greater than 0. Additionally, the loop iterates `n ** 2` times, so at the start of the loop, `i` should be 0. 
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `s` are input integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized with all elements as 0, `i` is 0**
