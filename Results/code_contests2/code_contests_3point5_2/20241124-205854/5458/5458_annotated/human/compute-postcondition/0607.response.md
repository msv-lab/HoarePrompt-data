Output State: **If `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the loop will execute. After the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, the value at index [1][2][k] is updated, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are updated accordingly, and `k` is within the range [1, s]. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the loop does not execute.**
