According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k` is 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` is either 0 or updated according to the formula, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`**
