According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` ranges from 1 to `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. The value of `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, and `m` is at least 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `j` is currently at the end of its range (equal to `m`), it needs to be adjusted to be less than `m` to continue the loop.
- No other states need to be adjusted as per the provided conditions.

State: **`s`, `k`, `j` is less than `m`, `i`, `m` are positive integers where `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, and `m` is at least 1**
