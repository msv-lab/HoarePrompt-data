Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is still at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `j` is incremented to the next value for the next iteration, `k` is 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while maintaining the specified relationships between the variables and their values.***
