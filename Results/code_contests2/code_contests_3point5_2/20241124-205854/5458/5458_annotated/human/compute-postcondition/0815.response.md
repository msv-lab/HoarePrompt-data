According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` and `k` are less than `s`, `j` are less than `m`, `i` is less than `n^2`, and `m` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. In all other cases, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. After the execution of the if-else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` or `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` added to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` depending on the conditions met. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`s`, `k` are less than `s`, `j` are less than `m`, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1, and `k` is less than `s`**
