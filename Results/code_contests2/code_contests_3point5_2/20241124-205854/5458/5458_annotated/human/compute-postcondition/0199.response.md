Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, `s` is a positive integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program state remains unchanged.***
