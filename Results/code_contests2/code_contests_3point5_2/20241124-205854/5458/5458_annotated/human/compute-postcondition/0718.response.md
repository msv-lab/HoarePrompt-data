Postcondition: ***`k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i == 0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i != 0` and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The overall state of the program variables `dp`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `mod` are updated accordingly after the execution of the if else block, ensuring consistency in the relationships and values of the variables.***
