Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 or non-zero, `j` is updated to `m + 1`, `k` is 3. After the if statement executes, the entry `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, ensuring that the specific cell in the 2D list `dp` is updated with the value 1. All the initial conditions and updated values remain as described, covering all possible edge cases.***
