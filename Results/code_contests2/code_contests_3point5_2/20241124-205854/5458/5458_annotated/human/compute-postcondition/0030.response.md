According to the provided information, we need to adjust the states to ensure the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `mod` is 100000
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` is at least 1
- `s` is an input integer
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized with all elements as 0
- `i` is either 0 or not 0
- `j` is greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is equal to `s + 1
- In the case where `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1.
- For all other cases when `i` is not 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], otherwise, it is updated to the sum of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod and dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states accordingly. In this case, we need to increment `k` by 1 to satisfy the loop condition `xrange(1, s + 1)`. Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration should be:
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an input integer, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized with all elements as 0, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 2**
