Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an input integer, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized with all elements as 0, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
