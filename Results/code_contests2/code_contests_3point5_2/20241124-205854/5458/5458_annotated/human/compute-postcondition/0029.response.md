Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an input integer, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized with all elements as 0, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1. In the case where `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. For all other cases when `i` is not 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], otherwise, it is updated to the sum of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod and dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. This postcondition ensures that the program maintains the correct state of the variables after the if else block executes, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
