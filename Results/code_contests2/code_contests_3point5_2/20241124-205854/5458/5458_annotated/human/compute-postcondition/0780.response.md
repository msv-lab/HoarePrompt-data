Postcondition: ***`s`, `k+1`, `j`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. The value of `k+1` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, and `m` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with respect to mod.***
