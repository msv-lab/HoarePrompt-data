Postcondition: ***mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is at least 1, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with the value at index [1][2][k] updated, i is less than n, j is 1 and less than or equal to m, k is within the range [1, s]. If i is equal to 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is not equal to 0 and j is greater than k, the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If j is less than or equal to k, the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the modulus of the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Additionally, the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by the modulus of the value at index [i & 1][j][k - j].***
