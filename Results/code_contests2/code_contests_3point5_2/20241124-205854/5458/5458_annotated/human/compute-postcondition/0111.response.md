According to the code, the loop will execute `n^2` times. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` needs to be greater than 0.
- `m` needs to be at least 1.
- `s` should maintain its input integer value.
- `dp` should be a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values.
- `i` can be either 0 or non-zero.
- `j` should be in the range from 1 to m + 1.
- `k` should be in the range from 1 to s + 1.
- For the conditions inside the loop to be met, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should take the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be updated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 or non-zero, `j` ranges from 1 to m + 1, `k` ranges from 1 to s + 1.**
