Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is still at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) filled with updated values, `k` is incremented by 1. If i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is not 0 and j is greater than k, then the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and then incremented by the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. This ensures that the program maintains the initial conditions and updates the specific elements in the dp list accordingly, covering all possible edge cases.***
