Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 or non-zero, `j` is updated to `m + 1`, `k` is 3. After the if else block executes, the entry `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is determined based on the conditions met. If i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if i is non-zero and j is greater than k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If none of these conditions are met, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with respect to `mod` and then adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with respect to `mod`. All possible scenarios and edge cases are covered by these conditions.***
