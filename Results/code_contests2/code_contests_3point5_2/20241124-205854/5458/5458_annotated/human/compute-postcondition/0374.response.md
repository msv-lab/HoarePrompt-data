Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `j` is equal to m + 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the program state.***
