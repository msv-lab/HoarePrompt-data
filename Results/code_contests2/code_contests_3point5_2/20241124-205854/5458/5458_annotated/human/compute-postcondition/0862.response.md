According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n^2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n^2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n^2 + 1` to satisfy the loop condition.
State: **`s`, `k`, `j`, `i` is a positive integer less than `n^2 + 1`, `m` is a positive integer**
