Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned, but they are indirectly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
