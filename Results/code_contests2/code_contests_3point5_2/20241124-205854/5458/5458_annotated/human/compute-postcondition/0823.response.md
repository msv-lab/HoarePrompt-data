Postcondition: ***`s`, `k` are less than `s`, `j` are less than `m`, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1, and `k` is less than `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
