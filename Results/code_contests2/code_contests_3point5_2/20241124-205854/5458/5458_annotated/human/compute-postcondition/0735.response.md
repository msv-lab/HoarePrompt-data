According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. Since `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2**
