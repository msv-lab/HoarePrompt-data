Postcondition: ***`s`, `k`, `j` are less than `m`, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, when `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula provided. In all cases, the modulo operation is applied to the values assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, ensuring that the final value is within the constraints of the modulo.***
