Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 for the first iteration or updated for the next iterations, `j` is always 1, `k` is set to `s + 1`. After the if else block executes, the values in `dp` are updated based on the conditions. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then it is increased by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. Ensure that all edge cases involving the relationships between `m`, `n`, `s`, and the indices of `dp` are handled correctly.***
