Postcondition: ***All variables (n, m, s, dp, k, i) remain unchanged except for dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. If i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. For other cases when i is not 0, if j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If j is not greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as the modulo of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] with mod, and then it is incremented by the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] with mod.***
