Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is still at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values. `j` is incremented to the next value for the next iteration, `k` is incremented to the next value. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp` at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Additionally, if `j` is not greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod.***
