Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the initial state is not provided, the output state can be described as: `m` and `s` are integers at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, and the assignment mentioned above is made.
Output State: **`m` and `s` are integers at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, and the assignment mentioned above is made**
