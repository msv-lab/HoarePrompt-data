According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a positive integer, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, and the conditions for updating `dp` are provided. No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`s` is a positive integer, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`**
