Output State: **mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is still at least 1, s maintains its input integer value, dp continues to be a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) filled with updated values, i is non-zero, j is incremented by 1, k ranges from 1 to s, and if j is greater than k, then the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
