Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is updated according to the formula (i != 0), `j` ranges from 1 to `m`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. No other changes occur to the variables `s`, `k`, `i`, or `j` as a result of this if-else block.***
