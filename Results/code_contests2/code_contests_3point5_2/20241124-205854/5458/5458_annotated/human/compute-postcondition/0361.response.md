Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is incremented to the next value within the range (1 to s). If i == 0 and j >= k, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the 2D list `dp` is set to 1; otherwise, all elements remain unchanged. In the else part, if j is greater than k, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] becomes equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. If j is not greater than k, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod plus dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
