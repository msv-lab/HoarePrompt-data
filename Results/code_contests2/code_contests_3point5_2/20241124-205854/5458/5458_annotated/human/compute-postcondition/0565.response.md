Postcondition: ***The program variables `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` maintain their specified conditions. Additionally, after the execution of the if statement where `j >= k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. All boundary cases and edge scenarios are handled within these constraints.***
