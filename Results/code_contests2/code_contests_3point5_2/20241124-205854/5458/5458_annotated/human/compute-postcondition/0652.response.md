According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `dp` needs to be initialized with dimensions based on the values of `m` and `s`. Since `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0, `m` and `s` need to be adjusted accordingly, and `dp` needs to be properly initialized.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are adjusted accordingly, `dp` is properly initialized**
