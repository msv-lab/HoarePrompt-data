Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `k` is less than `s`, `j` are less than `m`, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1.
Output State: **`s`, `k` is less than `s`, `j` are less than `m`, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1**
