According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `k` is within the range [1, s]. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are updated accordingly, `k` is within the range [1, s]**
