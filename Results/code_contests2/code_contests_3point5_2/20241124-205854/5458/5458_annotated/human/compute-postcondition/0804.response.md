Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`s`, `k`, `j` are less than `m`, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the provided formula.**
