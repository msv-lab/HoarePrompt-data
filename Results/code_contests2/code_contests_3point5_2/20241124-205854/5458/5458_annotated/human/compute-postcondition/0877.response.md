According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `s + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`, `j` is 1, `i` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1**
