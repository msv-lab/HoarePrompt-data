Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `m` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a positive integer, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`s` is a positive integer, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
