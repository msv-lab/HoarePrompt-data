According to the loop code, the loop will execute `s` times where `s` is the initial value provided. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, `m` will remain the same.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `m`, if `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

State: **`s`, `k`, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` (with all other variables retaining their initial values)**
