According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `k` ranges from 1 to s + 1. Before the loop starts, the variables that need to be adjusted are `k` set to 1 and `s` is at least 2. 
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 or non-zero, `j` is updated to `m + 1`, `k` is 1**
