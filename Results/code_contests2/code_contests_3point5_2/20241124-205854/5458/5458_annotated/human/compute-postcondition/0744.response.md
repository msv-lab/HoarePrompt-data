According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is 2. Since `k` is 2 and less than or equal to `s`, the loop will execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3**
