Output State: 
- `s` is a positive integer.
- `k` will range from 1 to `s`.
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. 
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. 
- If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.

In cases where the loop does not execute, the variables remain unchanged.
