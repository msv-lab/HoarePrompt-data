Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `s` are integers. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that if all three variables are 0, the program exits the loop. Otherwise, the program continues execution normally without affecting any variables directly.***
