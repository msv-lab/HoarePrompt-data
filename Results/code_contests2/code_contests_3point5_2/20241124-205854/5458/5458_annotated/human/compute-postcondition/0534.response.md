Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, and `k` are integers. `k` is an integer in the range of 1 to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and added with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Ensure that `i`, `j`, and `k` stay as integers, and `k` remains within the range of 1 to `s` after the execution of the if else block. Take into consideration all possible scenarios including boundary values and edge cases for `j` and the range of `k`.***
