Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with the value at index `[1][2][k]` updated and `k` incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is set to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. In all other cases, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to hold the modulo of the original value at `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the sum of the original value at `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
