Output State: **`s`, `k+2`, `j`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the same as the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This condition holds true for all values where `k+2` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, and `m` is at least 1. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
