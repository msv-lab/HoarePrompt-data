According to the code, the loop can execute as long as s is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the value at index `[1][2][k]` of the 2D list dp has been updated, so the loop can execute. Additionally, k ranges from 1 to `s + 2`, so the loop will execute for each valid value of k. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are: `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2`.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with the value at index `[1][2][k]` updated, `i` is either 0 or not, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2**
