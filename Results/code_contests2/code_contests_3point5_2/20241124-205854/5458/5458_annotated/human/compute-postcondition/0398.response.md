Since the loop will only execute if the condition `m is at least 1` is met, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 1 for the loop to run again. At the end of the previous iteration, the variables remain the same as the initial state, so no adjustment is necessary.
State: **No adjustment needed, `m` is at least 1**
