Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is updated for the next iteration, `j` is 1, `k` is adjusted to 1, `k` takes values from 1 to `s` inclusive. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and the program continues to the next iteration. All other variables remain unchanged.***
