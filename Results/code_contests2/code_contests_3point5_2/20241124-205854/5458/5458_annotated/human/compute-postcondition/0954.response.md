According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` retain their initial values. 
To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since `k` is 2 at the end of the last iteration, it needs to be incremented by 1 to continue the loop.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` retain their initial values**
