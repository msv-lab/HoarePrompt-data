Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an input integer, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 2. If j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. This assignment reflects the updated state of the program variables after the execution of the if statement, covering all possible edge cases.***
