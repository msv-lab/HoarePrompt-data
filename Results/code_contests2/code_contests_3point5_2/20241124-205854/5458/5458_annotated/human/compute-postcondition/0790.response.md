According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s`, `k+2`, `j`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. The value of `k+2` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, and `m` is at least 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Other states remain the same.

State: **`s`, `k+3`, `j`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. The value of `k+3` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, and `m` is at least 1.**
