Postcondition: ***mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is at least 1, s is at least 1, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), j is equal to m + 1, k is equal to s + 1. After the execution of the if statement, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.***
