Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 or non-zero, `j` is updated to `m + 1`, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as the remainder of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] divided by `mod`, and then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the remainder of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] divided by `mod`.***
