Functionality: **The function `func` reads input indefinitely for positive integers `n`, `m`, and `s` until all three are 0. It updates a 2D list `dp` based on certain conditions within nested loops. The function calculates and prints a result after applying modulo operations. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
