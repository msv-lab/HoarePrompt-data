Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is 0, `j` ranges from 1 to m + 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The program variables retain their initial conditions, and after the if statement executes, the specific cell `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.***
