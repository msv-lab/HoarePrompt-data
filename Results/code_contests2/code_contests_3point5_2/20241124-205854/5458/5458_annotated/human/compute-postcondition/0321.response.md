At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

- `i` needs to be updated to the next value after the last iteration.
- `j` needs to be set back to 1 for the next iteration.
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to consider the next value.
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be assigned the value 1.
- If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be updated to the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then incremented by the modulo of the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

No other states need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **Output State: After the loop executes, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is updated to the next value, `j` is set to 1, `k` is incremented by 1**
