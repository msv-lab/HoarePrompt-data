Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 or non-zero, `j` ranges from 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is non-zero and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The postcondition considers all possible scenarios and covers the edge cases for the program variables after the execution of the if else block.***
