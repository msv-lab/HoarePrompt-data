Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is non-zero, `j` ranges from 1 to m + 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and the loop continues. The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
