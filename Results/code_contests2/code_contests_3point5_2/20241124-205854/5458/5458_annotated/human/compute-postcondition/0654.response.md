According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `n` and `m` are given to be greater than 0, they do not need adjustment. At the start of the loop, `k` takes values from 1 to `s`, so `k` needs to be initialized to 1. Therefore, the adjustments needed for the loop to execute are: `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is adjusted accordingly, `dp` is properly initialized, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
