According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is still at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, and `j` has been incremented to the next value for the next iteration.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions need to be met:

1. `j` should be less than or equal to `m` for the loop to continue.
2. Based on the conditions inside the loop:
   - If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be set to 1.
   - If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should take the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
   - In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be updated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration would be:
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is still at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `j` is within the range from 1 to `m`**
