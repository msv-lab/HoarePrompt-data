Postcondition: ***`s`, `k`, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` (with all other variables retaining their initial values). If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, otherwise it is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All other variables retain their initial values.***
