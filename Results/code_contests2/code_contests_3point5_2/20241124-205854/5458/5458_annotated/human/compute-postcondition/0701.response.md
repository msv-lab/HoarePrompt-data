According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
