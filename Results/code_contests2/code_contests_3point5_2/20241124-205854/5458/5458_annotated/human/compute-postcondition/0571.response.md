Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, the value at index [1][2][k] is updated, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1 and less than or equal to `m`, `k` is within the range [2, s + 1]. After the execution of the if-else block, the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the conditions:
- If i is 0 and j >= k, [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1.
- If i is not 0 and j > k, [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].
- If i is not 0, j is less than or equal to k, [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as (dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod) + (dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod). All possible edge cases and boundary values are accounted for within the specified constraints.***
