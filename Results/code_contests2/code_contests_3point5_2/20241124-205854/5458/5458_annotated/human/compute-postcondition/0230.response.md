Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 for the first iteration or updated for the next iterations, `j` is always 1, `k` is adjusted to 1 and takes values from 1 to `s` inclusive. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. In addition, if `j` is not greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the modulo of the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and then incremented by the modulo of the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j].***
