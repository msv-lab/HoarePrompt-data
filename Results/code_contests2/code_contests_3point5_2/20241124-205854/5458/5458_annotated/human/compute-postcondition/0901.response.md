Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` becomes 1. The values of `j` and `k` are not directly modified in this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `s`, `k`, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` (with all other variables retaining their initial values), `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`s`, `k`, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` (with all other variables retaining their initial values), `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
