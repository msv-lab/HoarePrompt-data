According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, which means the loop will not execute again. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `s` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
