Since the loop iterates over `k` in the range from 1 to s+1, the loop will always execute as long as `s` is a positive integer. Therefore, the key states that need to be adjusted are related to the conditions mentioned in the initial state description.

To ensure the loop executes, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` is set to 1, `s` is a positive integer**
