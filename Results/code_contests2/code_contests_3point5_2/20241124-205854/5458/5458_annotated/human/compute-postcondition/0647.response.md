Since the loop condition is `while 1`, it means that the loop will execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement within the loop body. Since there are no variables directly affected by this code snippet, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: No variables are directly affected by this code snippet.
