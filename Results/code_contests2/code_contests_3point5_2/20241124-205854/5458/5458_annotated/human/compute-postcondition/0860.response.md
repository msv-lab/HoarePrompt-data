According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`, `k`, `i`, `j`, and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 1, `k` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or updated according to the formula, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop ranges from 1 to `m`, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `s` is at least 1, `k` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or updated according to the formula, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`**
