Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are updated accordingly. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and all other variables retain their initial conditions. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no change in the state of the program variables. `k` remains within the range [1, s+1].***
