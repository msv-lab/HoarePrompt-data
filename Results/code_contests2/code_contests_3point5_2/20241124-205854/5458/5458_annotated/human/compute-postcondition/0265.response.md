According to the code fragment, the loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

- `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value from the current value to `s`, inclusive. So, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, `j` needs to be updated to `j + 1`.
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, which means the values of `i` and `j` need to be adjusted accordingly.
- For all other cases where `i` is not 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, the values in the `dp` list need to be updated based on the described conditions.

State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is updated for the next iterations, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is adjusted to the next value from the current value to `s`, inclusive**
