Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where the value at index `[1][2][k]` has been updated and `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is set to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues.***
