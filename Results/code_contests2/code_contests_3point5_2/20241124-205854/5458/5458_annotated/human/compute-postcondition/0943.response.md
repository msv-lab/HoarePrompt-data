Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is executed. Depending on the values of `j` and `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` retain their initial values. `i` is not equal to 0. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` may have been updated based on the calculation mentioned above.**
