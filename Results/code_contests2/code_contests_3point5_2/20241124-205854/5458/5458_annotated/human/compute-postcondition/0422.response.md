Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i+1 & 1][j+1][k]. The initial state indicates that m and s are integers at least 1, and k is less than or equal to s, but the specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: m and s are integers at least 1, k is less than or equal to s, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1.
Output State: **m and s are integers at least 1, k is less than or equal to s, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1**
