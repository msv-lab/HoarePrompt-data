Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is non-zero, `j` ranges from 1 to m + 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`. The state of other variables remains the same.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is non-zero, `j` ranges from 1 to m + 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`**
