According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of `1` to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be updated to `m + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), j is equal to m + 1**
