According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range [2, s + 1]. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is within the range [2, s + 1]. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, the value at index [1][2][k] is updated, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1 and less than or equal to `m`, `k` is within the range [2, s + 2].**
