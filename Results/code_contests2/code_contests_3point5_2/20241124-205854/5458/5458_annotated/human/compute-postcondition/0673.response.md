Example Answer: 
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the remainder of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] divided by mod if j is greater than k. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **All variables (n, m, s, dp, k, i) remain unchanged except for dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k], which is updated based on the condition mentioned.**
