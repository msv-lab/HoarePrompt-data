Postcondition: ***mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is at least 1, s is greater than 0, the value at index [1][2][k] is updated, i is less than n, j is greater than 1 and less than or equal to m, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] and dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] are updated accordingly, k is within the range [1, s] (updated to the next value). If i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to 1. If i is not 0 and j is greater than k, then the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. Otherwise, if j is not greater than k, the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is computed as the modulo of the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k] and then added to the modulo of the value at index [i & 1][j][k - j] to update the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k].***
