Postcondition: ***`s`, `k` are less than `s`, `j` are less than `m`, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1, and `k` is less than `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This assignment continues the current state of the program and maintains the specified conditions of the variables.***
