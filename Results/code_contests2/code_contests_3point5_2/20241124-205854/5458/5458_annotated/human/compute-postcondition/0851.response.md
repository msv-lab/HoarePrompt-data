Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 3, `i` is either 0 or updated according to the formula, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. This describes the overall state of the program after the if statement, ensuring the initial conditions are met and covering all possible scenarios of the execution.***
