According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` is set to 1, `s` is a positive integer**
