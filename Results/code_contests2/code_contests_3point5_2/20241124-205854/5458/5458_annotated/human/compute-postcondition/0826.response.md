According to the code, the loop executes as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, and `m` remain within the specified constraints. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the provided formula. The modulo operation is applied to the values assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to ensure they are within the constraints of the modulo. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`s`, `k`, and `m` remain within the specified constraints, `i` is either 0 or updated according to the formula, `j` is updated to the next value within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive.**
