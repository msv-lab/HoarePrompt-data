Output State: After the loop executes, `s`, `k`, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` will retain their initial values. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other scenarios, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge cases of the loop.
