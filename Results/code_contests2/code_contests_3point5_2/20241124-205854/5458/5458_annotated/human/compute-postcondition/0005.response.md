Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are input integers. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `mod`, `n`, `m`, and `s`. `dp` is initialized as a 2D list of lists with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0**
