Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 or non-zero, `j` ranges from 1 to m + 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the specific cell `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, in the non-zero case, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
