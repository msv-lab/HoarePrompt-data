Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `i`, `j`, and `k` retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` retain their initial values.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` retain their initial values**
