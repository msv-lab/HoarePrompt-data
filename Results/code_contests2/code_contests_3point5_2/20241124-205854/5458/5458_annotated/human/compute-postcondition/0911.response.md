According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s`, `k`, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` have their values updated according to the conditions mentioned. To adjust the states for the next iteration, the following changes need to be made:
1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. So, increment `j` by 1.
2. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, so increment `j` by 1.
3. All other variables retain their initial values.
State: **`s`, `k + 1`, `j`, `i`, `m`**
