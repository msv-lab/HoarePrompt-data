Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers. `k` is an integer in the range of 1 to `s`.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, and `k` are integers. `k` is an integer in the range of 1 to `s`**
