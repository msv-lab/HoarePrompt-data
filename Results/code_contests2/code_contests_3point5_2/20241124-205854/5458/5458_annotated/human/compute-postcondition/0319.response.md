According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than `m`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i`, `j` is less than `m`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `s` are integers**
