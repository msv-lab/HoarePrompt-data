According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. In this case, for the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`s`, `k`, `j` is a positive integer less than `n^2 + 1`, `i` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1**
