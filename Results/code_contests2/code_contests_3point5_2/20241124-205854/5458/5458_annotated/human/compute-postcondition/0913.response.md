Postcondition: ***`s`, `k + 1`, `j`, `i`, `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are variables. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement. This postcondition covers the scenario where `j` is equal to `k` as well as when `j` is greater than `k`.***
