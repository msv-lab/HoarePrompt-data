According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n^2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a positive integer and `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. Based on the conditions provided:
1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. To execute the loop again, `j` should be greater than or equal to `k` in the next iteration.
2. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. To execute the loop again, `j` should be greater than `k`.
3. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This condition does not affect whether the loop will execute again.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the states that need adjustment are:
State: **`s` is a positive integer, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is less than `n^2`**
