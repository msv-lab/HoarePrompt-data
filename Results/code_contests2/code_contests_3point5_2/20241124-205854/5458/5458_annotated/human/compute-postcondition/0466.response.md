Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with the value at index `[1][2][k]` updated, `i` is either 0 or not, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If neither of these conditions are met, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` added to the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
