Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, `s` is a positive integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
