Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `m` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` is either 0 or updated according to the formula, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`.
Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` is either 0 or updated according to the formula, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`**
