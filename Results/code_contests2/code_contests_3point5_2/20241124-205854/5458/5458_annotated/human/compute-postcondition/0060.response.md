Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is still at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) filled with updated values, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. All other variables retain their initial conditions.***
