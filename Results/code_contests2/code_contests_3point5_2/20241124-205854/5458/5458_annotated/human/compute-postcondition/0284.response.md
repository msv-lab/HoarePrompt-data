Output State: **If i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. For all other cases, including when i is not 0, if j is greater than k, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. In all remaining scenarios, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by taking the modulo of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] with mod and adding the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] with mod. If n is 0 or m is less than 1 or s is less than 1, the loop will not execute and the values of all variables will remain the same as the initial state.**
