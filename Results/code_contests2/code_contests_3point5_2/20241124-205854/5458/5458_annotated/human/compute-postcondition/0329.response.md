According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized with 0 values. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `i` should be set to 0.
State: **mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is still at least 1, s maintains its input integer value, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized with 0 values, i is 0**
