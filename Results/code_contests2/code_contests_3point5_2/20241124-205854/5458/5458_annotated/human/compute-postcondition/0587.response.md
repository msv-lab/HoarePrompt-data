Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, the value at index [1][2][k] is updated, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are updated accordingly, `k` is within the range [1, s]. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
