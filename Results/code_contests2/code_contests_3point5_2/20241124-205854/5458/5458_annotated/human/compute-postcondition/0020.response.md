Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an input integer, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized with all elements as 0, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, after executing the code snippet, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
