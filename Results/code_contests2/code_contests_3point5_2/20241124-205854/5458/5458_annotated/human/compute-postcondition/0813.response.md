Output State: **`s`, `k` is less than `s`, `j` are less than `m`, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
