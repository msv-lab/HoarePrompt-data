Postcondition: ***`s`, `k+2`, `j`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. The value of `k+2` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, and `m` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. For all other cases meeting the aforementioned conditions, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
