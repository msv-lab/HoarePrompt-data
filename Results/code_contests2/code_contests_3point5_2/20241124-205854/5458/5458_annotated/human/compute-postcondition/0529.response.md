Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, but the specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers, and the assignment operation described above has taken place.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, and `k` are integers, and the assignment operation has taken place**
