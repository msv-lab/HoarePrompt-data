Postcondition: ***All variables (n, m, s, dp, k, i) remain unchanged except for dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k], which is set to 1 when i equals 0 and j is greater than or equal to k. If j is greater than k in any other case, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] takes the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Following this, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is computed as the modulo of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] when j is less than or equal to k.***
