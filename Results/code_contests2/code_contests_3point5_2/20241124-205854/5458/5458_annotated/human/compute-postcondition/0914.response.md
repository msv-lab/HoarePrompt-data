Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `s`, `k + 1`, `j`, `i`, `m`. No variables are directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `k + 1`, `j`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`s`, `k + 1`, `j`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged**
