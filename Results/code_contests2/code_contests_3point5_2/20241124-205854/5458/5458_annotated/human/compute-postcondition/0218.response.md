According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `k` is adjusted to 1, and `k` can take values from 1 to `s` inclusive for the loop to execute.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is updated for the next iteration, `j` is 1, `k` is adjusted to 1, `k` takes values from 1 to `s` inclusive**
