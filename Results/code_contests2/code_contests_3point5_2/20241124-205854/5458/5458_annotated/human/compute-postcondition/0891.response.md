Postcondition: ***`s`, `k` are integers where `s` is greater than or equal to `k`. `j`, `i`, `m` have the specified initial values. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration or statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
