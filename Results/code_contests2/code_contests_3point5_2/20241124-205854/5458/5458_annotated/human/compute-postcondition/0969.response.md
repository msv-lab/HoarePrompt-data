Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, `mod` are positive integers. The loop executes based on the given conditions and updates the `dp` array accordingly. After the loop execution, the values of `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, `m` remain the same. The program then prints the modulo of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s]` with `mod`.**
