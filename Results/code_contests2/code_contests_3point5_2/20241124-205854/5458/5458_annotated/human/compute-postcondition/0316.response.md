Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `s` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod when j >= k. If `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] if `i` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod if `j` is less than or equal to `k`.***
