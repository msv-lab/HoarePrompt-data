According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` divided by `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` is incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j + 1][k - j]` divided by `mod`.**
