Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` retain their initial values. If `j` is greater than 3, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues execution. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables or the state of the program.***
