Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `k+1`, `j`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. The value of `k+1` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, and `m` is at least 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`s`, `k+1`, `j`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. The value of `k+1` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, and `m` is at least 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
