Output State: **mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is at least 1, s is greater than 0, the value at index [1][2][k] is updated, i is less than n, j is greater than 1 and less than or equal to m, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] is updated accordingly, k is updated to the next value within the range [1, s], and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by the modulo operation of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] with mod.**
