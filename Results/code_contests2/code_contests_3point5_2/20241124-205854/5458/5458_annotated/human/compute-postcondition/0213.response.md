Output State: **If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` divided by `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` is incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j + 1][k - j]` divided by `mod`. If `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the loop does not execute and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` remains unchanged.**
