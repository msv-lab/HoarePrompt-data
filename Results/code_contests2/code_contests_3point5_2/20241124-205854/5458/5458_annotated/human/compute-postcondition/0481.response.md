Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with the value at index `[1][2][k]` updated, `i` is not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2`, and the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is updated to be the sum of the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`**.
