According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, all variables retain their initial values. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is now 1.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j + 1`, `i`, `m` retain their initial values**
