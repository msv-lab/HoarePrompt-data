Postcondition: ***mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is at least 1, s is greater than 0, the value at index [1][2][k] is updated, i is less than n, j is greater than 1 and less than or equal to m, k is within the range [1, s] where dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] and dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] are updated accordingly. If j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1.***
