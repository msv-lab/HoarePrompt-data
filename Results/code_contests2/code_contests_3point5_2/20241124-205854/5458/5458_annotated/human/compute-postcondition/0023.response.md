Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an input integer, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized with all elements as 0, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1. Upon execution of the if statement where j >= k, the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. This holds true for all possible combinations of values within the specified ranges for each variable, ensuring that the program maintains its integrity and consistency under any valid input scenario.***
