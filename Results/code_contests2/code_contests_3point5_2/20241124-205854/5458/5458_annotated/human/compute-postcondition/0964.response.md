Output State: **If `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `k` will be equal to the number of iterations of the loop. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will depend on the conditions within the loop. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be calculated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All other variables will retain their initial values. If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute and all variables will remain unchanged.**
