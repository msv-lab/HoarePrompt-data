Output State: **`s` is a positive integer, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
