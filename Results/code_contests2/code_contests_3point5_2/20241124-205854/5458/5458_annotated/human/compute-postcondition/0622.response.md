According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range [1, s]. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are updated accordingly, `k` is within the range [1, s]. Based on the given conditions, for the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are updated accordingly, `k` is within the range [1, s+1]**
