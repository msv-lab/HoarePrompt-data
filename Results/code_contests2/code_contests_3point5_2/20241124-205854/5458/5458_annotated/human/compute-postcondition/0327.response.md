Postcondition: ***mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is still at least 1, s maintains its input integer value, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values based on the conditions inside the loop. If n equals m equals s equals 0, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the program variables retain their initial values and dp is updated as described.***
