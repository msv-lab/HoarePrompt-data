Postcondition: ***`m` and `s` are integers at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` >= `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` > `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `k` incremented by 1. In the case of `j >= k`, the program sets `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1. The overall postcondition ensures that the program maintains the integrity of the variables `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp`, and `mod` by following the specified conditions and incrementing `k` when necessary to handle all edge cases.***
