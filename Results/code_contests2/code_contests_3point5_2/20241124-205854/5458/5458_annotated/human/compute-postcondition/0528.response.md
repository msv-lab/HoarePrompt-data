Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, and `k` are integers. `k` is an integer in the range of 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program variables. Ensure that the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain integers and `k` falls within the range of 1 to `s` after the execution of the if statement. Consider all possible edge cases where `j` could be less than `k` or the range of `k` is not within 1 to `s`.***
