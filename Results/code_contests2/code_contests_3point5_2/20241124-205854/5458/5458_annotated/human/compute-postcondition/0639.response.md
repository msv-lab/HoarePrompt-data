Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers where `k` is less than `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
