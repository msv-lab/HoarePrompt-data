According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is at the upper limit `m`, `k` is within the range [1, s], and other conditions are met. For the loop to execute one more time, the `j` should be updated to be less than or equal to `m` and greater than 1 for the next iteration.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are updated accordingly, and `k` is within the range [1, s]**
