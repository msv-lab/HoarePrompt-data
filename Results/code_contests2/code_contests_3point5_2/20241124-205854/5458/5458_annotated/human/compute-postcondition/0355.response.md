Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is incremented to the next value within the range (1 to s). After the execution of the if statement, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the 2D list `dp` is set to 1, while all other elements remain unchanged.***
