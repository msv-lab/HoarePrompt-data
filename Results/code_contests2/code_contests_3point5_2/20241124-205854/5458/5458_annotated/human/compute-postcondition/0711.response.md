Example Answer: 
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values are `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
