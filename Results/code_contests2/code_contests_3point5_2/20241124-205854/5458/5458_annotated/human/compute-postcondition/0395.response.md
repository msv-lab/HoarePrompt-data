Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `j` is equal to m + 1, `k` is less than or equal to s. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. For all other cases when `i` is not 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. After execution, the final state of `dp` is such that dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. This postcondition covers all scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment.***
