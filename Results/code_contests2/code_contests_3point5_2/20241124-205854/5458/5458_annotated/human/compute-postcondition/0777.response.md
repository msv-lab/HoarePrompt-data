Postcondition: ***`s`, `k+1`, `j`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. The value of `k+1` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, and `m` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues without any change in the other variables. All other variables retain their initial positive integer values within the specified ranges and constraints.***
