Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 or non-zero, `j` ranges from 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. The postcondition covers all possible edge cases and scenarios after the execution of the if statement.***
