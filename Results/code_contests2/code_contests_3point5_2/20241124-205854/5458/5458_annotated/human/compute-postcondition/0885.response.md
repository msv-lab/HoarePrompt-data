Postcondition: ***`s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, `m` have the specified initial values. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is a positive integer and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula provided. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is determined by the previous values of `dp[i & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with the modulo operation applied. All variables retain their initial conditions and the relationships between them are defined according to the execution of the if-else block.***
