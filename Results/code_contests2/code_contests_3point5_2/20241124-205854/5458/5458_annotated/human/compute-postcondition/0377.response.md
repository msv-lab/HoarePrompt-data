Postcondition: ***mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is at least 1, s is at least 1, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), j is equal to m + 1, k is 1. If i is equal to 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, for i not equal to 0, if j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If j is not greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and then incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
