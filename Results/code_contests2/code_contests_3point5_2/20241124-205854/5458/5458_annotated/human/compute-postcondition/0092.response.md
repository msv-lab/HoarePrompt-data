Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The previous values of i, j, and k are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is still at least 1, s maintains its input integer value, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, j is incremented to the next value for the next iteration, k is incremented to the next value.
Output State: **mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is still at least 1, s maintains its input integer value, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, j is incremented to the next value for the next iteration, k is incremented to the next value**
