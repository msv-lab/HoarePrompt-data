Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 3, `i` is either 0 or updated according to the formula, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The state of the program variables is maintained after the execution of the if statement, covering all possible edge cases.***
