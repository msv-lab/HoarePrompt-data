Output State: **After the loop executes, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is either 0 for the first iteration or updated for the next iterations, `j` is always 1, `k` is adjusted to take values from 1 to `s` inclusive. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Else, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then incremented by the modulo of the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and all variables retain their initial values.**
