Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the variables are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `j` is equal to m + 1, `k` is less than or equal to s.
Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `j` is equal to m + 1, `k` is less than or equal to s**
