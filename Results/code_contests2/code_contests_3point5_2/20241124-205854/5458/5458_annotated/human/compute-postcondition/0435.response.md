According to the code, the loop can execute as long as m is at least 1. Therefore, the values that need to be adjusted are `i` should be set to 0, `j` should be set to 1, and `k` can remain unchanged. The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` needs to be updated.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` remains unchanged, update value at index `[1][2][k]` in `dp`**
