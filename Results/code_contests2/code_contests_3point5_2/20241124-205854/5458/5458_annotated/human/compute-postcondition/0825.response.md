Output State: **After the loop executes, the values of `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, and `m` remain within the specified constraints. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the provided formula. The modulo operation is applied to the values assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to ensure they are within the constraints of the modulo. If the loop does not execute, the variables retain their initial values.**
