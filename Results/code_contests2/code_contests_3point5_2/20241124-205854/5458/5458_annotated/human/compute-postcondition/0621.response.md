Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are updated accordingly, `k` is within the range [1, s]. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, if `j` is not greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All edge cases and scenarios within the specified ranges are covered and accounted for in the postcondition.***
