Output State: **mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is at least 1, s is at least 1, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), j is equal to m + 1, k is equal to s + 1. If j is greater than k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. All variables retain their initial conditions and the program proceeds accordingly.**
