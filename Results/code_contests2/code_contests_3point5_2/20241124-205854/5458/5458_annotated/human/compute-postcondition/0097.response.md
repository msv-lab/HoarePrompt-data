Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is still at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `j` is incremented to the next value for the next iteration, `k` is incremented to the next value. After the execution of the if statement, if j is greater than or equal to k, the value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. If j > k, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. All other variables retain their initial conditions.***
