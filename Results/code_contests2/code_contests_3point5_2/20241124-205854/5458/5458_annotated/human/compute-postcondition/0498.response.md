Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with the value at index [1][2][k + 1] updated and `k` incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] in `dp` is set to the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
