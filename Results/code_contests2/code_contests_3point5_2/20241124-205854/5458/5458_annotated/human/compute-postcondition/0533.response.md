Example Answer:
If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The states of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`i`, `j`, and `k` are integers.**
