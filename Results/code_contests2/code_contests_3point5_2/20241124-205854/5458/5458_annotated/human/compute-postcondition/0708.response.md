Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of the variables are `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Therefore, the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will depend on the values of `j`, `k`, and `s`. 
Output State: **The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `j`, `k`, and `s`.**
