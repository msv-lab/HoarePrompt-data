Example Answer: 
If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The states of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, `m` remain the same, and the changes described above are made to `dp` variables.**
