Output State: 
- After the loop executes, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers where `k` is within the range [1, s]. 
- If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. 
- If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 
- If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. 
- If `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is not within the range (2, m], then the loop does not execute and all variables retain their initial values.
