According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s`, `k + 1`, `j`, `i`, `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are variables. If the loop is to execute again, `j` should be less than `k`. After the execution of the if-else block, if `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `1`. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `k`.
State: **`s`, `k + 1`, `j + 1`, `i`, `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`**
