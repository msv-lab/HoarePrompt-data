According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. The value of `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, and `m` is at least 1. To execute the loop one more time, `k` should be incremented to the next value in the range.

State: **`s`, `k+1`, `j`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. The value of `k+1` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2`, and `m` is at least 1**
