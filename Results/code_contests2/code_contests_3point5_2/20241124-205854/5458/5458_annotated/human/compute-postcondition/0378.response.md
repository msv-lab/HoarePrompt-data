According to the code, the loop executes as long as k ranges from 1 to s (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is at least 1, s is at least 1, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), j is equal to m + 1, k is equal to s. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, k needs to be adjusted to k is equal to s + 1.
State: **mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is at least 1, s is at least 1, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), j is equal to m + 1, k is equal to s + 1**
