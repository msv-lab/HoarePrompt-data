According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range [1, m]. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are mentioned based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

- If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the remainders.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state adjustments should focus on ensuring that `j` remains within the range [1, m] and the conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are met based on the specified rules.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers where `k` is within the range [1, s] with the necessary conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` satisfied**
