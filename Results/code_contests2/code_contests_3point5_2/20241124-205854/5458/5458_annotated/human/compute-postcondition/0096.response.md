Output State: **mod remains 100000, n stays greater than 0, m is still at least 1, s maintains its input integer value, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, j is incremented to the next value for the next iteration, k is incremented to the next value. If j > k, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
