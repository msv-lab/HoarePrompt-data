According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to s. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is still at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` continues to be a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initially filled with 0s, `i` can be either 0 or non-zero, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` ranges from 1 to s**
