Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` stays greater than 0, `m` is still at least 1, `s` maintains its input integer value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) filled with updated values based on the conditions given in the if else block. When `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. In the else part, when `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the remainder of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] with mod, and then increased by the remainder of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] with mod. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment.***
