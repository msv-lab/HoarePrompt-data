Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with updated values, `i` is updated for the next iterations, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is less than `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp` at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp` at position `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, the value of `dp` at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the modulo operation of the value of `dp` at position `[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the value of `dp` at position `[i & 1][j][k - j]`, incremented by the same modulo operation.***
