Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes input for the size of the bingo card, the upper limit of the integers written in the square, and the sum of integers.
2. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of bingo cards that can be created based on the given conditions.
3. The program efficiently iterates through the possible combinations of integers in the bingo card squares and calculates the total number of valid bingo cards.
4. The final result is computed by taking the modulo of the maximum number of bingo cards with 100000.
5. The program handles multiple datasets and terminates when the input values for `n`, `m`, and `s` are all zero.
6. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem description provided.
7. Since the code covers all possible cases and the logic follows the problem requirements, the correctness of the program is true.
