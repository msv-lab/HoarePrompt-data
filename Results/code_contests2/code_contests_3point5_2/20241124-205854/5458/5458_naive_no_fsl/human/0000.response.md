Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given conditions. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid Bingo cards that can be created for each input dataset. The program iterates through all possible combinations of integers in the Bingo card squares and keeps track of the count of valid Bingo cards. The final result is the remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created divided by 100000.

The program covers all potential cases and edge conditions as specified in the problem description. It ensures that the integers are arranged in ascending order within each column and that no two cards are the same. The logic for updating the dynamic programming array is correctly implemented, taking into account the constraints on integers in each square and the sum of integers on the Bingo card.

Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and produces the correct output for all possible input datasets.
