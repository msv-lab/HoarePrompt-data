Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input values for N, M, and S until all three are 0.
- It then calculates the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the constraints provided for N, M, and S using dynamic programming.
- The code correctly iterates through the input values and updates the `dp` list based on specific conditions.
- It handles cases where S is less than 1 and where S is greater than or equal to 1 appropriately.
- The code seems to be following the problem description for all potential cases.
