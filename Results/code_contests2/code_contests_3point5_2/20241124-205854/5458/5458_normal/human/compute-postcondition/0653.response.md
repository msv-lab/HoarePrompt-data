According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to `m + 1`. Before the loop starts, `n` being greater than 0 does not impact the loop execution. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted so that `j` is set to 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged, `dp` is a 2D list filled with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) and (s + 1), `j` is 1**
