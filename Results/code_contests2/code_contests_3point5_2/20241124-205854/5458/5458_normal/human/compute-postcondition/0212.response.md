According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`, which increments from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is incremented by 1. Considering the conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, we need to adjust the states as follows:

If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Therefore, `j` needs to be greater than or equal to `k + 2` for the loop to execute again in this scenario.

If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. In this case, `j` needs to be greater than `k` for the loop to execute again in this scenario.

In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. So if none of the above conditions are met, the loop will execute again.

State: **`i`, `j`, `s` are integers. `k` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 2`, and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**.
