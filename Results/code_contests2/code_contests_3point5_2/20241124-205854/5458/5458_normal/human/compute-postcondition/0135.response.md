According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop is going through the range of 1 to `s + 1`, in the next iteration, `k` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1, `k` is incremented by 1**
