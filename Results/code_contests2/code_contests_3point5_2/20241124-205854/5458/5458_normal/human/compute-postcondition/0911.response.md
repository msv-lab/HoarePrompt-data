According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `k` is 1, it should be adjusted to 2 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`m`, `j`, `s`, `i` are positive integers where `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
