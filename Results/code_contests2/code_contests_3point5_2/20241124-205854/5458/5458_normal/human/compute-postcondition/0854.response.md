Postcondition: ***`m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program continues execution without any further changes in the variables.***
