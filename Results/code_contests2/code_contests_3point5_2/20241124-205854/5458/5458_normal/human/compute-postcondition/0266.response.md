Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i is either 0 or 1, j is an integer greater than 1, and k is 2, the assignment will be made to the corresponding index in the 3D dp array. The output state is: i is either 0 or 1, j is an integer greater than 1, k is 2, s is greater than or equal to 2, dp is updated accordingly.
Output State: **i is either 0 or 1, j is an integer greater than 1, k is 2, s is greater than or equal to 2, dp is updated accordingly**
