Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1, `k` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the element at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is updated with the value from `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the element at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is updated with the modulo of the value in `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, this value is increased by the modulo of the value in `[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
