Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is set to 1.***
