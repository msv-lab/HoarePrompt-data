Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)`, `j` is 1, `k` is less than `s`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to be the result of the modulo operation of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.**
