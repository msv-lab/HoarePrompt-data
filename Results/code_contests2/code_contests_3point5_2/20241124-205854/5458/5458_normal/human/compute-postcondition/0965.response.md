According to the code, the loop can execute if m is greater than 1 and j is within the range of 1 to m. At the end of the last iteration, m is greater than 1, j and s are at least 1, i is a positive integer, and k is in the range from 1 to s. So for the loop to execute one more time, j needs to be less than or equal to m, and all other conditions need to be maintained.
State: **If m is greater than 1, j is less than or equal to m, s is at least 1, i is a positive integer, and k is in the range from 1 to s**
