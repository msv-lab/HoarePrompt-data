Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known integers, so the result will depend on these values. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `s`, `m` are defined integers, `k` is less than `s.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `s`, `m` are defined integers, `k` is less than `s**
