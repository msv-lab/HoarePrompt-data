Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 2`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. In all other cases, no changes are made to the variables.**
