Postcondition: ***Given `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and `j` is adjusted accordingly to continue the loop execution, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, the program fragment ensures that if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This condition accounts for all edge cases where `j` is greater than `k` within the specified range.***
