Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged, `dp` is a 2D list filled with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) and (s + 1), `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is equal to 0. After the execution of the if statement, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is set to 1. The state of the program variables is consistent with the initial conditions, and the assignment of 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the only change.***
