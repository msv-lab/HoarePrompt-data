Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The value of `j` is adjusted accordingly to continue the loop execution. In the case where `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned above. Overall, the program state after the execution of the if else block ensures that `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` and the variables `i`, `j`, `k` are appropriately updated and maintained for each iteration of the loop.***
