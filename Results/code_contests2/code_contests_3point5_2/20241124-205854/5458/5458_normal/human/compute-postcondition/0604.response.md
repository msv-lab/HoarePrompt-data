Example Answer:
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. The initial values of j, k, s, m, and i are given. After execution, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the previous values. 
Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` is 5, `s`, `m`, `i` are integers, dp array is updated based on the given formula**
