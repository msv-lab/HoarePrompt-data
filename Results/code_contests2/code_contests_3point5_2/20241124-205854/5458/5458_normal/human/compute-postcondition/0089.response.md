According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows: `i` is an integer, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions provided. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `i` is 0 and `j` >= `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` must be set to 1.
2. If `i` is not 0 and `j` > `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` must be updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
3. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` must be updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then added with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Therefore, for the next iteration to occur, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions specified.**
