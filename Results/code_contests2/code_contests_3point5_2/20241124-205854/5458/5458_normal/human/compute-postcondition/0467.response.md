According to the code snippet, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s` inclusive.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s` inclusive.**
