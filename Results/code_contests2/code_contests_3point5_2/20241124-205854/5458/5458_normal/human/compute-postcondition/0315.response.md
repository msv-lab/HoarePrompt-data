Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are `i`, `j`, `s`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `i`, `j`, `s`, `m`, `k` are defined integers where `k` is less than `s + 1`, and the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the given computation and modulo operation.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `s`, `m`, `k` are defined integers where `k` is less than `s + 1`, and the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the given computation and modulo operation**
