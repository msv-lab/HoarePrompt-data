Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, and `k` is 1, the new value is assigned based on these conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp` is updated accordingly**
