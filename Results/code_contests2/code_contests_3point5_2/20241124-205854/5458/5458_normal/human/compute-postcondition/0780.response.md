Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`, and it is then increased by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`.***
