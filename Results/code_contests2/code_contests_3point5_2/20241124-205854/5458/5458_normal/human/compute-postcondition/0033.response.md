Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly mentioned, so the output state is:
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers based on user input, `dp` is updated according to the specified logic, `i` is either 0 or not, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than `s` plus 1, `s` is at least 1**
