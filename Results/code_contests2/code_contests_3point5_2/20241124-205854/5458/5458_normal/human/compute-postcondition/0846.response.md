Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. As `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The initial states of the variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, and `k` is 2**
