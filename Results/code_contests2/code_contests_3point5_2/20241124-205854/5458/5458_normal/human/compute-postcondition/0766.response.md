Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so the output state is: m is a positive integer, j is 1, s is greater than or equal to 1, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k.
Output State: **m is a positive integer, j is 1, s is greater than or equal to 1, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k**
