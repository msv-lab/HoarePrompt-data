Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `j` is 1, `k` is the next value in the range (1 to s). If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program continues without any further changes.***
