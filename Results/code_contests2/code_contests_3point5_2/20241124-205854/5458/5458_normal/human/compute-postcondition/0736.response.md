Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `i` and `j` can have any value, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `i` and `j` can have any value, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
