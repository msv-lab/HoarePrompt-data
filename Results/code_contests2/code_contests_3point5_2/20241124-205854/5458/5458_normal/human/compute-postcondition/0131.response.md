Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program continues execution without any changes to other variables. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and ensures the proper state of the program after the execution of the if else block.***
