Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k` are positive integers, and `k` is 2. The value of `i + 1 & 1` is either 0 or 1 based on the current value of `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `m`, `j`, `s`, `i` are positive integers where `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`m`, `j`, `s`, `i` are positive integers where `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
