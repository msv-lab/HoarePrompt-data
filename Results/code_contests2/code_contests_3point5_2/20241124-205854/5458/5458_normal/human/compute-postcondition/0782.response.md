Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` are not altered in this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
