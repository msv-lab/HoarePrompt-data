Postcondition: ***`dp` array is properly initialized. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `m` is greater than or equal to `s`. `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`. `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then the `dp` array is updated accordingly. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the modulo of the previous value at `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of the value at `[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
