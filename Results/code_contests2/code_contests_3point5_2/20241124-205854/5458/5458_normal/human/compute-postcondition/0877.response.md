According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 2**
