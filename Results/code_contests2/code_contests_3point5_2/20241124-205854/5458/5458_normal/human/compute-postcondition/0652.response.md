According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `s` are all 0 which means the loop will break. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0 and `dp` should be filled with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) and (s + 1).
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged, `dp` is a 2D list filled with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) and (s + 1)**
