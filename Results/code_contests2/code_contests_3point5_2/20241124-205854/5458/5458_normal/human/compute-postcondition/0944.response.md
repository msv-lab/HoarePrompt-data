Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `j` and `s` are at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and added with the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
