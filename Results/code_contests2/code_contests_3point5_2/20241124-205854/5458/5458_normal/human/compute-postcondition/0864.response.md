According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, and `k` is at least 1. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `k` needs to be updated to 1.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 1**
