Postcondition: ***`m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program execution continues as is. All variables retain their initial conditions without any changes.***
