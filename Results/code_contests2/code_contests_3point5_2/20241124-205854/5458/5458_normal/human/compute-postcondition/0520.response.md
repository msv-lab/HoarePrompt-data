Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` array is properly initialized, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is equal to the next value after the last iteration.
Output State: **`dp` array is properly initialized, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is equal to the next value after the last iteration**
