Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged. `dp` is a 2D list with initial zeros except for the element at index `[j + 1][k]` which is set to 1. `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to be the same as the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dp` and the loop continues.***
