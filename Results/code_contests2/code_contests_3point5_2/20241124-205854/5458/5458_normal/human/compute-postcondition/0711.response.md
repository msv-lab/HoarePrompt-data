Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
