Postcondition: ***`m`, `j`, `s`, `i` are positive integers where `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In the else case, if `j` is strictly greater than 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` added to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases for the given program fragment.***
