Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers based on user input, `dp` is updated as described, `i` is either 0 or not, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k` in the else part, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, where all variables retain their initial values.***
