Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` can vary, but the update is based on the current values of `dp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp` is updated according to the condition specified in the code fragment.
Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp` is updated according to the condition specified in the code fragment**
