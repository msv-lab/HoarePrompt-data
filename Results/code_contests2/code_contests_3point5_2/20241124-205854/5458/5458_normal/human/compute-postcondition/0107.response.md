According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than the maximum value of `k` encountered in the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state of `k` needs to be adjusted to `k` is less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. `s` is greater than the maximum value of `k` encountered in the last iteration. `k` is less than or equal to `s`.**
