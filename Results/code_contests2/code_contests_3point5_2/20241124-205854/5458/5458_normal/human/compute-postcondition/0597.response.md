According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j`, `k` are integers initially set to 1, `s`, `m`, `i` are integers, `dp` array is initialized, `k` is incremented by 2**
