Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The program handles all possible edge cases and updates the `dp` array accordingly.***
