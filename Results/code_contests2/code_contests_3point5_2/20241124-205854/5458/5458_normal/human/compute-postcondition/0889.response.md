Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `m`, `s`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 3.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 3**
