Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. `dp` array is updated. `j` is in the range 1 to `m`. `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no change to the `dp` array.***
