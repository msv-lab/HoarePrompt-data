Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is still greater than 0, `m` is a valid value, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is properly initialized, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is updated to be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. All other variables remain unchanged after the execution of the if block.**
