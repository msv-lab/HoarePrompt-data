Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` where `i` remains an integer, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 3, and the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 3, and the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated**
