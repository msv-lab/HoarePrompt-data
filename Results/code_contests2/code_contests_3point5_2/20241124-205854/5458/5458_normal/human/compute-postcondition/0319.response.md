According to the code and the given conditions for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the following states at the start of the next iteration:

- `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to satisfy the loop condition `j in xrange(1, m + 1)`.
- Based on the conditions provided, adjustments need to be made to satisfy the various cases for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
- If the loop executes and `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, the loop will potentially execute again.

State: **Output State: `i`, `j + 1`, `s`, `m`, and `k` are defined integers, satisfying the conditions for the loop to execute again**
