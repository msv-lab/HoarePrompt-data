According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. In the case where `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then added with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **All variables maintain their initial constraints. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is set to 1. If `j` is not greater than `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` remains unchanged. In the case where `j` is greater than `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k + 1]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k + 1] % mod` and then added with `dp[i & 1][j][k + 1 - j] % mod` where `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s + 1.
