According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` array is properly initialized, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is equal to the next value after the last iteration. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Increment the value of `k` by 1.
- Make sure that the new value of `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`dp` array is properly initialized, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `s`**
