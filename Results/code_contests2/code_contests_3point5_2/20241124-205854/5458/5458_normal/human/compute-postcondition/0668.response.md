Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Since the dimensions of `dp` are (m + 2) and (s + 1), the value is stored at index `[j + 1][k]` of the 2D list. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged, `dp` is a 2D list with a value of 1 at index `[j + 1][k]`, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged, `dp` is a 2D list with a value of 1 at index `[j + 1][k]`, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
