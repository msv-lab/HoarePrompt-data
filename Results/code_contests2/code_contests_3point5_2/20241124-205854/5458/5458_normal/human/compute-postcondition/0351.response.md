Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated by taking the modulo operation of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k - j]` in `dp` by `mod`. The initial states of the variables are as follows: `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)`, `j` is 1, `k` is less than `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)`, `j` is 1, `k` is less than `s`, and the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated based on the modulo operation described above.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)`, `j` is 1, `k` is less than `s`, and the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated accordingly**
