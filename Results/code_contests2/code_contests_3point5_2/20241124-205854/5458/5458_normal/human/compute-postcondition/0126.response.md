According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to continue iterating through the range.
- No other states need adjustment.

State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1**.
