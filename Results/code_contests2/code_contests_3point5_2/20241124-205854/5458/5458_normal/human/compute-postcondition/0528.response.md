Postcondition: ***`dp` array is properly initialized. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `m` is greater than or equal to `s`. `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`. `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is set to 1.***
