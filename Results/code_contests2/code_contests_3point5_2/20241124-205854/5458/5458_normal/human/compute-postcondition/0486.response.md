Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so the output state is: `dp` array is updated based on conditions, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2.
Output State: **`dp` array is updated based on conditions, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2**
