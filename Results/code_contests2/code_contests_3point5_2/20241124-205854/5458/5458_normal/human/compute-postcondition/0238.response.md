Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and `m.**
