According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `m`, and `s`. If `m` is greater than 0 and `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions need to be met for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1
- If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`
- If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1**
