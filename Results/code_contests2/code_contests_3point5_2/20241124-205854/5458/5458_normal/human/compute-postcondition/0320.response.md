Output State: 
- If `m` is greater than 0 and `s` is at least 1, then after the loop executes:
    - `i` is 1
    - `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
    - `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
    - `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
    - If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1
    - If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`
    - If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`
- If `m` is 0 or `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute:
    - `i` remains 1
    - `j` remains 1
    - `k` remains the initial value
    - `s` remains the initial value.
