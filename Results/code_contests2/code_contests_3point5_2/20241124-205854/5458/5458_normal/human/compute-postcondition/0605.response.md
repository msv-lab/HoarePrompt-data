Postcondition: ***`j`, `k`, `s`, `m`, `i` are integers. Initially set to 3 and 5, `dp` array is updated based on the conditions. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` added to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
