Postcondition: ***`dp` array is updated based on conditions, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is assigned the value of the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the program execution based on the given conditions and initial values.***
