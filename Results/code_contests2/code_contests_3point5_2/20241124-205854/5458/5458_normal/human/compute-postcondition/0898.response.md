According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is a positive integer. The loop will iterate from 1 to `s`. Before the loop starts, `m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, `k` are all positive integers. To ensure the loop executes, `s` should be greater than or equal to 1. Since `k` is the loop variable, it should be adjusted to 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`m`, `j`, `s`, `i` are positive integers, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
