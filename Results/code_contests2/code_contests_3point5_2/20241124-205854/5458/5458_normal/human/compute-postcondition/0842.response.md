Postcondition: ***After the if block executes, `m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 2, and a new value of 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. This holds true regardless of the specific values of `m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, and `k`, ensuring that the assignment operation is performed unconditionally.***
