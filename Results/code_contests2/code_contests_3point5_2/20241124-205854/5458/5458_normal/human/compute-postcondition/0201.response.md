Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers where `i` is still 0, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s` that is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
