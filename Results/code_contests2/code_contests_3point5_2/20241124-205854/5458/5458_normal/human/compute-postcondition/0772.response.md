According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is an integer. 

To execute the loop one more time:
1. If `k` is incremented by 1, it should still be less than or equal to `s`.
2. All other variables `m`, `j`, `s`, and `i` should remain the same as they maintain their initial characteristics and values.

State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is an integer, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**.
