Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is any value, `j` is any value, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and the loop continues. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
