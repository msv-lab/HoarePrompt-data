Output State: **If `i` is 0 and `j` is at least 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][1]` and `dp[i & 1][j][1 - j]` with modulo operations applied. If the loop doesn't execute, all variables maintain their initial conditions.**
