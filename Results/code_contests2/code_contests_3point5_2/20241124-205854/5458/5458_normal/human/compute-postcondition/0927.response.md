Output State: **`m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, `k` are positive integers, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Finally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
