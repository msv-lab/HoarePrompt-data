Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is increased by 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases, including when `i` is not 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value.***
