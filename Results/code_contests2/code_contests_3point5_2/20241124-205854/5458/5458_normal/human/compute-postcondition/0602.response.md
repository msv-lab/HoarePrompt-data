Postcondition: ***`j`, `k` are integers with `j` initially set to 1 and `k` initially set to 3. `s`, `m`, `i` are integers, `dp` array is initialized. `k` is incremented by 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. Otherwise, there is no change in the state.***
