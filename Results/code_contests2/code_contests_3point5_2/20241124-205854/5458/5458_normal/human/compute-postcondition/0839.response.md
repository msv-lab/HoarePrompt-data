Postcondition: ***`m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, in the case where `i` is not 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program execution.***
