Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1, where `i` is an integer, `j` is 1, and `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. The previous values of `m`, `s`, and other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
