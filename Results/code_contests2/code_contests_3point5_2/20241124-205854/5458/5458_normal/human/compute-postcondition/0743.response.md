Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `i` and `j` can have any value. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. Additionally, if `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the sum of the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod` and the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`.***
