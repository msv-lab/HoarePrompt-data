Output State: 
If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the `dp` array is updated such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the `dp` array is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. For cases where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In the scenario where `s` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and the `dp` array remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`dp` array is updated based on the conditions within the loop for each iteration. If `s` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and the `dp` array remains unchanged.**
