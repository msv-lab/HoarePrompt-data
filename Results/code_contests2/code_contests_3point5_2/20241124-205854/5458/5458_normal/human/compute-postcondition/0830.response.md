Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
