Output State: **`dp` array is properly initialized, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `s`. The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
