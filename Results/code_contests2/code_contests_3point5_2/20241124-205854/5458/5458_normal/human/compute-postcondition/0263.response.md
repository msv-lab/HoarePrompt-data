Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp` is updated accordingly. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` where the modulo operation is applied, and the program continues.**
