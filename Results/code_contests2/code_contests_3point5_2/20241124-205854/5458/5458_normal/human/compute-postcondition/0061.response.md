Output State: **All variables remain within their initial constraints. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and added with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The postcondition includes all possible edge cases and ensures proper handling of variables within their predefined ranges, with the condition that `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1.**
