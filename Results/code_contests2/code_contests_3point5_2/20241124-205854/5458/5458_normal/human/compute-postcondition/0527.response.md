Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The state of the other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` array is properly initialized, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `s`.
Output State: **`dp` array is properly initialized, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `s`**
