Output State: **If s is greater than or equal to 1, k is at least 1. If i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is not 0 and j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. If i is not 0 and j is not greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod plus dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. In cases where s is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and there are no changes to the variables.**
