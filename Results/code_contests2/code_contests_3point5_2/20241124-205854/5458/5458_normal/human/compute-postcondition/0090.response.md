Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values are `i` is an integer, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. After the assignment, the output state is updated to reflect the new value assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now 1**
