Postcondition: ***mod remains 100000, n is greater than 0, m is at least 1, s retains its value, dp array is updated, i is 0, j is m + 1, k is within the range of 1 to s + 1. If j is greater than or equal to k, then dp array at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.***
