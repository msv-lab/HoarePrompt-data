Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `k` is the next value in the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index `i + 1` in the alternate row of `dp` array at indices `j + 1` and `k` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the variables.***
