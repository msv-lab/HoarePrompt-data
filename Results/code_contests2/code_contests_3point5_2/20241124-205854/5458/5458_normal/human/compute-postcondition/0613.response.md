Postcondition: ***If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The value of `j` is adjusted accordingly to continue the loop execution, while `k` remains within the range of 1 to `s`.***
