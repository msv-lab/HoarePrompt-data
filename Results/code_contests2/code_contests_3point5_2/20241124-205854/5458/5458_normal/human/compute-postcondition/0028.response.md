Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers based on user input, `dp` is updated with the described logic, `i` is either 0 or not, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than `s`, `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
