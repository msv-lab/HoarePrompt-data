Output State: **`dp` array is updated based on conditions, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is assigned the value of the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
