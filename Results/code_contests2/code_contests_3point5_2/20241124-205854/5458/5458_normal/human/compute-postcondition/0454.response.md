Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. `dp` array is updated. `j` is in the range 1 to `m`. `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value in `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value in `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The loop continues without any changes to other variables.***
