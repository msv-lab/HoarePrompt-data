Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned, so their values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is incremented by 1, `s` remains the same.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is incremented by 1, `s` remains the same**
