Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration or statement in a loop. All variables maintain their initial values and relationships, with `i` being 1, `j` being greater than `k`, `k` being 1, and `s` being at least 1.***
