According to the code provided, the loop will execute based on the conditions specified for the variables `s` and `m`. 

1. If `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be updated to reflect that `s` is at least 1.
State: **`i`, `j`, `k` and `dp` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop. `s` is at least 1**

2. If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute. So, if the loop is not executed, all variables will retain their initial values.
State: **The values of all variables remain unchanged**

3. If `m` is less than 1, the loop will not execute. So, if `m` is less than 1, all variables will retain their initial values.
State: **The values of all variables remain unchanged**
