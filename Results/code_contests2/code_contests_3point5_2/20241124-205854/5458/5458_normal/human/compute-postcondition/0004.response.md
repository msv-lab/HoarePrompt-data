Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` are integers assigned new values based on user input. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `mod`, `n`, `m`, and `s` after the if else block executes.***
