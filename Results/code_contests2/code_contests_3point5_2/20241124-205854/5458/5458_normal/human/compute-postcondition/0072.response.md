Postcondition: ***All variables maintain their initial constraints. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is set to 1. If `j` is not greater than `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` remains unchanged. In the case where `j` is greater than `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k + 1]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k + 1] % mod` and then added with `dp[i & 1][j][k + 1 - j] % mod` where `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s + 1. In the case where `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
