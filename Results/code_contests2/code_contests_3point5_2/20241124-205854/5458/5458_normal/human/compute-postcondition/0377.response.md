Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` remain unchanged. `dp` is updated based on the conditions within the loop for the next iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
