Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of the variables are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` remains 100000, `n` is still greater than 0, `m` is a valid value, `s` is at least 1, `dp` has been updated with the new value, `i` is 0, `j` is updated to be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is still greater than 0, `m` is a valid value, `s` is at least 1, `dp` has been updated with the new value, `i` is 0, `j` is updated to be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
