Postcondition: ***`dp` array is updated based on conditions, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. In all other cases, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of the division of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`, and then added to the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` before taking the remainder of the sum by `mod`.***
