Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` becomes equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modular division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.***
