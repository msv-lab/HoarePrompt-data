According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `k` is 1, `s` is an integer with a value that allows the loop to execute. `i`, `j`, and `m` are not directly related to the loop execution, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run. Therefore, the states that need adjustment are:
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 0**
