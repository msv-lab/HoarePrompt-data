Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on certain conditions. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly provided, the exact values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions stated.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions stated**
