Postcondition: ***`j`, `k`, `s`, `m` are integers initially set to 1, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer, `k` is incremented by 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value at position `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All variables maintain their initial conditions, and `k` is increased by 1.***
