Postcondition: ***`dp` array is updated based on conditions, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. This action modifies the state of the `dp` array while maintaining the initial conditions of `s` being greater than or equal to 1 and `k` being 2.***
