Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1, i is not equal to 0. If j is greater than k, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. All other variables remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
