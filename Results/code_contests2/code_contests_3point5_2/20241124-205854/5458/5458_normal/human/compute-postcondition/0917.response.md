Output State: **`m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, `k` are positive integers where `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` where `mod` is not defined in the initial state. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the variables.**
