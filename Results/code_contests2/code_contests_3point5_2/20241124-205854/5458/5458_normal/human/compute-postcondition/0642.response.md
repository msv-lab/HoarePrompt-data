According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop was executed, so `j` was less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.
State: **The loop continues to update `dp` for each iteration, ensuring that `k` remains within the range of 1 to `s`. The values of `i` and `k` remain the same as the initial state. `j` is incremented by 1**
