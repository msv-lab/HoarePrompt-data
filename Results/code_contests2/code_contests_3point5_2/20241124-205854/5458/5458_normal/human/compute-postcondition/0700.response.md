Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. In all other cases where `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Subsequently, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This postcondition covers all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k` within the specified constraints, ensuring the correct state of the program variables after the execution of the if else block.***
