Postcondition: ***`j`, `k` are integers initially set to 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. The program variables maintain their initial conditions, and `k` is increased by 1.***
