Example Answer: 
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the values returned by the `map` function applied to the `int` function and `raw_input().split()`. The `raw_input().split()` function accepts input and splits it based on spaces. Since the initial state does not specify any input values, the output state after execution is: `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned new integer values based on user input.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned new integer values based on user input**
