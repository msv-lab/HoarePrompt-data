Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of variables are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 1, `j` and `s` are at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `k` is 2.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` and `s` are at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `k` is 2**
