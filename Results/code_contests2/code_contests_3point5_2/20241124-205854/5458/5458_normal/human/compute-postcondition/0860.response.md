According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, and `k` is at least 1. Since `j` is 2 and less than `m`, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, and `k` is at least 1**
