Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. The values of i, j, k, s, and m are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: i is 0, j is greater than or equal to 1, s is at least 1, m is defined, and j is greater than or equal to k.
Output State: **i is 0, j is greater than or equal to 1, s is at least 1, m is defined, and j is greater than or equal to k**
