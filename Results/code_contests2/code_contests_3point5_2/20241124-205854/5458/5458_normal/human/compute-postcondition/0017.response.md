Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers based on user input, `dp` is updated as described, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state.***
