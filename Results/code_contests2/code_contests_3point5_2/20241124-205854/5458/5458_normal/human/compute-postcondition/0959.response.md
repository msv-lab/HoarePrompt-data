Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `j` and `s` are at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
