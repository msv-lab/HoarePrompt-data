Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `j` is 1, `k` is the next value in the range (1 to s).
Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `j` is 1, `k` is the next value in the range (1 to s)**
