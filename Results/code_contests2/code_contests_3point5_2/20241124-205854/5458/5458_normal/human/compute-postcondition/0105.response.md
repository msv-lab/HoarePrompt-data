Example Answer:
If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` without any change in the other variables. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The value of `s` remains greater than the maximum value of `k` encountered in the last iteration.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the conditions mentioned above, and `s` remains greater than the maximum value of `k` in the last iteration.**
