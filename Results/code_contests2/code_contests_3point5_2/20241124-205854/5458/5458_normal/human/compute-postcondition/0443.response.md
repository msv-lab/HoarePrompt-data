Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is 1 and `i` is not equal to 0. Since `j` is greater than `k`, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
