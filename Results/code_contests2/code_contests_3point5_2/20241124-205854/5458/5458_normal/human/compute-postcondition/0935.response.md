Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The previous values of variables are not directly impacted by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: m is greater than 1, j and s are at least 1, i is a positive integer, k is 1, i is equal to 0, j is greater than or equal to k.
Output State: **m is greater than 1, j and s are at least 1, i is a positive integer, k is 1, i is equal to 0, j is greater than or equal to k**
