Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer, `i` and `j` can have any value. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is initialized to 1. In cases where `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod` and the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. If `s` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and all variables will retain their initial values.**
