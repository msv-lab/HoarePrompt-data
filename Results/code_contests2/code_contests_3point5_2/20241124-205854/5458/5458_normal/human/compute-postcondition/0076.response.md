According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to s+1. Before the loop starts, the variables `i`, `j`, and `dp` need to be adjusted based on the conditions provided in the postcondition.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than `k`, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In addition, if `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then added with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**.
