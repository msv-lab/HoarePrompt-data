Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 3. If `j > k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration. No other variables are affected.***
