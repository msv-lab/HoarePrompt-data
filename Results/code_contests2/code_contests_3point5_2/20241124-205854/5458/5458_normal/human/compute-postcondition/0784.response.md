Example Answer:
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 2, and the assignment dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] is made.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 2, and the assignment dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] is made**
