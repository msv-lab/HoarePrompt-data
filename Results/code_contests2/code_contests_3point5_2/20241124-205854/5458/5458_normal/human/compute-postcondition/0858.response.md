According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, and `k` is 3. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since the loop is iterating through `k` in the range `1` to `s + 1`, `k` should be updated to `4` to indicate that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 4**
