Example Answer:
If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not modified by the code snippet.
Output State: **No changes to `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
