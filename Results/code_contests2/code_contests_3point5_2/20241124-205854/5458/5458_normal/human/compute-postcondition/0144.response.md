According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, and `k` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1 (incremented by 1)**
