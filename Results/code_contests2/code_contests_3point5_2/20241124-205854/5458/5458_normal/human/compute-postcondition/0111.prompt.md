You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3. `n` being greater than 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students with at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students with at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: Output State: 
After the loop executes:
- `mod` remains 100000
- `n` is still greater than 0
- `m` and `s` retain their values based on user input
- `dp` is updated based on the conditions within the loop involving `i`, `j`, and `k`
- `i`, `j`, `k` are integers within their specified ranges
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`
- If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`

In cases where the loop does not execute:
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged

The loop handles the calculations and updates in the `dp` array based on the specified conditions involving `i`, `j`, and `k`, ensuring proper values are maintained throughout the loop's execution.
```
for i in xrange(n ** 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
