According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` and `k` are not mentioned in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 and `j` should still be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **After the loop executes, the `dp` array is updated based on conditions, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` is less than or equal to `m`**
