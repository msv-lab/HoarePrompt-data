Postcondition: ***The program updates the `dp` array according to the specified conditions. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` maintain their initial conditions. The loop continues iterating over the given range of `k` values.***
