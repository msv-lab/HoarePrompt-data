Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is any value, `j` is any value, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**

Note: The code snippet `continue` does not alter the state of the variables, so the output state remains the same as the initial state.
