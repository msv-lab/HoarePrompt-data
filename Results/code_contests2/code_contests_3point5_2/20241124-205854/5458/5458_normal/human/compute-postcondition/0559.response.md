Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
