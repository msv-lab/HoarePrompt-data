Based on the given code snippet, in order for the loop to execute, the values of `j`, `k`, and the `dp` array must be adjusted. Since the loop starts from 1, `j` should be set to 1. The condition for the loop execution is not explicitly given, but if we assume that `m` is the upper limit for the loop, then `m` should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `k` and the `dp` array values are not specified, but in order for the loop to start, `k` should be set to a valid value and the `dp` array should be initialized accordingly.

State: **`j` is 1, `k` is set to a valid value, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized**
