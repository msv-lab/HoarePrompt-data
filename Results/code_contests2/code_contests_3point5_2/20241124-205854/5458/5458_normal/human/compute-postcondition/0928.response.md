Postcondition: ***`m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, `k` are positive integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. In the else part, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures that the program handles all cases of the input variables `m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, and `k` as specified.***
