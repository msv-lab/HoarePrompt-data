According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. After the loop executes, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. The `dp` array is updated based on the conditions within the loop for the next iteration. So, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain the same, and the `dp` array is updated based on the conditions within the loop for the next iteration.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` remain unchanged, `dp` is updated based on the conditions within the loop for the next iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
