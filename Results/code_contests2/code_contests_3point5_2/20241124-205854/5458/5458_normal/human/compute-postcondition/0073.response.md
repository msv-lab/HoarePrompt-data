According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables maintain their initial constraints. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All variables maintain their initial constraints, `k` is incremented by 1**
