Output State: **If `s` is less than 1, the loop doesn't execute, and `dp` remains initialized with all elements as 0. If `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop executes at least once. During each iteration, the `dp` list is updated based on the conditions within the loop. After the loop finishes, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` are positive integers. The final result is printed as `print(dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod)`.**
