Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration. This ensures that the state of the program variables is maintained with the specified conditions, handling all possible edge cases where `j` is greater than `k`.***
