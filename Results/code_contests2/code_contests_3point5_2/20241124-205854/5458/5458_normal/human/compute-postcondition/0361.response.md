Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)`, `j` is 1. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases, when `i != 0`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions present in the else part of the code. Specifically, if `j > k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, it is calculated as `(dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod) + (dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod)`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and states of the variables after the execution of the if else block.***
