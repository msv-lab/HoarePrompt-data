Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, and `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then a value of 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. In any other case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions specified in the else part. Specifically, when `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if-else block.***
