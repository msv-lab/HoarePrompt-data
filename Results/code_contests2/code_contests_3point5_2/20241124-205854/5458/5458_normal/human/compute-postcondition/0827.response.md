According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, and `i` remains an integer are not directly relevant to the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, adjust the state to `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1.
State: **`m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 1**
