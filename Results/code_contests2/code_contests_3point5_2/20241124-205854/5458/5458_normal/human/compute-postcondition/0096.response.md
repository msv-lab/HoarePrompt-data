Example Answer: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of the variables are unknown, so the output state is: `i` is an integer, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated and incremented accordingly.
Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated and incremented accordingly**
