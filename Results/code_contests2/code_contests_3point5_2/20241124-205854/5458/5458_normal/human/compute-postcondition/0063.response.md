Postcondition: ***All variables maintain their initial constraints. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. In the case where `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then added with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This postcondition covers all possible edge cases and ensures the proper handling of variables within their defined ranges, with the stipulation that `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1.***
