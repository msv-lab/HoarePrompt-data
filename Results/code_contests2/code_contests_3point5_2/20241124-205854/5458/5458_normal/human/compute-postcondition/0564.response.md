Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp` are not explicitly mentioned, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, `k` is the next value in the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer.
Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` is the next value in the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer**
