Based on the given conditions within the loop and the fact that `s` is greater than or equal to 1, we can determine the following adjustments to the states:

- If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be set to 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 0 and `j` should be adjusted to a value greater than or equal to `k`.
- If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. This adjustment requires `j` to be greater than `k`.
- Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This adjustment requires `j` to be less than or equal to `k`.

Therefore, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged, `dp` array is updated based on the loop conditions**.
