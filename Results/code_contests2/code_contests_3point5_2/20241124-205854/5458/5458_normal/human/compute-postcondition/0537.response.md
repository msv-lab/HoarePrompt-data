According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `s`, and `m`. If `j` is incremented by 1 and is still less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1 and was less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp` array is properly initialized, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j` is incremented by 2 and is less than or equal to `m`**
