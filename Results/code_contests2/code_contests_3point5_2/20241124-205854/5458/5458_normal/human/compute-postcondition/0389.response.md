Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` remain unchanged. The array `dp` is updated following the if condition where `k` is incremented by 1 and set to 1 at the specified indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. This update occurs if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. No changes are made to `dp` or any other variables if `j` is less than `k`.***
