Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In the case where `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Subsequently, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If none of the conditions are met, there are no changes to the variables.***
