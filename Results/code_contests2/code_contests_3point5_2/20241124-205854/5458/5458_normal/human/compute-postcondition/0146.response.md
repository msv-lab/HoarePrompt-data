According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `m + 1`.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1**.
