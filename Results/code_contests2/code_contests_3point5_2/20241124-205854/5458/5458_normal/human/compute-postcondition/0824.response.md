According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` has been increased by 2. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is increased by 3**
