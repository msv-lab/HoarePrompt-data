According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `s` being assigned values from input does not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` retain their original values, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)` initialized with all elements as 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `s` retain their original values, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)` initialized with all elements as 0**
