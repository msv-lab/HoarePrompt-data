Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `j` and `s` are at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `k` is 2. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If none of these conditions are met, no changes are made to the variables.***
