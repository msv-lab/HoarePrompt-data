According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i`, `j`, `k` are integers.
- The condition `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1` is maintained throughout.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` needs to be incremented to continue the loop.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers**
