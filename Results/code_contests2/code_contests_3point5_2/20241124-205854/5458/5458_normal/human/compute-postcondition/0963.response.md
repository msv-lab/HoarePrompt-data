According to the code logic, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s`. Since `k` is currently the next value after the previous iteration, it needs to be incremented to the next value in the range to continue the loop.
State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` and `s` are at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, and `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s` + 1**
