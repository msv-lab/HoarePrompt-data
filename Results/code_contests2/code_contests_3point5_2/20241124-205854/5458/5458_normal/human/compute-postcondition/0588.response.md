According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` and `k` are integers initially set to 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and the rest of the states remain the same.
State: **`j`, `k` are integers initially set to 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer, `k` is incremented by 1**
