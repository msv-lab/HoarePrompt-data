Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)`, `j` is 1, `k` is less than `s`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` in `dp`. If `i != 0` and `j <= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` in `dp`. Additionally, in the latter case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the modulo of the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` in `dp`.***
