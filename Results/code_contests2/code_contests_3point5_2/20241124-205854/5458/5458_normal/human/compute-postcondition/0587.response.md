Postcondition: ***`j`, `k` are integers initially set to 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The overall state of the program after the if else block executes covers all edge cases and summarizes the relationships between the variables and their updated values.***
