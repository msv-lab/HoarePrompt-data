Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is increased by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues without any change in state. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
