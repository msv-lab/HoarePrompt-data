Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the dp array at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Moreover, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of dividing `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.***
