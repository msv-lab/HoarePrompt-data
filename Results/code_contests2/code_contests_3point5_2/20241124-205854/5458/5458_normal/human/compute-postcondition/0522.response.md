Postcondition: ***`dp` array is properly initialized. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `m` is greater than or equal to `s`. `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`. `k` is equal to the next value after the last iteration. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. All other variables remain unchanged.***
