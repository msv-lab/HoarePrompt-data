Postcondition: ***`dp` array is updated based on conditions, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, for all cases where `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod` and then increased by the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod` for all other cases.***
