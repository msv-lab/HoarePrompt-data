Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)` where the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0. The if statement updates `dp` based on the condition `j >= k`.***
