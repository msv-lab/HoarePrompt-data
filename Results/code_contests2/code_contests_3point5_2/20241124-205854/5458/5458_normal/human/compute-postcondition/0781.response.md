According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, and `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 2**
