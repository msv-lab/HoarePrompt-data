Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, but `j` is always greater than or equal to `k`. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated accordingly, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated accordingly, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
