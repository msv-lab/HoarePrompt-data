According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` ranges from 1 to `m` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `m` is a positive integer, so it satisfies the condition. Additionally, `j` starts at 1, so it needs to be adjusted to 1. 
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is at least 1**
