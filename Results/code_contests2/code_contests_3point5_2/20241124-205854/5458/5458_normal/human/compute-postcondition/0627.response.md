Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned, incorporating the modulo operation. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` are adjusted accordingly to maintain the loop execution, ensuring that `k` stays within the range of 1 to `s`. Overall, the program state after the if else block execution guarantees the appropriate handling of edge cases and the proper update of variables for each iteration of the loop. `k` remains within the range of 1 to `s`.***
