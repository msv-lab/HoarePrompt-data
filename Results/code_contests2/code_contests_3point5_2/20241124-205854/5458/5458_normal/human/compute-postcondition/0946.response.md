Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 1, `j` and `s` are at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` and `s` are at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
