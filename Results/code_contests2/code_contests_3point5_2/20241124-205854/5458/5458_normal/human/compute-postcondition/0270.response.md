Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp` is updated according to the condition. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. This postcondition covers all possible cases with the given initial values and the logic in the program fragment.***
