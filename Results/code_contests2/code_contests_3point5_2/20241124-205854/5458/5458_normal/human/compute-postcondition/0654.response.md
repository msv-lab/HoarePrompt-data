According to the code, the loop will execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0 does not ensure the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, for the loop to execute, `k` needs to be set to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged, `dp` is a 2D list filled with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) and (s + 1), `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
