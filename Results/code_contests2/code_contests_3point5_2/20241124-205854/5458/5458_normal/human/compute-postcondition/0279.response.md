Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp` is updated accordingly. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program execution continues without changing the other variables.***
