Output State: 
- After the loop executes:
    - `mod` remains 100000
    - `n` is still greater than 0
    - `m` and `s` retain their values based on user input
    - `dp` is updated based on the conditions within the loop involving `i`, `j`, and `k`
    - `i`, `j`, `k` are integers within their specified ranges
    - If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1
    - If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`
    - If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`

- In cases where the loop does not execute:
    - If `i` is 0 and `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged
    - If `i` is not 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged

- If `s` is at least 1, after the loop executes:
    - `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers.
    - If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
    - If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` becomes equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
    - If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modular division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.

- If `s` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and:
    - `i`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged.

- If `m` is greater than 0 and `s` is at least 1, then after the loop executes:
    - `i` is 1
    - `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
    - `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
    - `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
    - If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1
    - If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`
    - If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`

- If `m` is 0 or `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute:
    - `i` remains 1
    - `j` remains 1
    - `k` remains the initial value
    - `s` remains the initial value.
