According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `m` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 0**
