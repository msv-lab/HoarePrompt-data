Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp` is updated accordingly. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
