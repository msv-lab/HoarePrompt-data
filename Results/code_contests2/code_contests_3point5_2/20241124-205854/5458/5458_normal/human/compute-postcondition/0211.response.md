Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `s` are integers. `k` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
