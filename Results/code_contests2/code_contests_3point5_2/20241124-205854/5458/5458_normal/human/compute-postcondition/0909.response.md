Output State: **`m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, `k` are positive integers. `k` is 1. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
