Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `i`, `j`, or `dp`, so the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2**
