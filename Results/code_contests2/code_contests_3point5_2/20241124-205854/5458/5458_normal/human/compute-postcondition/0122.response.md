Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated according to the condition in the if part, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues.***
