Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 1, greater than `k`, and 1 respectively. As the right-hand side value is the same as the left-hand side value, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 0**
