Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of variables are as follows: `j` is 1, `k` is 3 (incremented by 2), `s`, `m`, `i` are integers, and `dp` array is initialized. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `s`, `m`, `i` are integers, `dp` array is initialized.
Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` is 3, `s`, `m`, `i` are integers, `dp` array is initialized**
