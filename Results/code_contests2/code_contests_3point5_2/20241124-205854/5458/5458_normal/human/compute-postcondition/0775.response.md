Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, and `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, and `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**
