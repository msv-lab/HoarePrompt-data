Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at position (i + 1 & 1, j + 1, k) in the dp array is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k` in the else part, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
