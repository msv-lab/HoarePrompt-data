Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `j`, `s` is at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
