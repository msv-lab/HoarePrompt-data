According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is either 0 or incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1, and `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs adjustment as follows:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to progress to the next iteration.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is either 0 or incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1 (k + 1)**
