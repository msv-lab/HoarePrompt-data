According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m` and `s`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for updating the elements in the dp list are based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` which are not provided in the previous iteration state. We can assume that at the start of the loop, `i`, `j`, and `k` are initialized to 0. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `s` to be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **The loop executes at least once if `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
