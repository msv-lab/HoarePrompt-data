Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` remain unchanged. `dp` is updated based on the conditions within the loop for the next iteration. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables or `dp`.***
