Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, where `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is unknown, and `k` is 2. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
