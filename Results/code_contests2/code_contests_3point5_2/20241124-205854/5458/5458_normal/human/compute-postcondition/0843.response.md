Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the variables are not altered. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, and `k` is 2.
Output State: **`m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, and `k` is 2**
