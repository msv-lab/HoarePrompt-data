Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of i is 0, so i + 1 is 1. Since the bitwise AND operation of 1 and 1 is 1, the index becomes `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. The value of j is 1, so j + 1 is 2. The value of k is not provided, so it remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value 1**
