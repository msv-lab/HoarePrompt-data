Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `k` is the next value in the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index `i + 1` in the alternate row of `dp` array at indices `j + 1` and `k` is set to 1.***
