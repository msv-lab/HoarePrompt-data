According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, and `k` is 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1 so that it is less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer, and `k` is 2**
