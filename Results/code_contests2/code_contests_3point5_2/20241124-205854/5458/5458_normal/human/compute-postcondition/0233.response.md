Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 0. If `j >= k`, then the element at position (i + 1 & 1, j + 1, k) in the dp array is set to 1. All variables retain their initial conditions before the execution of the program fragment.***
