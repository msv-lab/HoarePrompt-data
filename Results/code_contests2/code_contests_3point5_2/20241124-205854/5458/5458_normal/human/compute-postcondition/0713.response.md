Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly defined in the code snippet, so their values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3**
