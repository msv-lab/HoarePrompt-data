Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated according to the code snippet, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues.**
