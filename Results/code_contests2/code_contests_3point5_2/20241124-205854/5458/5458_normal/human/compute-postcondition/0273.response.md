Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp` is updated accordingly. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] takes the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], otherwise dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the modulo of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] if `j` is greater than `k`. If the conditions are not met, the values in dp remain unchanged.***
