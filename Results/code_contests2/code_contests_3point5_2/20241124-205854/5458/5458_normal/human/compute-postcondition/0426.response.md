Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1` remain unchanged. The `dp` array is updated as follows: if `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This update ensures that the `dp` array is correctly modified based on the condition and maintains the integrity of the program variables.***
