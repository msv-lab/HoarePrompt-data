According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 2. Since `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k` is 3.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 3**
