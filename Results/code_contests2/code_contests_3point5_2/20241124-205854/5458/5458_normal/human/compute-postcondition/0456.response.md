Example Answer:
The value in `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value in `dp` at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged, and `dp` array is updated as described.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. `dp` array is updated as described**
