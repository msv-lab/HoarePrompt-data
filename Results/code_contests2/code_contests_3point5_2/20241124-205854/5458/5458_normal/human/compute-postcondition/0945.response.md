According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 1, `j` and `s` are at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` and `s` are at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `k` is 2**
