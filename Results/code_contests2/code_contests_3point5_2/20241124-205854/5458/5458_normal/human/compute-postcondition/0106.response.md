Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. `s` is greater than the maximum value of `k` encountered in the last iteration. After the execution of the if-else block, the program variables maintain their relationships as described in the precondition, with the specified updates and calculations applied based on the conditions outlined. All edge cases including when `i` is 0 or not 0, `j` is greater, equal, or less than `k`, have been considered and the corresponding changes have been made to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` accordingly. The overall state of the program reflects the accurate computation and adjustment of values based on the conditions provided in the if-else logic.***
