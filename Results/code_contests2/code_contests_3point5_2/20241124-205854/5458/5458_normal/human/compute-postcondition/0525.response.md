Postcondition: ***`dp` array is properly initialized, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is equal to the next value after the last iteration. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on previous calculations. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is reassigned based on the modulo operation and addition of specific values from the `dp` array.***
