Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged, `dp` is a 2D list filled with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) and (s + 1), `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
