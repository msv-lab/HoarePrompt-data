Postcondition: ***`dp` array is properly initialized, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is equal to the next value after the last iteration. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. This condition covers all possible edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the if statement executes.***
