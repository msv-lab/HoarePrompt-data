According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer. To execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer.**
