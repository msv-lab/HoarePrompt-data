Example Answer:
The code assigns the value of 1 to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i is either 0 or not, j is at least 1, and k is less than s, the affected variable dp is updated accordingly. The previous values of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m and s are integers based on user input, dp is updated as described, i is either 0 or not, j is at least 1, k is less than s, s is at least 1.
Output State: **mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m and s are integers based on user input, dp is updated as described, i is either 0 or not, j is at least 1, k is less than s, s is at least 1**
