Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged. `dp` is a 2D list with initial zeros except for the element at index `[j + 1][k]` which is set to 1. After the execution of the if statement where j >= k, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to 1 while all other elements in `dp` remain unchanged. The values of `j`, `k`, and `s` are maintained as described in the precondition. The program handles the case where `j` is greater than or equal to `k` by updating the specific element in `dp` accordingly.***
