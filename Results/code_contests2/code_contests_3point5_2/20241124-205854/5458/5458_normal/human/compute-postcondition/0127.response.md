Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1, where `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `k` remains the same. The previous states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1**
