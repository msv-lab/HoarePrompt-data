According to the code, the loop can execute if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 2, satisfying the condition for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp` is updated accordingly**
