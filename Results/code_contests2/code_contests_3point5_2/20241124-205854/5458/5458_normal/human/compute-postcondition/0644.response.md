According to the code, the loop can execute `n^2` times. At the end of the last iteration, the loop updated the values of `j`, `k`, and the `dp` array based on the conditions specified. If the loop is to execute one more time, the index `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The loop updates the values of `j`, `k`, and the `dp` array based on the conditions specified. If the loop does not execute, the variables retain their initial values, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
