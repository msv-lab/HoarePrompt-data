Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This assignment is based on the conditions within the loop for the next iteration. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. As a result, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` remain unchanged, `dp` is updated based on the conditions within the loop for the next iteration, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` remain unchanged, `dp` is updated based on the conditions within the loop for the next iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `j` is greater than `k`**
