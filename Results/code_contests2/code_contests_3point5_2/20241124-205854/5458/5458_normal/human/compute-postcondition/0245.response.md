Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 0. If `j` is larger than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
