Output State: **If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of the values at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The loop will execute at least once if `s` is at least 1. If `s` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and the state of variables remains the same as the initial state.**
