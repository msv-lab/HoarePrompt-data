Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged. `dp` is a 2D list with initial zeros except for the element at index `[j + 1][k]` which is set to 1. After the execution of the if statement, if `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the remainder of `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of `[i & 1][j][k - j]`. All other elements in `dp` remain unchanged. The values of `j`, `k`, and `s` are maintained as specified in the precondition. The program correctly handles the edge cases related to the conditions and updates the elements in `dp` accordingly.***
