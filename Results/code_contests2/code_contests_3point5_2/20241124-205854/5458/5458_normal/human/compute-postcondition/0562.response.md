Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as the sum of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
