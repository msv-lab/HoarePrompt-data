Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `mod`, and then incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and `mod`.***
