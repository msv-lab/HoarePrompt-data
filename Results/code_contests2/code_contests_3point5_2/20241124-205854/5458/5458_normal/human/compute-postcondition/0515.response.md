Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Then, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of variables are not explicitly given, so the output state is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated and incremented accordingly.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated and incremented accordingly**
