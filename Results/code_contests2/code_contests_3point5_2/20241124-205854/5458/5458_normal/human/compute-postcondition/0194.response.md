According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers with `i` equal to 0, and `j`, `k`, `s` are at least 1. The conditions state that if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on certain calculations. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `s` is at least 1**
