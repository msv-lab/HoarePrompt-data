Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` and `j` can have any value.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` and `j` can have any value**
