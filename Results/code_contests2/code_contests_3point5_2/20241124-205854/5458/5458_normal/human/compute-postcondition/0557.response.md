Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the variables are not provided, so the output state is: `j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer.
Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer**
