Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The `dp` array is updated based on the conditions in the program fragment. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo `mod`. Finally, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
