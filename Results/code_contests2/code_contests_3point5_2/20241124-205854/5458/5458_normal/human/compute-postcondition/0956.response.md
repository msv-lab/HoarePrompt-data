Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `j` and `s` are at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. This assignment holds true for all possible combinations of `m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, and `k`, ensuring that the condition `j >= k` triggers the update of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1.***
