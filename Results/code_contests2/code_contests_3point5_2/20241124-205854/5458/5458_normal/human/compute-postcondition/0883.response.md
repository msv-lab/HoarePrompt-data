Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, otherwise no change occurs. After executing the code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
