Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. The values of i, j, and k are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` and `j` can have any value, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` and `j` can have any value, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1**
