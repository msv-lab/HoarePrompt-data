According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 1, `j` and `s` are at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `k` is 2. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be updated to the next value in the range. 
State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` and `s` are at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`**
