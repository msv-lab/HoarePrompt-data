According to the code, the loop will execute if `s` is greater than or equal to 1. At the end of the last iteration, if the loop is to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

1. If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, so the condition for `s` needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
2. Since the loop is iterating over `j`, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to continue the iteration. The value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration will depend on the conditions within the loop body, so it needs to be updated accordingly.
3. No other states need to be adjusted unless explicitly mentioned in the loop body.

State: **The `dp` array is updated based on the conditions provided, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `j` is adjusted to continue the iteration**
