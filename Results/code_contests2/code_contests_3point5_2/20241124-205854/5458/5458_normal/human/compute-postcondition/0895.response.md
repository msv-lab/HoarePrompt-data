According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, `k` are positive integers. The conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. So if this condition is met, `j` should be adjusted accordingly.
2. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. So if this condition is met, `j` should be adjusted accordingly.
3. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. So if this condition is met, `j` and `k` should be adjusted accordingly.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, `k` are positive integers. Adjust `j` and `k` based on the conditions specified above.**
