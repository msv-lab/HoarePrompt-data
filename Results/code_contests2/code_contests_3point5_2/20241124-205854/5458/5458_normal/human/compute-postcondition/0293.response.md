Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of variables are `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, and `m` is defined. The value of `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`. The calculation does not alter the state of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `m` is defined, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `m` is defined, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
