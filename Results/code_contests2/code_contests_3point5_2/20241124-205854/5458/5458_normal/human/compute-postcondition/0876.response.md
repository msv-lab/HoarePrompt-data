Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
