Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. The variables `i`, `j`, and `s` retain their initial values, and `k` is incremented by 1. This condition covers all edge cases where `j` is greater than `k` and ensures the proper assignment of values in the program.***
