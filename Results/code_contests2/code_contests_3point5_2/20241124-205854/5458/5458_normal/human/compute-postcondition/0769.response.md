Output State: **m is a positive integer, j is 1, s is greater than or equal to 1, i is not equal to 0. If j is greater than k, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program continues execution without altering the other variables. If the condition j > k is not met, the program does not modify any variables and continues execution.**
