According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp` is updated accordingly based on the conditions mentioned. 

To execute the loop one more time:
1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` must be set to 1.
2. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` must be updated to the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` must be incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Therefore, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp` is updated accordingly**.
