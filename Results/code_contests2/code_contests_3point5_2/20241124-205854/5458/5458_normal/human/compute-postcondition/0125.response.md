Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
