Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and `m` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 0**
