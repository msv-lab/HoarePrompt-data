Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is either 0 or incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp array at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Additionally, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as the sum of the values at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo `mod`.***
