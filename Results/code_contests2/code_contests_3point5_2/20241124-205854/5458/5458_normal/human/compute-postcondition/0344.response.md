According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)`, `j` is 1, `k` is equal to `s`. Since `k` is currently equal to `s`, it needs to be adjusted to be less than `s` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)`, `j` is 1, `k` is less than `s`**
