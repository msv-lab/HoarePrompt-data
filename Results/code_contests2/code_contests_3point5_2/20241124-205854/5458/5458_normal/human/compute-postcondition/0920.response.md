According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m`, `j`, `s`, `i` are positive integers where `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In the else case, if `j` is strictly greater than 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state of `k` needs to be adjusted to `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1` to ensure that the condition for the loop is still met after the next iteration.
State: **`m`, `j`, `s`, `i` are positive integers where `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**
