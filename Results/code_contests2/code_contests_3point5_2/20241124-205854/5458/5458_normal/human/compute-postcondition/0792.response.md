According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m` and `s`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` remains a positive integer, `j` remains 1, `s` is still greater than or equal to 1, and `i` remains an integer. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, it does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it remains unchanged. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`m` remains a positive integer, `j` remains 1, `s` is still greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer**
