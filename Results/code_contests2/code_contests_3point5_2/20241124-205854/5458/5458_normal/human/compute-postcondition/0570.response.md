Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` is the next value in the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and the loop continues. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
