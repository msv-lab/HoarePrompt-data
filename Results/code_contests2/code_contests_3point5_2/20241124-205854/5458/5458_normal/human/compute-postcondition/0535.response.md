According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` array is properly initialized. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and still be less than or equal to `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` array is properly initialized. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `m` is greater than or equal to `s`. `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`. `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `s + 1**.
