According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The `dp` array is updated based on the conditions in the program fragment. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than `s`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, `k` is less than `s**`
