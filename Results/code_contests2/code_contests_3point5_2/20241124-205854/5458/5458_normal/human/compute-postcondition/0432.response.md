According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` array is updated based on the conditions within the loop, and if `s` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `m+1`, and `s` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`dp` array is updated, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, `s` is greater than 0**
