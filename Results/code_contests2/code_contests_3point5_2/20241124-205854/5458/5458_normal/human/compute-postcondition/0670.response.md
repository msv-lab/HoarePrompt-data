Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i, j, k` are not mentioned in the initial state, so their values are unknown. The dimensions of `dp` are increased by 1 in the first dimension and `j` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged, `dp` is a 2D list filled with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) and (s + 1), `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged, `dp` is a 2D list filled with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) and (s + 1), `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
