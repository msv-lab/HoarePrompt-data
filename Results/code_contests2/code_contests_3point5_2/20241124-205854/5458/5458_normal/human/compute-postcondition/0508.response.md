Postcondition: ***`dp` array is properly initialized, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array. This assignment covers all cases where the conditions are met, ensuring the proper state of the program after the if statement has executed.***
