According to the code, the loop execution depends on the condition that `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers satisfying the conditions mentioned. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted accordingly to continue the loop execution. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers satisfying the conditions mentioned, with the adjustment made to the value of `j`**
