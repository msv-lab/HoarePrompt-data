Postcondition: ***The `dp` array is modified based on certain conditions. The values of `s`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. All other variables retain their initial values and relationships.***
