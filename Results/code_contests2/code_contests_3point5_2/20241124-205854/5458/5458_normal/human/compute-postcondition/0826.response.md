According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` remains a positive integer, `j` remains 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`m` remains a positive integer, `j` is 2, `s` remains greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains an integer**
