Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers based on user input, `dp` is initialized as described, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
