According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged, `dp` is a 2D list filled with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) and (s + 1), `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged, `dp` is a 2D list filled with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) and (s + 1), `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
