According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` array is updated based on conditions, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, as long as it is still less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`dp` array is updated based on conditions, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3**
