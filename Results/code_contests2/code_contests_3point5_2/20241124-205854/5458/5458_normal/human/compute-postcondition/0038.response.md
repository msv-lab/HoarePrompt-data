Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers based on user input, `dp` is updated according to the specified logic, `i` is either 0 or not, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than `s` plus 1, `s` is at least 1. After the execution of the if else block, the program variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is strictly greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. For other cases where `j` is not strictly greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod` and adding it to the previous value. This postcondition ensures the correct behavior of the program and covers all possible edge cases.***
