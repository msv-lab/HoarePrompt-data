Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `s` until all three are 0. Then, it calculates a value based on the constraints provided for `n`, `m`, and `s` using dynamic programming. The final result is printed as the output. The function iterates through the input values and updates the `dp` list accordingly based on specific conditions. If `s` is less than 1, the loop doesn't execute, and `dp` remains initialized with all elements as 0. If `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop executes at least once. After the loop finishes, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` are positive integers.**
