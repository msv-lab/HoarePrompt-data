According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i`, `j`, `s`, `m` are defined integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on specific calculations. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`i`, `j`, `s`, `m` are defined integers, `k` is less than `s`**.
