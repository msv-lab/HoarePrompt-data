Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `s`, `m`, `k` are defined integers where `k` is less than `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is then computed as the sum of the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This encompasses all possible scenarios and edge cases of the given program fragment.***
