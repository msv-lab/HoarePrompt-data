Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the `dp` array is updated based on this assignment.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged. The `dp` array is updated based on the condition within the loop.**
