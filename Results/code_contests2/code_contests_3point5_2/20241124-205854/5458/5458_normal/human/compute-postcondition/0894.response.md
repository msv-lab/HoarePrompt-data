Postcondition: ***`m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, `k` are positive integers. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In the case where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
