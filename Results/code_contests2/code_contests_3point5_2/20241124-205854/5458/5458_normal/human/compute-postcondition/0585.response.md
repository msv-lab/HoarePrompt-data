Output State: **`j` and `k` are integers with `j` initially set to 1 and `k` initially set to 1. `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer that is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
