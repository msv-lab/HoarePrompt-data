According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, and `k` is increased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than `s+1`, so `k` should be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is increased by 2**
