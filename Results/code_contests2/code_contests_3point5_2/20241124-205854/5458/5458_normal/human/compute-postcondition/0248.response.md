Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the equation dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], dp[i & 1][j][k - j], and mod to calculate the final value.***
