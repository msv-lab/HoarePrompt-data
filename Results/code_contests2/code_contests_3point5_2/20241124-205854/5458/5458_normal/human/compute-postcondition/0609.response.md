According to the code, the loop executes as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, the loop will execute for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. Since the loop is dependent on `k`, the states need to be adjusted so that `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`.

State: **If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. `j` is adjusted accordingly to continue the loop execution, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s`.
