Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers based on user input, `dp` is updated according to the specified logic, `i` is either 0 or not, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than `s` plus 1, `s` is at least 1. After the execution of the if statement, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. All conditions hold true for the program variables with specific values, ensuring the correct behavior of the program.***
