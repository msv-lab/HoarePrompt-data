According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. `dp` array is updated. `j` is in the range 1 to `m`, and `k` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
- If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array should be set to 1.
- If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there should be no change to the `dp` array.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. `dp` array is updated. `j` is in the range 1 to `m`. `k` is 1**
