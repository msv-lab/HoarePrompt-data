According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive). The variables `j`, `m`, and `dp` array initialization do not affect the loop execution. 
To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `k` should be set to a value within the range of 1 to s (inclusive). 
State: **`j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized**
