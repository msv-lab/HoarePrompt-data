Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and it is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The condition `k` being less than `s` is preserved throughout the execution of the program fragment.***
