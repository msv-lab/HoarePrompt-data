According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to be ensured that `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. Additionally, the states `i` and `j` can have any value, but the conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` need to be considered. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`, `i` and `j` can have any value satisfying the given conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.**
