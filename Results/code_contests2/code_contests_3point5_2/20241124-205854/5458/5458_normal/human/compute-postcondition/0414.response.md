Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged. The `dp` array is updated after the if statement such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. This condition holds true regardless of the values of `j` and `k`, ensuring that the state of the variables and the `dp` array are maintained after the execution of the if statement.***
