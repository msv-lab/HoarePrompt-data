Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` and `j` can have any value. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In the case where `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Furthermore, the final state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the result of applying the modulo operation with `mod` on the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
