According to the provided code snippet, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k+1` remain unchanged. The `dp` array is updated based on different conditions within the loop. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, we need to increment `k` by 1 to allow for one more iteration of the loop.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1` remain unchanged. `k` is adjusted to `k+1`.**
