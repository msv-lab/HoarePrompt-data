According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` should be updated to the next value in the range 1 to `s` (inclusive). No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`j` is 1, `k` is the next value in the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive), `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer**
