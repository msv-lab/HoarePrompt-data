Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of the division of the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` remain unchanged. The array `dp` is updated according to the specified formula**
