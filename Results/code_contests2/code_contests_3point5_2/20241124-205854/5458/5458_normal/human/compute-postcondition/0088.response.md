Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions stated. If `i` is 0 and `j` >= `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` > `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then added with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The condition `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1` is maintained throughout.***
