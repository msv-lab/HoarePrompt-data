According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer, `i` and `j` can have any value. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, update `j` to `j + 1`.
2. Reevaluate the conditions for initializing, updating, or calculating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the new values of `i` and `j`.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer, updated `j`, updated values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the new `i` and `j`**
