Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `j` is 1, `k` is the next value in the range (1 to s), dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
