According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. Before the loop starts, `j` remains 1, `m` is greater than 0, the `dp` array is initialized, and `i` is an integer. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `k` needs to be set to 1 and `s` should be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer**
