Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The value of `i` remains the same, while the value of `j` is incremented by 1. The value of `k` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `k` are integers satisfying the conditions mentioned, `j` is adjusted by 1.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers satisfying the conditions mentioned, `j` is adjusted by 1**
