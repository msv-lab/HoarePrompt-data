Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, but `k` is increased by 2. Hence, the output state is: `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, and `k` is increased by 2.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is increased by 2**
