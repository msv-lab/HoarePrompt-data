According to the code, the loop can execute if s is greater than or equal to 1. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, s should be greater than or equal to 1, k is now 1, i is any value, and j is any value.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is any value, `j` is any value**
