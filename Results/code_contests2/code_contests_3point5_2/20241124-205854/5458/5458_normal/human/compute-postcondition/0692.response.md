Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. After the execution of the if statement, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. This holds true for all possible combinations of the variables within the specified constraints, covering all edge cases.***
