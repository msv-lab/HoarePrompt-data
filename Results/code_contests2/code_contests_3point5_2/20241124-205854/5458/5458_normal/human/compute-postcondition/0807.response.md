Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is increased by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is increased by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
