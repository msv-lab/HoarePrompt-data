Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is an integer. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, then added to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. All variables maintain their initial characteristics and values after the execution of the if else block, covering all edge cases.***
