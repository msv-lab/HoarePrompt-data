Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `m` is defined. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues.***
