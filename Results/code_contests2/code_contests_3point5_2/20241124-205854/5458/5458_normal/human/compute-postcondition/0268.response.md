Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment, the previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is updated accordingly**
