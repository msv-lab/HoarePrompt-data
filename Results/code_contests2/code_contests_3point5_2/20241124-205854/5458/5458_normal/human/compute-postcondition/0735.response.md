According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. To execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `i` and `j` can have any value**
