Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` are not changed in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 0**
