Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values from the input after splitting by spaces. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `n`, `m`, and `s`. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)` initialized with all elements as 0**
