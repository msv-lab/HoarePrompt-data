According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `i` and `j` can have any value. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `k` should be considered. So, `k` needs to be adjusted to be the next value in the range starting from 1 to `s`, which is 3 in this case. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` and `j` can have any value**
