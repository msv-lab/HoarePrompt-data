Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer, and `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the modulo operation of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.**
