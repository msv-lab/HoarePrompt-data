Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `i` and `j` can have any value. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. There are no changes to the values of `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` other than the assignment of 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the specified condition.***
