Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` and `s` are at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
