According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `k` is the next value in the range of 1 to `s`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `k` is the next value in the range of 1 to `s`, it needs to be updated to the next value after the current `k`.
- No other states need adjustment.

State: **`j` is 1, `k` is the value after the current value in the range of 1 to `s`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` array is initialized, `i` is an integer**.
