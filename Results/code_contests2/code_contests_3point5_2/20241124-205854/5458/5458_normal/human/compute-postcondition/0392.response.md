Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` remain unchanged. The array `dp` is updated based on the condition `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` in the if-else block, adjusting the values of `k`, `s`, and `dp` accordingly based on the conditions met in the previous iteration. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. This ensures that the state of the program is maintained and updated appropriately based on the conditions met during the execution of the if statement.***
