Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers based on user input, `dp` is updated according to the specified logic, `i` is either 0 or not, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than `s`, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as the modulo of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and added to the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j].***
