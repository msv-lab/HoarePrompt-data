Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` remain unchanged. `dp` is a 2D list with initial zeros except for the element at index `[j + 1][k]` which is set to 1. `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is 1. For `i` greater than 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulus of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then incremented by the modulus of the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
