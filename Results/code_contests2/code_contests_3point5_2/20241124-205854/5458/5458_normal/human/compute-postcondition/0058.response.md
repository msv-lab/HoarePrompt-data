Output State: **All variables remain within their initial constraints. If i is equal to 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is not equal to 0 and j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and the loop continues. If j is not greater than k in the else part, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and then added with dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. All other variables retain their initial conditions and are properly updated within their predefined ranges. `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**
