Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i is 1, j is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, the output state is: i is 1, j is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, s is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is greater than 0.
Output State: **i is 1, j is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, s is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is greater than 0**
