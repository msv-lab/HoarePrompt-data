Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is not specified, so it remains unchanged. The values of `j` and `k` are incremented by 1. The dimensions of `dp` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)`, `j` is 2, `k` is the next value in the range (1 to `s`).
Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)`, `j` is 2, `k` is the next value in the range (1 to `s`)**
