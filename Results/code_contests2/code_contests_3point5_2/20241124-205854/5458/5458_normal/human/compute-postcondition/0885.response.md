Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, if `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is first calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then it is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All variables `m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, and `k` maintain their initial conditions throughout the execution of the if-else block.***
