Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged. The `dp` array is updated based on the conditions within the loop. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. All other variables and arrays retain their original values.***
