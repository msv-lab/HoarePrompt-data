Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` remain unchanged. The array `dp` is updated based on the conditions within the if-else block. If i == 0 and j >= k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If i > 0 and j > k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If j <= k in the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This covers all possible scenarios and updates the array `dp` accordingly, maintaining the relationships between the variables and the array elements.***
