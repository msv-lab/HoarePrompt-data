Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `j` and `k` are incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `k` are integers incremented by 1, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
Output State: **`j`, `k` are integers incremented by 1, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
