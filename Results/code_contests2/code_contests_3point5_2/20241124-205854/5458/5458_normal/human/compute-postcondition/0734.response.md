Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i`, and `j` can have any value. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and the loop continues. In both cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is further incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
