Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` % mod and the iteration continues. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` % mod added to the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` % mod.***
