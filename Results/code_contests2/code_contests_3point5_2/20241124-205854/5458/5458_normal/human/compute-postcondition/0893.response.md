Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, and the modulo `mod` is also specified. Therefore, the updated value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` can be calculated based on the previous state.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 3, and the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated**
