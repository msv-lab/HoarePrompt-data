According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `m` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `n` needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)` initialized with all elements as 0, and `j` is initialized to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)` initialized with all elements as 0, `j` is 1**
