According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, `k` are positive integers. The conditions for the loop to execute one more time are not explicitly stated, so we need to consider all possibilities.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` needs to be less than `s + 1`

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, `k` are positive integers, `k` is less than `s + 1**
