Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is taken from the previous state. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the given formula, while all other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the given formula, while all other variables remain unchanged**
