Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is either 0 or incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1, and if j is greater than or equal to k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
