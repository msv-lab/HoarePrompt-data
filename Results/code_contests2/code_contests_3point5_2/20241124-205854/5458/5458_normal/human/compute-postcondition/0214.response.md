According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. 

Since the loop will execute one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- If `s` is at least 1:
    - `i` will remain unchanged.
    - `j` will increase by 1.
    - `k` will remain unchanged.
    - `s` will remain an integer.
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`:
    - `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`:
    - `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will become equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
- If `j` is not greater than `k`:
    - `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated by adding the modular division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.

State: **`i` is unchanged, `j` increases by 1, `k` is unchanged, `s` remains an integer**
