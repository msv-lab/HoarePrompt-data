Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `s`, `m` are defined integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues. In this case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and after execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is further updated by adding the modulus of the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.***
