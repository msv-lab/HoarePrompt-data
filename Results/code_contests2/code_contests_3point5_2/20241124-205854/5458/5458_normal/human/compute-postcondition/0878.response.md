Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The previous values are `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, and `k` is 2. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` remains an integer, `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
