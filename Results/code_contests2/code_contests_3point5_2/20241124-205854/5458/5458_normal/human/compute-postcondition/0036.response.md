Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers based on user input, `dp` is updated according to the specified logic, `i` is either 0 or not, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than `s` plus 1, `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. After executing the code snippet, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of dividing the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.**
