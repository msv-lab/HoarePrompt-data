According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions were as follows: `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` was set to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` remains 0
- `j` remains the same as it doesn't have any constraints mentioned
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1 as it is being updated in the loop
- The value of `s` doesn't have any constraints mentioned, so it remains the same

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is incremented by 1, `s` remains the same**
