Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged. The `dp` array is updated based on the conditions within the if-else block. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, the `dp` array is updated according to the conditions specified in the program fragment. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and ensures the integrity of the variables and the `dp` array after the execution of the if-else block.***
