According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to s + 1. Before the loop starts, all the initial conditions are already met except for k. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted so that k is within the range of 1 to s + 1.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` retains its value, `dp` array is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1**
