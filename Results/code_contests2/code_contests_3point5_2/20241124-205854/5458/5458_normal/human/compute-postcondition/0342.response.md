Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` retains its original value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)` initialized with all elements as 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After executing the provided code snippet, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.**
