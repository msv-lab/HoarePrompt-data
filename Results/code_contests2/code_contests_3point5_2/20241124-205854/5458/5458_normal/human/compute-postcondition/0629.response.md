Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are adjusted accordingly based on the conditions mentioned in the if else block to maintain loop execution. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. `k` remains within the range of 1 to `s`.**
