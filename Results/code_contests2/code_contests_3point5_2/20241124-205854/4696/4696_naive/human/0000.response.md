Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). The program iterates through all possible permutations and calculates the factorial of n-k, then divides i by this factorial to determine the index of the next element to be included in the permutation. The program then removes this element from the list of available numbers and updates i accordingly. This process is repeated until all elements are included in the permutation.

Since the program follows the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where the program would fail to produce the correct output, the correctness of the program is **True**.
