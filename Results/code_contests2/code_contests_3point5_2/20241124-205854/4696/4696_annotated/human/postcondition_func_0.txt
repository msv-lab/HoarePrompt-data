The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user input. It then calculates the maximum possible value of f(p) where n and m are positive integers satisfying 1 <= m <= n, by performing permutations based on the values of n and m. The function iterates through a loop to calculate permutations and print the result until k reaches n. If n is less than or equal to m, the loop will execute at least once. If n is less than 1 or m is greater than n, the loop will not execute. The function's purpose is to determine the maximum possible value of f(p) for given n and m.
