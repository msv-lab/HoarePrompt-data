You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a permutation p of numbers 1, 2, ..., n. Let's define f(p) as the following sum:

<image>

Find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p).

Input

The single line of input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p).

The problem consists of two subproblems. The subproblems have different constraints on the input. You will get some score for the correct submission of the subproblem. The description of the subproblems follows.

  * In subproblem B1 (3 points), the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 8 will hold. 
  * In subproblem B2 (4 points), the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 will hold. 

Output

Output n number forming the required permutation.

Examples

Input

2 2


Output

2 1 


Input

3 2


Output

1 3 2 

Note

In the first example, both permutations of numbers {1, 2} yield maximum possible f(p) which is equal to 4. Among them, (2, 1) comes second in lexicographical order.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    a, b = raw_input().split()
    n = int(a)
    i = int(b)
    i = i - 1
    p = range(1, n + 1)
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        f = factorial(n - k)
        
        d = i // f
        
        print(p[d]),
        
        p.remove(p[d])
        
        i = i % f
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop calculates the permutation of the elements in the range from 1 to n based on the value of i. It prints the element at index d of the range p, removes that element, and updates i. The loop continues until k reaches n. If n is less than or equal to m, the loop will execute at least once. If n is less than 1 or m is greater than n, the loop will not execute. Variables after the loop execution: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, a and b are assigned values from the input split operation, i is an integer value of b - 1, p is a range starting from 1 to n (inclusive) with the element at index d removed, k is equal to n, f is the factorial of n - k, d is the result of i // f, and i is updated to the remainder of i / f.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
