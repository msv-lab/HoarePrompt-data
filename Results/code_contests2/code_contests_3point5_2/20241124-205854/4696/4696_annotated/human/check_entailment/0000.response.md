Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). It calculates the permutation based on the given input values of n and m by iterating through the range of 1 to n, calculating the factorial, finding the index to print, removing the element, and updating i accordingly. The program handles all potential cases within the given constraints and produces the correct output.
