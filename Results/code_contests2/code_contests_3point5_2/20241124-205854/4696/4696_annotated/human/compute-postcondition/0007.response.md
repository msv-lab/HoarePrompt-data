Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated by dividing `i` by `f`, where `i` is `b - 1` and `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`. The value of `b` is obtained from input split operation and `n` is a positive integer. The range `p` starts from 1 to `n`. The value of `k` is 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split operation, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` is a range starting from 1 to n (inclusive), `k` is 1, `f` is the factorial of n - 1, `d` is the result of `i // f`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split operation, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` is a range starting from 1 to n (inclusive), `k` is 1, `f` is the factorial of n - 1, `d` is the result of `i // f`**
