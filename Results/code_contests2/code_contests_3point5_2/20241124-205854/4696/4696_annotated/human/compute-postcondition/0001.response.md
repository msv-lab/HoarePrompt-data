Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the integer value of `a` which is obtained from the input split operation. The value of `n` is now a positive integer. The variables `m`, `cntn`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split operation**
