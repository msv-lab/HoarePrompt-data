According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. In this case, `n` is already a positive integer. The loop will start from 1 and go up to `n` inclusive, so `k` will take on values from 1 to `n`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to set `k` to 1, since the loop starts at 1. Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split operation, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` is a range starting from 1 to n (inclusive), `k` is 1**
