Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split operation, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` is a range starting from 1 to n (inclusive) with the element at index `d` removed, `k` is incremented to the next integer value after the previous last iteration, `f` is the factorial of n - 1, `d` is the result of `i // f`, `i` is updated to the remainder of `i / f`, `f` is assigned the value of factorial(n - k)**
