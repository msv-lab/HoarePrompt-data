Example Answer: 
`i` is assigned the integer value of `b`. Since `b` is assigned a value from the input split operation, the value of `i` will depend on the input provided. The other variables `n`, `m`, `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split operation, `i` is an integer value of `b`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split operation, `i` is an integer value of `b`**
