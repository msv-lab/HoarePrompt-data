According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

1. Update `k` to the next integer value after the previous last iteration.
2. Update `f` to the factorial of n - k.
3. Update `i` to the remainder of `i / f`.
4. Update `d` to the result of `i // f`.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split operation, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` is a range starting from 1 to n (inclusive) with the element at index `d` removed, `k` is incremented to the next integer value after the previous last iteration, `f` is the factorial of n - k, `d` is the result of `i // f`, `i` is updated to the remainder of `i / f`, `i` is updated to the remainder of `i / f`**
