According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, `i` is the remainder of the division of n-1 or m-1 by the factorial of n - 2, `k` is 2, `f` is the factorial of n - 2, `d` is an integer value calculated from the division of `i` by `f`, and an element has been removed from the list `p` at index `d`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k + 1`, and no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, `i` is the remainder of the division of n-1 or m-1 by the factorial of n - 2, `k` is 3, `f` is the factorial of n - 2, `d` is an integer value calculated from the division of `i` by `f`, and an element has been removed from the list `p` at index `d`**
