According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n. The new value of `i` is either `n-1` or `m-1` based on the value of `b`. `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`, and `d` is an integer value calculated from the division of `i` by `f`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Update `k` to be the next value after the last iteration, which is `k + 1`.
2. Since the loop condition is `k` should be less than or equal to `n`, and `k` was 1 at the end of the last iteration, update `k` to `2`.
3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, the new value of `i` is either `n-1` or `m-1` based on the value of `b`, `k` is 2, `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`, and `d` is an integer value calculated from the division of `i` by `f**.
