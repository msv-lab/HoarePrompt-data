Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(a)`, where `a` is a variable of unknown value. The value of `n` is now determined by converting `a` to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn**
