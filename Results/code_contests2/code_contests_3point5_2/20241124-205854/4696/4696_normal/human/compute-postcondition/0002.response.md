Example Answer: 
`i` is assigned the value of `int(b)`, but the initial state does not provide the value of `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, and the value of `i` is dependent on the value of `b`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, and the value of `i` is dependent on the value of `b`**
