The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns the maximum possible value of f(p) for permutations of length n, where n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn. The maximum value of f(p) is based on the constraints given. 
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns the maximum possible value of f(p) for permutations of length n based on the given constraints.**
