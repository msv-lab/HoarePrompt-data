Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes in two integers `n` and `m` as input and calculates the lexicographically m-th permutation of length `n` in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p).
- The code uses factorials to determine the position of each element in the permutation based on the value of `m`.
- It iterates through the list `p`, removes elements based on calculations, and prints them accordingly to form the required permutation.
- The code considers all possible permutations for the given input values of `n` and `m` and correctly outputs the desired permutation.
