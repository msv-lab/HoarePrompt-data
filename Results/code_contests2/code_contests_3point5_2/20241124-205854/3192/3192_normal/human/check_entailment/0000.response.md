Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input as described in the problem statement.
- It calculates the maximum salary in each company and stores it in the `arr` list.
- It also stores the number of employees in each company in the `arr2` list.
- Then, it finds the maximum value in `arr` and calculates the total increase needed by taking the difference between the maximum salary and each individual salary in a company, and then multiplying it by the number of employees in that company.
- Finally, it prints the total minimal increase required to merge all companies into one.

The code seems to be following the problem description accurately and the logic implemented in the code aligns with the requirements specified. The output hints also confirm that the code is performing the necessary calculations to find the minimal total increase of all salaries that allows merging all companies. Therefore, based on the provided information, the correctness of the code is deemed to be True.
