Example Answer:
The value at index 0 of `arr1` is appended to `arr2`. Since `arr1` contains the value of `temp`, and `temp` is either the maximum value in `arr1` or 0, `arr2` now contains the maximum value in `arr1` or 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is either the maximum value in `arr1` or 0; `arr` contains the value of `temp`; `arr2` contains the maximum value in `arr1` or 0.
Output State: **`temp` is either the maximum value in `arr1` or 0; `arr` contains the value of `temp`; `arr2` contains the maximum value in `arr1` or 0**
