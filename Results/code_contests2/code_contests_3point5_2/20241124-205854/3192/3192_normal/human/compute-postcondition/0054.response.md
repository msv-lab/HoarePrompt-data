Example Answer:
The code calculates a new value based on the difference between `maxval` and `arr[i]` multiplied by `arr2[i]`, then adds this value to the `ans` variable. The previous values are: `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` or 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1` list, `arr2` contains the size of each `arr1` list, `maxval` contains the new maximum value in `arr`, `i` is equal to 2, `n` is not equal to 0, and `ans` is updated after the calculation. 
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` or 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1` list, `arr2` contains the size of each `arr1` list, `maxval` contains the new maximum value in `arr`, `i` is equal to 2, `n` is not equal to 0, `ans` is updated after the calculation**
