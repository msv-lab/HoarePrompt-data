Example Answer:
The variable `maxval` is updated to be the maximum value between the current element `arr[i]` and the existing `maxval`. The initial state indicates that `temp` is either the maximum value in `arr1` or 0, so `maxval` will be updated accordingly. After the code execution, `maxval` will hold the maximum value between the previous value of `maxval` and the current element `arr[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is either the maximum value in `arr1` or 0; `arr` contains the value of `temp`; `arr2` contains the maximum value in `arr1` or 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value.
Output State: **`temp` is either the maximum value in `arr1` or 0; `arr` contains the value of `temp`; `arr2` contains the maximum value in `arr1` or 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value**
