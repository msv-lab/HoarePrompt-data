According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` or 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1` list, `arr2` contains the size of each `arr1` list, `maxval` contains the new maximum value in `arr`, `i` is equal to 0, `n` is not equal to 0, `ans` is 0**
