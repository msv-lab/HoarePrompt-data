Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, where `maxval` is the new maximum value in `arr`, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1` list, `arr2` contains the size of each `arr1` list, and `i` is equal to 1. The value of `n` is not used in this calculation. The output state after execution is: `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` or 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1` list, `arr2` contains the size of each `arr1` list, `maxval` contains the new maximum value in `arr`, `i` is equal to 1, `n` is not equal to 0, `ans` is updated after the calculation.
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` or 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1` list, `arr2` contains the size of each `arr1` list, `maxval` contains the new maximum value in `arr`, `i` is equal to 1, `n` is not equal to 0, `ans` is updated after the calculation**
