According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `temp` is 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is greater than 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
