Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` is currently 0, and `j` is 1. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `arr1[j]` will be a valid index. Therefore, the value of `temp` will be updated to the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[1]`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is greater than 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers, `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**.
