Example Answer: 
The value of `temp` is appended to the list `arr`. If the loop did not execute because `arr1[0]` is less than 1, then `temp` remains 0. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is either the maximum value in `arr1` or 0, and `arr` contains the value of `temp`.
Output State: **`temp` is either the maximum value in `arr1` or 0; `arr` contains the value of `temp`**
