Example Answer: 
`maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`. The values of `arr`, `arr2`, `temp`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp`, `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, `arr2` appends the value of `arr1[0] is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`.
Output State: **`temp`, `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, `arr2` appends the value of `arr1[0] is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`**
