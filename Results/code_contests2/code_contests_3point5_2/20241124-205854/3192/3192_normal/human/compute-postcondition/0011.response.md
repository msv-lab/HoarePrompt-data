According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is greater than 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers, `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and the maximum of `arr1[j]` and `temp`, `j` is 3, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
