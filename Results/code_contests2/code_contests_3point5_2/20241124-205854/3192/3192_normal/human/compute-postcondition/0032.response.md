According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is updated to the maximum value in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`; `arr` contains the appended `temp`; `arr2` contains 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value; `i` is one more than the previous value; if `arr1[0]` is less than 2 the loop does not execute, `arr2` contains the appended value of `arr1[0]; `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to one more than the previous value.
State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum value in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`; `arr` contains the appended `temp`; `arr2` contains 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value; `i` is one more than the previous value; if `arr1[0]` is less than 2 the loop does not execute, `arr2` contains the appended value of `arr1[0]; `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`; `i` is one more than the previous value; `n` is greater than the updated `i`.**
