Output State: **`temp` is 0; `arr` contains the appended `temp`; `arr2` contains 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value; `i` is one more than the previous value; if `arr1[0]` is less than 2 the loop does not execute, `arr2` contains the appended value of `arr1[0]; `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`; `i` is one more than the previous value; `n` is greater than the updated `i`**
