According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr` contains the appended `temp`, `arr2` contains 0, `maxval` contains the new maximum value, `i` is one more than the previous value, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr2` contains the appended value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is one more than the previous value, `n` is greater than the updated `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`; `arr` contains the appended `temp`; `arr2` contains 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value; `i` is one more than the previous value; `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2; `arr2` contains the appended value of `arr1[0]; `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`; `i` is one more than the previous value; `n` is greater than the updated `i`; `j` is incremented by 1**
