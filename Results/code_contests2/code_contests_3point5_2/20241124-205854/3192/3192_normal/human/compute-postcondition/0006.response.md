Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is greater than 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers, `temp` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is greater than 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers, `temp` is 0**
