Example Answer: 
`ans` is incremented by the value of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. The current value of `ans` is 0, and the values of `maxval`, `arr`, `arr2`, `i` have been provided. After execution, the new value of `ans` will be calculated based on the provided values. 
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` or 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1` list, `arr2` contains the size of each `arr1` list, `maxval` contains the new maximum value in `arr`, `i` is equal to 0, `n` is not equal to 0, `ans` is the updated value after the calculation**
