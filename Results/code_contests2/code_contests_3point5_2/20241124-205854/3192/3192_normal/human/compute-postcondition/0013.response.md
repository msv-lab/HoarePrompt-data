According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented and be less than `arr1[0]`. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to 4 to satisfy the loop condition.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is greater than 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers, `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and the maximum of `arr1[j]` and `temp`, `j` is 4, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `temp` and `arr1[3]**
