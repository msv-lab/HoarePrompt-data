Example Answer: 
`temp` is updated to be the maximum of the current `temp` and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is 2. The value of `temp` will be the maximum between its current value and the value of `arr1[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is updated to the new maximum value, `arr` contains 0, `arr2` contains 0, `maxval` contains the new maximum value, `i` is one more than the previous value, `j` is 2, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2.
Output State: **`temp` is updated to the new maximum value; `arr` contains 0; `arr2` contains 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value; `i` is one more than the previous value; `j` is 2; `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2**
