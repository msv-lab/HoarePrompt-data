According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` or 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1` list, `arr2` contains the size of each `arr1` list, `maxval` contains the new maximum value in `arr`, `i` is equal to 0, `n` is not equal to 0, `ans` is the updated value after the calculation. To adjust for the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` or 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1` list, `arr2` contains the size of each `arr1` list, `maxval` contains the new maximum value in `arr`, `i` is equal to 1, `n` is not equal to 0, `ans` is the updated value after the calculation**
