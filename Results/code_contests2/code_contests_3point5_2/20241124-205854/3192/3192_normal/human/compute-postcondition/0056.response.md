Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop calculates the sum of products of differences between maxval and each element in arr multiplied by the corresponding element in arr2 and adds it to ans. After the loop execution, temp remains the maximum value in arr1 or 0, arr contains the maximum value in each arr1 list, arr2 contains the size of each arr1 list, maxval contains the new maximum value in arr, i is equal to n, and ans is the final updated value. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and ans remains 0.**
