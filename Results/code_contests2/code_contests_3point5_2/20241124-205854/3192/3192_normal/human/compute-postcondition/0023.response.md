According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and the condition `j` is less than `arr1[0]` needs to hold true. 
State: **`temp` is updated to be the maximum of the current `temp` and `arr1[j]`; `arr` contains 0; `arr2` contains 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value; `i` is one more than the previous value; `j` is 2; `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2**
