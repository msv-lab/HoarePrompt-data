According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the `arr` list is empty, so it needs to be adjusted to have a length of at least 1 element. Also, since `maxval` is 0, it should be adjusted to a value greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes. Additionally, `arr2` being an empty list does not affect the loop execution. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is greater than 0, `arr2` is an empty list**
