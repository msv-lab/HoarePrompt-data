According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp`, `arr`, `maxval`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, `arr2` appends the value of `arr1[0] is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to increment by 1.
State: **`temp`, `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, `i+1`, and `n` remain unchanged**
