According to the code, the loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`temp` is 0; `arr` contains the appended `temp`; `arr2` contains 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value; `i` is one more than the previous value; `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2; `arr2` contains the appended value of `arr1[0]; `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`; `i` is one more than the previous value; `n` is greater than the updated `i`**
