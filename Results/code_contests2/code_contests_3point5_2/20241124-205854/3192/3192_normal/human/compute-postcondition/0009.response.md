For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is greater than 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers, `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
