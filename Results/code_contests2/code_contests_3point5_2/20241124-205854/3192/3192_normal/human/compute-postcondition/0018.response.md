According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is either the maximum value in `arr1` or 0; `arr` contains the value of `temp`; `arr2` contains the maximum value in `arr1` or 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value. 

To execute the loop one more time, the `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is:
State: **`temp` is either the maximum value in `arr1` or 0; `arr` contains the value of `temp`; `arr2` contains the maximum value in `arr1` or 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value; `i` is one more than the previous value.**
