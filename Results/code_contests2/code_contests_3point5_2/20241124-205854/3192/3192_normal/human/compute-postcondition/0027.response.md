According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so it should be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`temp` is updated to the new maximum value; `arr` contains 0; `arr2` contains 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value; `i` is one more than the previous value; `j` is 4; `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2; `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[3]**
