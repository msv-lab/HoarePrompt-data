According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is updated to the new maximum value, `arr` contains 0, `arr2` contains 0, `maxval` contains the new maximum value, `i` is one more than the previous value, `j` is 2, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`temp` is updated to the new maximum value; `arr` contains 0; `arr2` contains 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value; `i` is one more than the previous value; `j` is 3; `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2**
