According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr` contains the appended `temp`, `arr2` contains 0, `maxval` contains the new maximum value, `i` is one more than the previous value, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr2` contains the appended value of `arr1[0], `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is one more than the previous value, `n` is greater than the updated `i`, `j` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and the condition `j` is less than `arr1[0]` needs to be maintained. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`; `arr` contains the appended `temp`; `arr2` contains 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value; `i` is one more than the previous value; `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2; `arr2` contains the appended value of `arr1[0]; `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`; `i` is one more than the previous value; `n` is greater than the updated `i`; `j` is incremented by 1; `j` is less than `arr1[0]`**
