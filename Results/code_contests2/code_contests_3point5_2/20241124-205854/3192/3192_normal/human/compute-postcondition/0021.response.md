According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `temp` is 0; `arr` contains 0; `arr2` contains 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value; `i` is one more than the previous value does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `temp` is 0; `arr` contains 0; `arr2` contains 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value; `i` is one more than the previous value; `j` is 1.
State: **`temp` is 0; `arr` contains 0; `arr2` contains 0; `maxval` contains the new maximum value; `i` is one more than the previous value; `j` is 1; `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2**
