Output State: 
- If `arr1[0]` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. In this case, `temp`, `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- If the loop executes, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr` contains the appended `temp`, `arr2` contains 0, `maxval` contains the new maximum value, `i` is one more than the previous value, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr2` contains the appended value of `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is one more than the previous value, `n` is greater than the updated `i`, and `j` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.
Output State: **Based on the conditions and loop execution, the variables `temp`, `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, `i`, and `n` may or may not change depending on the values of `arr1[0]`, `arr1[j]`, and the loop execution.**
