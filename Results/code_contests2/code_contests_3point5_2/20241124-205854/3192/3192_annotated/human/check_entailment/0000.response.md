Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input, processes the data, and calculates the minimal total increase of all employees as required by the problem description.
2. The program iterates over each company, finds the maximum salary within each company, and stores the maximum salary of each company and the total number of employees in each company in separate lists (`arr` and `arr2` respectively).
3. It then calculates the total increase needed for each company's maximum salary to match the highest salary among all employees (`maxval`) and sums up these increases to get the final result.
4. The program handles the edge cases where there are no companies in the conglomerate (`n = 0`) and when a company has only one employee.
5. The logic of the program follows the problem description accurately and there are no potential cases identified where the program fails to meet the requirements.
