Output State: **If `arr1[0]` is at least 2, then `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` has `temp` appended to it. If `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, `maxval` remains as it is, `i` is not incremented, `arr` remains unchanged, `n`, `arr2` remain unchanged, `temp` is not updated, `j` is not incremented. `arr2` has `arr1[0]` appended to it.**
