Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, where `i` is 2. The initial values of `ans`, `i`, and `n` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0**
