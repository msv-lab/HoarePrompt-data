According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is greater than 0, it does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3**
