According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1` contains at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2 since it should be less than `arr1[0]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing the integers entered through input, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 2, `arr1` contains at least 1 element**
