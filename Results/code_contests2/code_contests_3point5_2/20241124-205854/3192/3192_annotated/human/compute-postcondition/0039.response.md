According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3 to satisfy the loop condition.
State: **`temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
