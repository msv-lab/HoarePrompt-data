According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.
State: **`temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
