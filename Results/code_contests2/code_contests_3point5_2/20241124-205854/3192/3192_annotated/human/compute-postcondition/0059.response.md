Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the number of companies in a conglomerate. For each company, it reads the number of employees and their salaries. It then calculates the maximum salary within each company and the maximum salary across all companies. Afterward, it computes a value `ans` based on a specific formula using the maximum salary values and the total number of employees in each company. Finally, it prints out the calculated `ans`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the function prints 0. If a company has only one employee, the loop does not run for that company, and the maximum salary remains 0.**
