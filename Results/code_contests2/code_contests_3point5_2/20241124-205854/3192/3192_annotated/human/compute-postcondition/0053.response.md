According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` being greater than 0 ensures the loop will execute again, the only state that needs adjustment is `i` which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0**
