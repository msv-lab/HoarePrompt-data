According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1[0]` has been increased by 1. So, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than the new value of `arr1[0]`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`maxval` is `arr1[0]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` has `temp` appended to it, `n`, `arr2` remain unchanged, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is increased by 1, `j` is incremented by 1**
