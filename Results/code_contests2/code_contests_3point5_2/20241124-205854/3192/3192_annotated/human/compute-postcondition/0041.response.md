According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. This means the loop can execute one more time. To adjust the states for the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 4, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
