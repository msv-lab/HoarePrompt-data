Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value between 0 and the elements in `arr1[1:]`, `j` is the index of the element being compared, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute. If `arr1[0]` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute and `temp` remains 0. `arr` has `temp` appended to it, `arr2` has `arr1[0]` appended to it.**
