Output State: If arr1[0] is at least 2, then maxval is the maximum value in arr1 after the loop execution, i is incremented by 1, arr has temp appended to it. If arr1[0] is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, and maxval remains as 0, i is not incremented, arr remains unchanged, n, arr2 remain unchanged, temp is not updated, j is not incremented. `arr2` has `arr1[0]` appended to it.
