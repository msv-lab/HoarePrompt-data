Example Answer:
maxval is updated to the maximum value between arr[i] and maxval. The values of n, arr, temp, and arr2 remain unchanged. temp is not explicitly mentioned, so it remains 0. The updated arr has temp appended to it.
Output State: **n, arr, maxval, arr2 remain unchanged. maxval is updated. arr has temp appended to it.**
