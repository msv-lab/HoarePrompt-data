Output State: **If arr1 contains at least 1 element, temp is updated to the maximum value between its current value and arr1[j] for each iteration of the loop. If arr1 is empty or j is greater than or equal to the length of arr1, the loop does not execute and temp remains 0. n, arr, maxval, arr2 remain unchanged.**
