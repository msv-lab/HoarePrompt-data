Example Answer: 
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value (maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`) and `arr1[j]` where `j` is 2. Since the initial state states that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, we can assume that `arr1[2]` is also greater than 1. Therefore, the new value of `temp` will be the maximum between the current value of `temp` and `arr1[2]`. The states of `j` and `arr1[0]` do not change. 
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
