Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is 1. The previous value of `temp` is 0, and the previous value of `arr1[j]` is unknown. The output state will depend on the comparison between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
