Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` can change based on the comparison. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing the integers entered through input, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 1, `arr1` contains at least 1 element.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing the integers entered through input, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 1, `arr1` contains at least 1 element**
