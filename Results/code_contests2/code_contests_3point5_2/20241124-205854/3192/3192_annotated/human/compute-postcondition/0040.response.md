Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and the value at index `j` in `arr1`. Since `temp` is already the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`, the value of `temp` remains unchanged. The value of `j` is 3, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, so the output state is: `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
