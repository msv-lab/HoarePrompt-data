Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. The variables `i`, `n`, and the specific values of `maxval`, `arr[i]`, and `arr2[i]` are not provided, so the output state is: `ans` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
