Since the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- If `arr1[0]` is at least 2, then `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `arr` has `temp` appended to it.
- If `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, `maxval` remains as 0, `i` is not incremented, `arr` remains unchanged, `n`, `arr2` remain unchanged, `temp` is not updated, `j` is not incremented. 
- `arr2` has `arr1[0]` appended to it.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:
- If `arr1[0]` is at least 2, then `maxval` is updated to the maximum value in `arr1`.
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `arr` needs to have `temp` appended to it if `arr1[0]` is at least 2.
- If `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, no changes are made to `maxval`, `i`, `arr`, `n`, `arr2`, `temp`, and `j`.
- `arr2` has `arr1[0]` appended to it.

State: **If `arr1[0]` is at least 2, then `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` has `temp` appended to it. If `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, `maxval` remains as it is, `i` is not incremented, `arr` remains unchanged, `n`, `arr2` remain unchanged, `temp` is not updated, `j` is not incremented. `arr2` has `arr1[0]` appended to it.**
