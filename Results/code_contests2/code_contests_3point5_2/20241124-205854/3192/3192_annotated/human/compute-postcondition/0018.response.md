According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `arr`, and `arr2` remain unchanged, `maxval` has been updated, and `temp` has been appended to `arr`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the previous iteration.
State: **n, arr, maxval, arr2 remain unchanged. maxval is updated. arr has temp appended to it. i is incremented by 1.**
