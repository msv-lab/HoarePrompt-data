According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`. Before the loop starts, `maxval` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 1, `arr1` contains at least 1 element, and `temp` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing the integers entered through input, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr1` contains at least 1 element**
