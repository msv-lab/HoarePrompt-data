According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `temp` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `temp` is 0 and `j` is 1.
State: **`temp` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
