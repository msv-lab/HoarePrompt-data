According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]` and the range of `j`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxval` is `arr1[0]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` has `temp` appended to it, `n`, `arr2` remain unchanged, `temp` is updated to the maximum value. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be less than `arr1[0]`. So the states that need to be adjusted are: `maxval` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` has `temp` appended to it, `n`, `arr2` remain unchanged, `temp` is updated to the maximum value, and `arr1[0]` value should be increased by 1.
State: **`maxval` is `arr1[0]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` has `temp` appended to it, `n`, `arr2` remain unchanged, `temp` is updated to the maximum value, `arr1[0]` is increased by 1**
