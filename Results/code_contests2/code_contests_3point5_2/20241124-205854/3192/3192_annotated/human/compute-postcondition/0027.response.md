According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxval` is `arr1[0]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` has `temp` appended to it, `n`, `arr2` remain unchanged, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is increased by 1, `j` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be less than the updated `arr1[0]` and `temp` needs to be updated again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`maxval` is `arr1[0]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` has `temp` appended to it, `n`, `arr2` remain unchanged, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is increased by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than updated `arr1[0]`, `temp` is updated again**
