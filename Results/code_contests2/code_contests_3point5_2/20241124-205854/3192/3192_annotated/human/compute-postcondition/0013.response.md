According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `arr1` contains at least 1 element. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to less than `arr1[0]`. Since `arr1` contains at least 1 element, the condition `arr1[0]` being greater than 1 will ensure the loop executes again.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing the integers entered through input, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 4, `arr1` contains at least 1 element**
