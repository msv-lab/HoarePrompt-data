Example Answer: 
`ans` is incremented by the value of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, where `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are unknown. The previous state shows that `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
