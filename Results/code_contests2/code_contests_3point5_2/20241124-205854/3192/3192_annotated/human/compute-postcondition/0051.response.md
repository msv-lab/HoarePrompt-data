According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is 0 and the loop can execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` should be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
