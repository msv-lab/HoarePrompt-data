According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` compared to the first element of `arr1`. In this case, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr1` contains at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than the first element of `arr1` and considering that `j` is 2, it should be updated to 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing the integers entered through input, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 3, `arr1` contains at least 1 element, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`**
