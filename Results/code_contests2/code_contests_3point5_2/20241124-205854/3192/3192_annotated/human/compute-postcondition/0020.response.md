Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value 0. The variables n, arr, maxval, and arr2 remain unchanged. The value of maxval is updated to 0. The value of i is incremented by 1. The value of temp is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: n, arr, maxval, arr2 remain unchanged. maxval is 0. arr has temp appended to it. i is incremented by 1.
Output State: **n, arr, maxval, arr2 remain unchanged. maxval is 0. arr has temp appended to it. i is incremented by 1**
