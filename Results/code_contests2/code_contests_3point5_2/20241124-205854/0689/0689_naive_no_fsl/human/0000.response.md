Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly takes two strings as input, then iterates over all possible rotations of string T and compares it with string S. If any rotation matches S, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases.
