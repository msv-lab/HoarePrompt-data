Example Answer: 
The code checks if any rotation of string `t` matches the string `s`. If any rotation matches, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The values of `s` and `t` are entered by the user. The output state depends on whether any rotation of `t` matches `s`. 
Output State: **`s` is a string entered by the user, `t` is a string entered by the user and either 'Yes' or 'No' is printed based on the match between rotations of `t` and `s`**
