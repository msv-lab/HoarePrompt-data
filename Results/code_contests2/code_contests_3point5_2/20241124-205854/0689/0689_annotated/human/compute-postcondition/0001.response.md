Example Answer:
The value entered by the user is stored in variable `t` using the `raw_input()` function. The initial state `s` being a string entered by the user is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string entered by the user, `t` is a string entered by the user.
Output State: **`s` is a string entered by the user, `t` is a string entered by the user**
