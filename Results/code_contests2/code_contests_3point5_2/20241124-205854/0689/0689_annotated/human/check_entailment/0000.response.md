Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code takes two input strings `s` and `t`, and then checks if `s` equals `t` after rotation. It does so by generating all possible rotations of `t` and checking if any of them equal `s`. If any rotation of `t` matches `s`, then it prints `Yes`, otherwise it prints `No`. The code logic is correct and handles the problem description accurately. It covers all potential cases and correctly determines if `s` equals `t` after rotation.
