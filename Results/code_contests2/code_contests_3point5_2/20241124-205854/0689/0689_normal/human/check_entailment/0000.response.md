Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes two strings `s` and `t` as input and checks if any rotation of string `t` matches string `s`. It then prints 'Yes' if there is a match, and 'No' otherwise. The code correctly implements the rotation operation described in the problem statement. The code iterates through all possible rotations of string `t`, checks if it matches string `s`, and prints the appropriate output. The code meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
