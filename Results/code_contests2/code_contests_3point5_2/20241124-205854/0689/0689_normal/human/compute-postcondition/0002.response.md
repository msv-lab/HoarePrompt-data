Example Answer:
The code checks if any rotation of the string `t` matches the input string `s`. If there is a match, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The previous values of `s` and `t` are not changed. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is the input string, `t` is the user input.
Output State: **`s` is the input string, `t` is the user input**
