Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case when a passenger arrives at the same time as the elevator reaching their floor. This is because the code only checks if the time passed is less than the passenger's arrival time, without considering the case where they arrive exactly at that time. This can lead to incorrect results as the passenger might not be picked up in time.
