Example Answer: 
`n` and `s` are assigned values using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts space-separated inputs and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. Given the preconditions, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000**
