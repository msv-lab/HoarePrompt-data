Output State: **After the loop executes, `p` will contain tuples `(fi, ti)` for each iteration, where `fi` and `ti` are the integers obtained from input split. `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` will be a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `i` will be the number of iterations completed. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute and `p` will remain empty.**
