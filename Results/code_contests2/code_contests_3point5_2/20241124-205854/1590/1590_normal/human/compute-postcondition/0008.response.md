According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the appended tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Additionally, if `n` is the upper limit of the range, it is important to increment `n` to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the appended tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2**
