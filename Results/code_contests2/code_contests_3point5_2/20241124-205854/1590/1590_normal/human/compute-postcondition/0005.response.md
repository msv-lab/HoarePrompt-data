According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains one tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains one tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1**
