Example Answer:
The list `p` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is an empty list**
