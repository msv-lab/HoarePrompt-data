According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Before the loop starts, `p` is an empty list. To ensure the loop executes, you need to adjust the state such that `i` starts at 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
