According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `p` contains a tuple `(0, 0)` and `time_passed` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`p` contains a tuple `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0**
