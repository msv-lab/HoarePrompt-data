Example Answer:
A tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`, where `fi` and `ti` are obtained by mapping integers from the input split. The input values are split and mapped to `fi` and `ti`, which are then appended to the list `p`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the appended tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are assigned the values obtained by mapping integers from the input split.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the appended tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are assigned the values obtained by mapping integers from the input split**
