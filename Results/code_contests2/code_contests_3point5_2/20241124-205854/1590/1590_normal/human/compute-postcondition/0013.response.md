Example Answer:
The list `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order using a lambda function. The sorting operation modifies the order of elements in `p`, and the sorting is done in place, so the original list `p` is changed. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **After the loop executes, `p` will contain tuples `(fi, ti)` for each iteration, where `fi` and `ti` are the integers obtained from input split. `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` will be a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `i` will be the number of iterations completed. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute and `p` will remain empty.**
