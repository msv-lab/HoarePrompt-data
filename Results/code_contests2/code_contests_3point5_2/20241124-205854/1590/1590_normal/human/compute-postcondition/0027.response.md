According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` contains a tuple `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is incremented by `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `time_passed` is equal to `s`, `s` is 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `time_passed` needs to be updated based on the condition mentioned in the problem statement. Since `i` is 1, the condition `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]` is not met, so no update is needed for `time_passed`.

State: **`p` contains a tuple `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is incremented by `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `time_passed` is equal to `s`, `s` is 0**
