Example Answer:
`time_passed` is assigned the value `0`. Since `p` contains a tuple `(0, 0)`, and no operations are done on `p`, the state of `p` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` contains a tuple `(0, 0)` and `time_passed` is 0.
Output State: **`p` contains a tuple `(0, 0)` and `time_passed` is 0**
