Postcondition: ***`p` contains a tuple `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is incremented by `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `time_passed` is equal to `s`, `s` is 0. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1] - time_passed`. This ensures that `time_passed` is at least equal to `p[i][1]` after the if else block executes, handling all possible cases and edge scenarios.***
