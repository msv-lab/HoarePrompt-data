Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user, sorts the input data based on certain criteria, calculates the time passed for a specific scenario involving passengers and time intervals, and finally prints the total time passed. However, there is a potential issue with the indexing in the loop where it might access an element outside the bounds of the list `p`. This could lead to an `IndexError` if `n` is not handled properly. **
