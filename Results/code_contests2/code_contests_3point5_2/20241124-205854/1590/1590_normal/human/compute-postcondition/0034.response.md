Output State: **`p` contains a tuple `(0, 0)`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the current iteration index, `s` is updated to `p[i][0]`, and `time_passed` is incremented by `s`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, it is adjusted to be at least equal to `p[i][1]`. The loop will not execute if `n` is less than 0.**
