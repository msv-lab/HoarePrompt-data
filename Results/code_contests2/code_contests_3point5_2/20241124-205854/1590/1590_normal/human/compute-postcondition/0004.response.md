Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained from integer inputs. As the list `p` was initially empty, after execution, it will contain one tuple with values `(fi, ti)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains one tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0, `fi` and `ti` are integer inputs.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains one tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0, `fi` and `ti` are integer inputs**
