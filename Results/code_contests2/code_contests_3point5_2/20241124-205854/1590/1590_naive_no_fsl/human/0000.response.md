Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It sorts the passengers based on their arrival floor in descending order, simulates the elevator moving down the floors, and calculates the total time needed to bring all passengers to floor 0. The program handles all the possible cases and follows the problem requirements for each input scenario. Therefore, the program is correct and outputs the minimum amount of time needed to bring all passengers to floor 0 as expected.
