Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`, where `p` is a list of lists and `i` is an index. The value of `s` depends on the value at index `i` in list `p`. The value of `time_passed` is increased by the difference between the previous value of `s` and `p[i][0]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `time_passed` is increased by the difference between previous `s` and `p[i][0]`.
Output State: **`time_passed` is increased by the difference between previous `s` and `p[i][0]**
