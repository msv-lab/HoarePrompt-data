According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `time_passed` is increased by the difference between the previous `s` and `p[i][0]` if `time_passed` was less than `p[i][1]`. If `time_passed` was already greater than or equal to `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` remains unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is `time_passed` is increased by the difference between the previous `s` and `p[i+1][0]` if `time_passed` was less than `p[i+1][1]`. If `time_passed` was already greater than or equal to `p[i+1][1]`, then `time_passed` remains unchanged.
State: **`time_passed` is increased by the difference between the previous `s` and `p[i+1][0]` if `time_passed` was less than `p[i+1][1]`, for the next iteration of the loop.**
