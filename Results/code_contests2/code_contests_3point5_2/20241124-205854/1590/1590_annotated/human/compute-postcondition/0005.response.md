According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `fi` is an integer input, `ti` is an integer input. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, `fi` is an integer input, `ti` is an integer input**
