Example Answer:
`p` is initialized as an empty list. It does not affect the values of `n` and `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is an empty list**
