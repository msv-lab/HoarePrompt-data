Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the first value from the input split as an integer, and `s` is assigned the second value from the input split as an integer. The input split takes two integers separated by a space. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000**
