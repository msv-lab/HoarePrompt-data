Example Answer:
`p` appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained from integer inputs. So after execution, `p` will contain the appended tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `fi` is an integer input, `ti` is an integer input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `fi` is an integer input, `ti` is an integer input**
