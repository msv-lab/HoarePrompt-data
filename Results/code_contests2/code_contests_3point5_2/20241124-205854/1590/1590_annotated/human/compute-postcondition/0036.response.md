Functionality: **The function `func` processes the information of passengers arriving at a building, sorts them based on the floor number and time of arrival, then calculates the order in which the passengers arrived. It does not accept any parameters. The function computes the total time passed based on the arrivals and departures of passengers, ensuring the time passed is adjusted correctly according to the passenger's schedule. The final output is the total time passed.**
