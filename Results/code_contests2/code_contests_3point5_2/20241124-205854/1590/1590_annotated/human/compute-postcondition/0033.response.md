Output State: **`time_passed` will be the maximum of the current `time_passed` and `p[i][1]` for each iteration of the loop. If `time_passed` is already greater than or equal to `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 0, the loop won't execute and `time_passed` remains 0.**
