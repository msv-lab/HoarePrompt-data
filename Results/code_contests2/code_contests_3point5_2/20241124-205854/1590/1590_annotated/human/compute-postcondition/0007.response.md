Example Answer:
A new tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are taken as input. The list `p` now contains an additional tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the updated list of tuples, `i` is 2, `fi` is an integer input, `ti` is an integer input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the updated list of tuples, `i` is 2, `fi` is an integer input, `ti` is an integer input**
