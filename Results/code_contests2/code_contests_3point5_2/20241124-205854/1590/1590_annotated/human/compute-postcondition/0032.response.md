According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `time_passed` and `i` are integers. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, `time_passed` is updated to the result of adding `p[i][1] - time_passed` to `time_passed` and `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to `time_passed` or `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be less than or equal to `n` after the adjustments.
State: **`time_passed`, `i` are integers with `i` less than or equal to `n`**
