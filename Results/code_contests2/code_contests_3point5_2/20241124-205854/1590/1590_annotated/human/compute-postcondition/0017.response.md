Example Answer:
The value of `time_passed` is increased by the difference between `s` and `p[i][0]`. The previous value of `time_passed` is 0, and `s` and `p[i][0]` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `time_passed` is increased by the difference between `s` and `p[i][0]`.
Output State: **`time_passed` is increased by the difference between `s` and `p[i][0]**
