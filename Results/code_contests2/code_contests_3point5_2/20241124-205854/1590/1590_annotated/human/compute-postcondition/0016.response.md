According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `time_passed` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`time_passed` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
