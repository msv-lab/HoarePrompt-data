According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the updated list of tuples, `i` is 2, `fi` is an integer input, `ti` is an integer input. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the updated list of tuples, `i` is 3, `fi` is an integer input, `ti` is an integer input**
