Example Answer:
`time_passed` is increased by the difference between the previous `s` and `p[i+1][0]` if `time_passed` was less than `p[i+1][1]`, for the next iteration of the loop. After execution, the value of `time_passed` is updated accordingly. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`time_passed` is increased by the difference between the previous `s` and `p[i][0] if `time_passed` was less than `p[i+1][1]` for the next iteration of the loop.**
