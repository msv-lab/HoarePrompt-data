Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned `p[i][0]`, where `i` is the index and `[0]` denotes the first element of the list `p`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The updated `time_passed` is calculated by subtracting `p[i][0]` from the previous value of `s`. 
Output State: **`time_passed` is the updated value after calculating `s - p[i][0]`, `i` is incremented by 1**
