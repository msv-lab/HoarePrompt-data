According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `time_passed` is updated to be the maximum of the current `time_passed` and `p[i][1]` if `time_passed` was less than `p[i][1]`. This ensures that `time_passed` is always equal to or greater than `p[i][1]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n + 1`.
State: **`time_passed` is updated to be the maximum of the current `time_passed` and `p[n][1]`, `i` is less than `n + 1`**
