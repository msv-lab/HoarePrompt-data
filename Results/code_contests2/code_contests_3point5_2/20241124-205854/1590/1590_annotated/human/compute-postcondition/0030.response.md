Example Answer:
`time_passed` is updated by calculating `p[i][1] - time_passed` and adding it to the previous value of `time_passed`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `time_passed` is the updated value after calculating `p[i][1] - time_passed`, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`time_passed` is the updated value after calculating `p[i][1] - time_passed`, `i` is incremented by 1**
