Example Answer: 
A new tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained from integer inputs, so the tuple contains the values entered by the user. The list `p` now contains an additional tuple with the values of `fi` and `ti` added to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the updated list of tuples with the newly appended tuple, `i` is 3, `fi` is an integer input, `ti` is an integer input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the updated list of tuples with the newly appended tuple, `i` is 3, `fi` is an integer input, `ti` is an integer input**
