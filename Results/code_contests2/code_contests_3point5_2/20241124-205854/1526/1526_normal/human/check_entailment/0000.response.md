Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. 
- The function reads a string `s` from user input and then counts the occurrences of each character in the string.
- It then checks if the count of each character is even, and if any count is odd, it sets the result to False.
- Finally, it prints 'Yes' if all character counts are even, and 'No' otherwise.

The code correctly determines if the given string `w` is beautiful, as it checks if each lowercase letter in the English alphabet occurs an even number of times. The code uses a dictionary to store the count of each character, then iterates over the values in the dictionary to check if they are all even. If any count is odd, the result is set to False, otherwise, it remains True. Finally, the code prints 'Yes' if all character counts are even, and 'No' otherwise. This logic aligns with the requirements of the problem description, making the code correct.
