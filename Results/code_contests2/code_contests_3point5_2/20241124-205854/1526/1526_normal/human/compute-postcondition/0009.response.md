Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string where `c` is the first character. If `c` is not already in `memo`, `memo[c]` is updated to 0. The string `s` still has at least 2 characters remaining. In all cases, the initial state of `s`, `c`, and `memo` is preserved, and `memo[c]` is set to 0 if `c` was not previously in `memo`.***
