Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is assigned the value `0`, where `c` is a key in the dictionary `memo`. The previous state of `memo[c]` is unknown, so after execution, `memo[c]` is set to `0`. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`s` is the substring of `s` starting from the second character to the end; `memo[c]` is 0**
