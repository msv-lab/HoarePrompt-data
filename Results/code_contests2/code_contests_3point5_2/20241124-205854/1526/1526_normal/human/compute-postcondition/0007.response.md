According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string where `c` is the first character, and `memo` is updated accordingly. To execute the loop one more time, the string `s` should still have at least one more character after `c` has been processed. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `s` should have at least 2 characters remaining.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string where `c` is the first character, and `memo` is updated accordingly, `s` has at least 2 characters remaining**
