According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. If there are more characters left in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is the substring of `s` starting from the second character to the end. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `s` must still have characters left after removing the first character. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is the substring of `s` starting from the third character to the end, if `c` is not present in `memo` then `memo[c]` is set to 0; otherwise, `memo[c]` is incremented by 1**
