According to the code, the loop can execute if there are values in the `memo` dictionary. Since it is specified that `s` is a non-empty string, we can assume that there will be at least one character in the `memo` dictionary. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `memo` should have at least one key-value pair.
State: **If `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` has at least one key-value pair, `s` remains the same, `c` is the last character in `s`, and `result` is set to True**
