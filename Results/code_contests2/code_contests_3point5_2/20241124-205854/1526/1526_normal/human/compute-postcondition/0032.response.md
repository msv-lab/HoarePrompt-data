Output State: **If `s` is a non-empty string, after the loop executes, `memo` contains the count of each character in `s`, `s` remains the same, `c` is the last character in `s`, and `result` is True. If any count of characters in `memo` is odd, `result` is set to False. If `s` is an empty string, `memo` remains an empty dictionary, and `result` is True.**
