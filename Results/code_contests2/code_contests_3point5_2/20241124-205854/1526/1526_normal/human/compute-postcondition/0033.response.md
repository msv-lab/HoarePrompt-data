Example Answer:
The loop counts each character in the non-empty string `s` and stores the count in the dictionary `memo`. If any count is odd, `result` is set to False. After the loop, `s` remains the same, `c` is the last character in `s`, and `result` is True. If `s` is empty, `memo` remains an empty dictionary, and `result` is True. The `print` statement prints 'Yes' if `result` is True and 'No' if `result` is False.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains the count of each character in `s`, `c` is the last character in `s`, `result` is True or False based on character counts in `memo`**
