Example Answer: 
`memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is not already a key in `memo`, then `memo` is updated to include `c` as a key with the value 0. If `c` is already a key in `memo`, then the value associated with `c` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string where `c` is the first character, and `memo` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string where `c` is the first character, and `memo` is updated accordingly**
