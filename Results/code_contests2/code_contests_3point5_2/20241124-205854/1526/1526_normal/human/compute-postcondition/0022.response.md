Postcondition: ***If `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` has at least one key-value pair, `s` remains the same, `c` is the last character in `s`, and `result` is set to True, then after the execution of the if statement, if `x` is an odd number, `result` is set to False. All other variables remain unchanged.***
