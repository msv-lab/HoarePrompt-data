Output State: **If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop iterates through each character in `s`, updating the `memo` dictionary with the count of each character. If `s` is an empty string, `memo` remains an empty dictionary. `s` remains the same, `c` is the last character in `s`, and `result` is set to True.**
