According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string where `c` is the first character, and `memo[c]` is updated to 1. To execute the loop one more time, the next character in the string `s` needs to be considered. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `s` should be the substring of `s` starting from the second character to the end.
State: **`s` is the substring of `s` starting from the second character to the end**
