Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads a string `s` from user input and then counts the occurrences of each character in the string. It then checks if the count of each character is even, and if any count is odd, it sets the result to False. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if all character counts are even, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters and returns a Yes or No output based on the character counts in the input string.**
