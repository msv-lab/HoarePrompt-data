Output State: **If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will iterate through each character in `s`. For each character `c`, the loop checks if `c` is not in the `memo` dictionary. If `c` is not in `memo`, then `memo[c]` is initialized to 0 and then incremented by 1. If `c` is already in `memo`, then `memo[c]` is simply incremented by 1. After the loop executes, `s` remains the same, `c` is the last character in `s`, and `memo` contains the count of each character in `s`. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `memo` remains an empty dictionary.**
