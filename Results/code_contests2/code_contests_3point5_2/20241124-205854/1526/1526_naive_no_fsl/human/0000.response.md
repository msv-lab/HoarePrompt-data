Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly reads the input string `w`, counts the occurrences of each character in the string, and then checks if each character occurs an even number of times. If any character occurs an odd number of times, the program sets `result` to `False` and prints 'No', otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. 
The program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases where a string is considered beautiful or not.
