Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input string and creates a dictionary to store the count of each lowercase letter. It then iterates through the values in the dictionary and checks if any of them have an odd count. If any value has an odd count, it sets the result to False, otherwise, it remains True. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if the result is True and 'No' if the result is False. This logic correctly follows the problem description and will determine if the given string is beautiful based on the condition provided.
