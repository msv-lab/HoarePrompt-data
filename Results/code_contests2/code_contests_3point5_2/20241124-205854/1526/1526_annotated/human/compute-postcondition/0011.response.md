According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the input string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `c` is the next character in `s`, and `memo` is a dictionary where `c` is a key with the count of `c`. To execute the loop one more time, the next character `c` should be the next character in `s`. The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `c` is the next character in `s`, and `memo` is a dictionary where `c` is a key with the count of `c`**
