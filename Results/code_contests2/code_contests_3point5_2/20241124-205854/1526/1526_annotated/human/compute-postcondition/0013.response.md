Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `c` is the next character in `s`, and `memo` is a dictionary where `c` is a key. If `c` is not already a key in `memo`, it is added to `memo` with a value of 0. In all cases, the state of the program ensures that `memo` contains `c` as a key with its corresponding count, which may be 0 if newly added or retain its previous value if already present.***
