According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is at least one value in the memo dictionary. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key with its count in the input string, `result` is a boolean. If x is odd, `result` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If x is even, `result` remains True. memo still has at least one value. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next value of x must exist in the memo dictionary.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key with its count in the input string, `result` is a boolean, and the next value of x exists in the memo dictionary**
