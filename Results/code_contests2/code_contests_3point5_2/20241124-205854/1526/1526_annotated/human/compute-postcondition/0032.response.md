Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key with its count in the input string, `result` is a boolean. If any value of `x` in `memo` is odd, `result` is set to False, and the loop terminates. If all values of `x` are even, `result` remains True. The loop will not execute if `memo` is an empty dictionary.**
