Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key with its count in the input string, `result` is a boolean. If x is odd, `result` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If x is even, `result` remains True. memo still has at least one value.***
