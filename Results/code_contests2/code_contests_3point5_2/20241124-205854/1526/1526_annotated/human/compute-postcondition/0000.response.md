Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string. The variable `w` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is an input string.
Output State: **w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is an input string**
