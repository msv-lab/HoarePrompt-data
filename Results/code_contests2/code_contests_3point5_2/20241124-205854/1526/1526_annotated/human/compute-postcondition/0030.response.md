Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key with its count in the input string. If the next value of `x` in the `memo` dictionary is odd, `result` is set to False, and the loop will not execute further. If the next value of `x` is even, the loop will continue.***
