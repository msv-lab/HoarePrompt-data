Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` was not in `memo` before, it is initialized to 0 and then incremented to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `c` is the next character in `s`, and `memo` is a dictionary where `c` is a key with the count of `c`.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `c` is the next character in `s`, and `memo` is a dictionary where `c` is a key with the count of `c`**
