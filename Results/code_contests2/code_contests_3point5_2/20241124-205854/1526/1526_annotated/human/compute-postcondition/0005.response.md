Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string, `memo` is a dictionary where `c` is a key initialized to 0 if `c` was not already in `memo`, `s` is not empty, and `c` is a character in `s`. After the execution of the if block, the state of the program ensures that `memo` contains the key `c` with a value of 0 if `c` was not previously present in the dictionary. All other key-value pairs in `memo` remain unchanged.***
