According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input string `s`. The loop can execute if `s` is not an empty string. Before the loop starts, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string, and `memo` is an empty dictionary. For the loop to execute, `s` should not be empty, and `c` should represent the characters in the input string `s`.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string, `memo` is an empty dictionary, `s` is not empty, `c` is a character in `s`**
