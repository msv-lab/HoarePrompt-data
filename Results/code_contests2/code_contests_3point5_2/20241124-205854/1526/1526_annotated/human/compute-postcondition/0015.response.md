According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the input string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `c` is the next character in `s`, and `memo` is a dictionary where `c` is a key with its count incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in the input string `s` should be the character following the current character, and the count of `c` in the `memo` dictionary should be incremented by 1.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `c` is the next character in `s` after the current character, and `memo` is a dictionary where `c` is a key with its count incremented by 1**
