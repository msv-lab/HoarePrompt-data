Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key with its count in the input string. If the value of `x` is odd, `result` is set to False and the program execution breaks. This ensures that `result` is only False when `x` is an odd number.***
