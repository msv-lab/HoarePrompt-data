According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If the value of `x` in the `memo` dictionary is even, the loop will continue. If the value of `x` is odd, the loop will not execute further. 

At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key with its count in the input string. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `x` in the `memo` dictionary must be even. No other states need adjustment.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key with its count in the input string, the next value of `x` in the `memo` dictionary is even**
