Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string. The next character in `s` is considered as `c`, and `memo` is a dictionary where `c` is a key. If `c` was not already in `memo`, `memo[c]` is initialized to 0 and then incremented by 1. This ensures that `memo` contains an entry for `c` with the correct count.***
