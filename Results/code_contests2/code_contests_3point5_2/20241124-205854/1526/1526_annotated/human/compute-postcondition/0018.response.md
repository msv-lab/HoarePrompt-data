According to the code, the loop can execute if the dictionary `memo` has at least one value (count of characters in `s`). So, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key with its count in the input string, `result` is True, and the dictionary `memo` has at least one value.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key with its count in the input string, `result` is True, `memo` has at least one value**
