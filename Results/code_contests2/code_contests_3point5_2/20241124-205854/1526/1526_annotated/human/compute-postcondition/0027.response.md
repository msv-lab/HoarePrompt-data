According to the code, the loop will execute for each value in the `memo` dictionary. If the value of `x` is odd, the program execution breaks and `result` is set to False. At the end of the previous iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key with its count in the input string. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next value in the `memo` dictionary should be considered. If the next value is even, the loop will execute again. If the next value is odd, then `result` will be set to False and the loop will not execute further.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key with its count in the input string. If the next value of `x` in the `memo` dictionary is even, the loop will execute again. If the next value of `x` is odd, `result` is set to False and the loop will not execute further.**
