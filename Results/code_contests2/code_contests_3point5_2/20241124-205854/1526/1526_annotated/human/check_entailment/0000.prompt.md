You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let w be a string consisting of lowercase letters. We will call w beautiful if the following condition is satisfied:

* Each lowercase letter of the English alphabet occurs even number of times in w.



You are given the string w. Determine if w is beautiful.

Constraints

* 1 \leq |w| \leq 100
* w consists of lowercase letters (`a`-`z`).

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


w


Output

Print `Yes` if w is beautiful. Print `No` otherwise.

Examples

Input

abaccaba


Output

Yes


Input

hthth


Output

No
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        
        memo[c] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string. `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key with its count in the input string. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute and `memo` remains an empty dictionary.
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key with its count in the input string, `result` is a boolean. If any value of `x` in `memo` is odd, `result` is set to False, and the loop terminates. If all values of `x` are even, `result` remains True. The loop will not execute if `memo` is an empty dictionary.
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
