Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines if a given string is beautiful based on the problem description. It counts the occurrences of each lowercase letter in the input string and then checks if each count is even. If any count is odd, it sets the result to False, otherwise, it remains True. The final output is "Yes" if the result is True and "No" if the result is False. The logic of the program aligns with the requirements of the problem statement.
