According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`, `l` is increased by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, `l` needs to be less than `k + 1`. Therefore, `l` needs to be incremented to the next value, which is `l + 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l+1]`, `l` is increased by 2**
