According to the code, the loop can execute if `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is updated by adding the value at index `l` in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains the same, `n, k` are assigned values from the input split by space, `k` is updated to `n - 1` if `k >= n`, `l` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to 4 since it's currently at 3.
