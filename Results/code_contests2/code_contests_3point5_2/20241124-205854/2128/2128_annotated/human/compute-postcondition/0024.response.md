Postcondition: ***`ans` is the first element in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains the same, `n, k` are assigned values from the input split by space. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is updated to `n - 1`. In all cases, the program variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition, with the exception of `k` potentially being updated to `n - 1` if the condition `k >= n` is met.***
