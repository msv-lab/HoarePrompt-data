According to the code, the loop can execute if `l` is less than `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l+1]`, `l` is increased by 2, `ans` is further increased by the value of `arr[l]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` needs to be less than `k + 1 + 2`, which simplifies to `l` less than `k + 3`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l+1]`, `l` is increased by 2, `ans` is further increased by the value of `arr[l], `l` is less than `k + 3`**
