According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is the first element in `arr` plus the element at index `l + 1` plus the element at index `l`, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains the same, `n, k` are assigned values from the input split by space, `k` is updated to `n - 1` if `k >= n`, `l` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` needs to be updated to `l + 1`.
State: **`ans` is the first element in `arr` plus the element at index `l + 1` plus the element at index `l`, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains the same, `n, k` are assigned values from the input split by space, `k` is updated to `n - 1` if `k >= n`, `l` is 3**
