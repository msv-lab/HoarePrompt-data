According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is greater than or equal to 1. The key condition is that `k` must be less than `n`, and if it is not, `k` should be updated to `n - 1`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`ans` is the first element in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains the same, `n, k` are assigned values from the input split by space, `k` is updated to `n - 1` if `k >= n`, `l` is 1**
