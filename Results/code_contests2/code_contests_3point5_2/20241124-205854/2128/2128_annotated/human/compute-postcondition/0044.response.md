Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of `arr`. The value of `ans` is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 2, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `l` is adjusted to the next value, `ans` corresponds to the first element in the sorted `arr`, and `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of `arr.
Output State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 2, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `l` is adjusted to the next value, `ans` corresponds to the first element in the sorted `arr`, and `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of `arr**
