Example Answer: 
`ans` is incremented by the value at index `l + 1` of `arr`. The value of `l` is increased by 1 before this operation. Therefore, after execution, `ans` is updated to include the value at index `l + 1` of `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 2, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `l` is adjusted to `l + 1`, `ans` corresponds to the first element in the sorted `arr`, and `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l + 1` of `arr**
