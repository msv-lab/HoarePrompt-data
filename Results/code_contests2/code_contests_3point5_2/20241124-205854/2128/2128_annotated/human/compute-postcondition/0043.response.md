According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 2, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `l` is adjusted accordingly, `ans` corresponds to the first element in the sorted `arr`, `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of `arr`. To execute the loop one more time, `l` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 2, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `l` is adjusted to the next value, `ans` corresponds to the first element in the sorted `arr`, `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of `arr**.
