The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for processing multiple test cases where each test case consists of n and k, with specific constraints as mentioned in the parameter constraints. The function will take these inputs, perform certain calculations based on the constraints provided, and then return the output specific to each test case. The return value will be the result of the calculations performed on the input values for each test case.
