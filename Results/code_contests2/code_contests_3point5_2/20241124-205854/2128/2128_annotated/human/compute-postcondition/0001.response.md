According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is assigned the value of the integer obtained from standard input reading. So for the loop to be executed `t` needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 0.
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
