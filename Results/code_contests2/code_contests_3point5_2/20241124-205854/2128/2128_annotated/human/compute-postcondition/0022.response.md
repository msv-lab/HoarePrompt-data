Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr`. Depending on the conditions mentioned, `ans` will either be the sum of the first `k + 1` elements in `arr` or remain the same as the first element. `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, and `n, k` are assigned values from the input split by space.
Output State: **`ans` is the first element in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains the same, `n, k` are assigned values from the input split by space**
