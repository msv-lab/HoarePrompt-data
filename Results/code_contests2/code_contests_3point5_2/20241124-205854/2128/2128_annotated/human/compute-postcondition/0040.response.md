Postcondition: ***`k`, `n`, `i`, `t`, `l`, `ans`, `arr` are all integers. `k` is updated to `n - 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is reassigned to `n - 1`. `i` is increased by 1. `t` remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are obtained from the input split by space. `l` represents the number of iterations of a loop, capped at `k`. `ans` corresponds to the first element in `arr`. `arr` is sorted in descending order.***
