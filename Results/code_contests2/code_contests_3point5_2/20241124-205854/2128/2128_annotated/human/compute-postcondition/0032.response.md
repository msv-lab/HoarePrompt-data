Output State: **If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the loop does not execute and `ans` remains the first element in `arr`. If `k` is less than `n`, then `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input split by space, `k` is updated to `n - 1` if `k >= n`, `l` is the number of iterations of the loop which is at most `k`**.
