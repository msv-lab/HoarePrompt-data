According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element and `k` is less than `n`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `t` should remain the same. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `arr` has at least 1 element and `k` is less than `n`, then `ans` is the sum of the first `k + 1` elements in `arr`. If `arr` is empty or `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` remains as the value of the first element in `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same**
