Output State: **If `arr` is not empty and `k` is less than `n`, then `ans` is the sum of the first `k + 1` elements in `arr`. If `arr` is empty or `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` remains as the value of the first element in `arr`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains as the first element in the sorted `arr`.**
