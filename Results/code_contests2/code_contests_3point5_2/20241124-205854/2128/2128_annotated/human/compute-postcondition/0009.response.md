According to the code, the loop can execute if and only if `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is less than or equal to the value of `n`. Additionally, `arr` being sorted in descending order indicates that `arr` has at least 1 element. Since `k` is updated to `n - 1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, we need to ensure that `k` is less than `n`. 

Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input from the standard input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr`, `k` is less than `n`**
