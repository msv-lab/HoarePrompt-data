According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 2, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `l` is adjusted to `l + 1`, `ans` corresponds to the first element in the sorted `arr`, and `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l + 1` of `arr`. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `l` should be less than `k + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 2, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `l` is `l + 1`, `ans` corresponds to the first element in the sorted `arr`, `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l + 1` of `arr, `l` is less than k**
