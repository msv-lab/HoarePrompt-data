Output State: **If `k` is greater than or equal to 1, then `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted `arr`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains as the first element in the sorted `arr`. `n` is at least 2, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `l` is adjusted accordingly.**
