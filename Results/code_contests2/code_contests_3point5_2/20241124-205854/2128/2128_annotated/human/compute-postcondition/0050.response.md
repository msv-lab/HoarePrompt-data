According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `i` is increased by 1, and `t` remains unchanged. The condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `i` should still be less than `t` after increasing by 1. So, `i` needs to be adjusted according to the condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `k` is greater than or equal to 1, then `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted `arr`. If `k` is less than 1, `ans` remains as the first element in the sorted `arr`. `n` is at least 2, `i` is increased by 2, `t` remains unchanged, `l` is adjusted accordingly.**
