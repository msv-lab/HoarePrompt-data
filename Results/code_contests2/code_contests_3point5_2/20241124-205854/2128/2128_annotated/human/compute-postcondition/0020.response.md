Output State: **If `arr` has at least 1 element and `k` is less than `n`, then `ans` is the sum of the first `k + 1` elements in `arr`. If `arr` is empty or `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` remains as the value of the first element in `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, and `n, k` are assigned values from the input split by space.**
