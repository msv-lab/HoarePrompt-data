According to the code, the loop can execute again if `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 2, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `l` is adjusted to the next value, `ans` corresponds to the first element in the sorted `arr`, and `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of `arr. To execute the loop one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to its next value, i.e., `l + 1`.
State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 2, `i` is increased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `l` is adjusted to `l + 1`, `ans` corresponds to the first element in the sorted `arr`, and `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l + 1` of `arr**
