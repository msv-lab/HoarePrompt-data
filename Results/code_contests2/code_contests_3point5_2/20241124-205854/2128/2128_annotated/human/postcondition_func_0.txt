The function `func` reads input from the standard input, processes multiple test cases involving n and k with specific constraints, calculates the sum based on the constraints provided, and prints the output for each test case. The function handles scenarios where k is less than n, k is greater than or equal to n, and k is less than 1 by adjusting the calculations accordingly.
