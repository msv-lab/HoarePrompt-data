Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the number of barrels, the number of pourings, and the initial amount of water in each barrel. It then sorts the barrels in descending order and calculates the maximum possible difference between the maximum and the minimum amount of water in the barrels based on the number of pourings allowed.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of pourings allowed is greater than or equal to the number of barrels, ensuring that the maximum possible difference is calculated correctly.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given examples.
