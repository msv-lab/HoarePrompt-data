The function reads an integer `t` from the standard input, then for each iteration up to `t`, it reads integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of integers `arr`. It sorts the `arr` list in descending order, calculates the sum of the largest element and the next `k` largest elements, and prints the result. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is reassigned to `n - 1` before calculating the sum. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
