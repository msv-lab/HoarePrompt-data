Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split(' '))`. The values of `n` and `k` depend on the input provided, and their previous values are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input.
Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input**
