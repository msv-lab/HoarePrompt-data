Example Answer: 
`ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. The value of `l` is 1, so `arr[l]` refers to the second element of the sorted `arr` in descending order. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, the second element is the second largest element. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by the second largest element of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is incremented by the second largest element of `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 1**
