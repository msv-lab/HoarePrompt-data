Output State: **If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute. If `t` is at least 1, for each iteration, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans` are updated based on the input values. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is reassigned to `n - 1`. `ans` is incremented by the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted `arr` list. The loop continues for `t` iterations, each time updating the variables accordingly.**
