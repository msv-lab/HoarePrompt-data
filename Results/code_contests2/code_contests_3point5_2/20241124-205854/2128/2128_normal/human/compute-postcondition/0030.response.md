Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by the third largest element of `arr` at index `l`. Since `arr` is already sorted in descending order, we can directly calculate the new value of `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` has been incremented by the second and third largest elements of `arr`, `i` has been incremented by 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` has been incremented by the second and third largest elements of `arr`, `i` has been incremented by 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order**
