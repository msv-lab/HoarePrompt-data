Example Answer:
The values of `n` and `k` are assigned by mapping integers from the input. The values of `k` and `n` are not directly related to the initial state, so they can be any valid integers. The variable `ans` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is incremented by 1**
