According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `l` is within the range of 1 to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k` is updated to `n - 1`, `t`, `i`, `arr`, `ans` are as described above. `l` is `k + 1`, which means the loop has completed all iterations up to `k`. To execute one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted so that it is within the range of 1 to `k`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `l`, which should be set to 1.
State: **`n`, `k` is updated to `n - 1`, `t`, `i`, `arr`, `ans` are as described above. `l` is 1**
