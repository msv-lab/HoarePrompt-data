According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the total number of iterations. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `t + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If k is greater than or equal to 1, ans will be incremented by the sum of the second to the k-th largest elements in arr. i will be incremented by the number of times the loop executes. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute and ans remains the same as the first element of arr. arr remains sorted in descending order. `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is less than `t + 1`**
