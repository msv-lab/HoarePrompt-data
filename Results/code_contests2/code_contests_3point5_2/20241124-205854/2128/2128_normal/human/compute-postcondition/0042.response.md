Output State: **`n`, `k` are assigned values from the input split by space, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is less than `t + 1`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values to integers and sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is reassigned to `n - 1`, `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` in the sorted `arr` list.**
