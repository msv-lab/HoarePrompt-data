Output State: **After the loop executes, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `arr`, `ans` are as described in the initial state. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is reassigned to `n - 1`. The loop increments `ans` by the value at index `l` in the sorted `arr` list for each iteration where `l` is less than `k + 1`. If `k` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains equal to the first element of `arr`.**
