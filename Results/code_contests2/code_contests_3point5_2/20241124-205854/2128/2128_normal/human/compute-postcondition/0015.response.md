According to the code, the loop can execute again if `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 3 and `k` is such that `1 <= k <= n`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to 4 to satisfy the condition `l` is less than or equal to `k`.
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input with `k` updated if necessary, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l] + arr[2] + arr[l]`, `l` is 4, `k` is such that `1 <= k <= n**
