According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` has been incremented by the second largest element of `arr`, `i` has been incremented by 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 2, and `ans` has been further incremented by the third largest element of `arr`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` has been incremented by the second largest element of `arr`, `i` has been incremented by 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 3, `ans` has been further incremented by the third largest element of `arr`**
