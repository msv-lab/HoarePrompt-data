According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `k` is greater than or equal to 1. So, the state needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, since the loop starts from 1, the variable `l` should be set to 1. 

State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 1**
