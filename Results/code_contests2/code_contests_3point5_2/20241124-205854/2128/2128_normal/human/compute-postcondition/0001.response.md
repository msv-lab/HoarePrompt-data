According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is a non-negative integer. Before the loop starts, `t` is assigned the integer value obtained from reading input using sys.stdin.readline(). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` needs to be a non-negative integer and `i` starts at 0.
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0**
