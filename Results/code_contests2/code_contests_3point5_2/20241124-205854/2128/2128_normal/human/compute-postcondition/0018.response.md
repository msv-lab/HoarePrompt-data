According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains the same as the initial value. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is incremented by 1**
