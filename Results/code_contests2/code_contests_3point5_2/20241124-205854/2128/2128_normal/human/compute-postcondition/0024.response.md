Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is updated to be n - 1. In all cases, the variable `ans` retains the value of the first element of `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, and `arr` remains sorted in descending order.***
