According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, `k` is such that `1 <= k <= n`. To execute one more time, `l` needs to be updated to 3 as it should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input with `k` updated if necessary, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l] + arr[2]`, `l` is 3, `k` is such that `1 <= k <= n**
