According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is incremented by the second largest element of `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is incremented by the second largest element of `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 2**
