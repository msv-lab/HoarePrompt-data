According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` has been incremented by the second and third largest elements of `arr`, `i` has been incremented by 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `k+1` because the loop condition is `l < k + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` has been incremented by the second and third largest elements of `arr`, `i` has been incremented by 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order**
