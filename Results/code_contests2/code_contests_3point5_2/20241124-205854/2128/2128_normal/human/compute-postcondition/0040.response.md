Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are assigned values from the input split by space, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is less than `t + 1`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values to integers, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is reassigned to `n - 1`. All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, with the specific case handled where `k` is equal to or greater than `n` being adjusted accordingly.***
