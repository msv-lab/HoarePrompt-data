Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 
1. The code does not account for the situation where all barrels have the same initial amount of water. In this case, the maximum possible difference between the maximum and minimum amount of water should be 0, as no pouring is needed. However, the code does not handle this scenario correctly.
2. The code does not consider the case where k = 0. In this case, the maximum possible difference should be the difference between the maximum and minimum initial amounts of water in the barrels. But the code does not handle this situation accurately.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
