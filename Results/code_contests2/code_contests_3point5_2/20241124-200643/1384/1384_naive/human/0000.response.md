Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes input for T (number of hours to study) and X (time passes faster in World B). It then calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B by dividing T by X. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and provides the expected output for all possible input values within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
