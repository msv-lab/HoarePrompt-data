Example Answer:
t and x are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string and converting them to float. The input is expected to be two space-separated integers. Since the values are positive integers, the output state is: t and x are positive float numbers with 1 <= t <= 100 and 1 <= x <= 100.
Output State: **t and x are positive float numbers with 1 <= t <= 100 and 1 <= x <= 100**
