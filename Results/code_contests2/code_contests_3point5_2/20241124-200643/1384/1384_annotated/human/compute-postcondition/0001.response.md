Example Answer:
The code snippet divides the value of `t` by the value of `x` and prints the result. Since `t` and `x` are positive float numbers, the division will result in a float value as well. Therefore, the Output State is: t and x are positive float numbers with 1 <= t <= 100 and 1 <= x <= 100.
Output State: **t and x are positive float numbers with 1 <= t <= 100 and 1 <= x <= 100**
