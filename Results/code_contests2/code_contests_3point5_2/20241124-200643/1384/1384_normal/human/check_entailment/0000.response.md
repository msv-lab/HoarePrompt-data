Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads two floating-point numbers from the user input, divides the first number by the second number, and prints the result. The code handles all possible cases mentioned in the problem description, such as T values between 1 and 100, and X values between 1 and 100. Additionally, the output hints are consistent with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct. Therefore, based on the code, description, and output hints, we can conclude that the program is correct.
