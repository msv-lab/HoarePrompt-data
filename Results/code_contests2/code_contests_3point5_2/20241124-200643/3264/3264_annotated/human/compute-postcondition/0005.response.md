Example Answer:
The code calculates two values: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. Since n is an odd number, both expressions will result in integer values. 
For the first expression, (n * n - 1) / 2 simplifies to (n^2 - 1) / 2, and for the second expression, (n * n + 1) / 2 simplifies to (n^2 + 1) / 2.
Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive odd integer within the range 3 to 10^9, and the two calculated values are (n^2 - 1) / 2 and (n^2 + 1) / 2.
Output State: **n is a positive odd integer within the range 3 to 10^9, and the two calculated values are (n^2 - 1) / 2 and (n^2 + 1) / 2**
