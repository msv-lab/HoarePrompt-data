Example Answer:
The code calculates two values: `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. Since n is an even number, the result of these calculations will be integers. For an even number n, `n * n / 4 - 1` will be equal to `(n^2 - 4) / 4`, and `n * n / 4 + 1` will be equal to `(n^2 + 4) / 4`. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer within the range 3 to 10^9, and n is an even number**.
