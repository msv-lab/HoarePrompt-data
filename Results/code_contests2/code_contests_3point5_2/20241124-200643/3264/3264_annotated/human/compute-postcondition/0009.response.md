Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9. If n is less than or equal to 2, -1 is printed. If n is odd within the range of 3 to 10^9, the two calculated values printed are ((n^2) - 1) / 2 and ((n^2) + 1) / 2. If n is even within the range of 3 to 10^9, the two calculated values printed are (n^2 / 4 - 1) and (n^2 / 4 + 1).***
