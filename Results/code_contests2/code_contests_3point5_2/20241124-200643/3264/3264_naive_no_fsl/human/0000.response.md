Correctness: False

For the input case of `6`, the program should output `8 10` according to the problem description. However, the program outputs `(print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1)`, which will actually result in a syntax error. The correct output should be `8 10`, so the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
