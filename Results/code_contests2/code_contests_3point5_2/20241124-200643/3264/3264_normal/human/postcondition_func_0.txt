The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, performs calculations based on the value of `n`, and prints the results. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is a positive odd integer larger than 2 and less than or equal to 10^9, it calculates and prints two values: ((n * n - 1) / 2) and ((n * n + 1) / 2). If `n` is a positive even integer larger than 2 and less than or equal to 10^9, it calculates and prints (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1). The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
