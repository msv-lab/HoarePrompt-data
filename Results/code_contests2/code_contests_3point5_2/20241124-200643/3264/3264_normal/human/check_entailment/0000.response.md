Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. When `n` is an odd integer larger than 2, the code attempts to print two values, but it does so incorrectly. Instead of using `print`, it uses parentheses which do not have any effect. The correct syntax for printing would be `print((n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)`. Similarly, when `n` is an even integer larger than 2, the code again incorrectly uses parentheses instead of `print`, resulting in incorrect output. The correct syntax would be `print(n * n / 4 - 1, n * n / 4 + 1)`. 

As a result, the code does not provide the correct output for the given problem description.
