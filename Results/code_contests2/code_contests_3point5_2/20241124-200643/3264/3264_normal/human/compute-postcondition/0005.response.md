Example Answer: 
The code calculates two values based on the input `n`: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. Since n is a positive odd integer larger than 2, the results of these calculations will be integers. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive odd integer larger than 2 and less than or equal to 10^9, and the two calculated values are (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2.
Output State: **n is a positive odd integer larger than 2 and less than or equal to 10^9, and the two calculated values are (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2**
