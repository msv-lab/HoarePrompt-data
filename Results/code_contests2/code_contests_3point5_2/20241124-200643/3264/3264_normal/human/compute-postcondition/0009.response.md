Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. If n is less than or equal to 2, -1 is printed. If n is a positive odd integer larger than 2 and less than or equal to 10^9, the two calculated values are ((n * n - 1) / 2) and ((n * n + 1) / 2). If n is an even positive integer larger than 2 and less than or equal to 10^9, the result of (n * n / 4 - 1) is printed, and the result of (n * n / 4 + 1) is printed.***
