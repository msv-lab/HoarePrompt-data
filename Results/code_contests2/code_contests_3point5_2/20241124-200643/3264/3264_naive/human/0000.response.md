Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program has syntax errors in the print statements. The correct syntax for printing should be `print()` instead of `(print)`. Additionally, the division operator `/` should be changed to `//` for integer division. The corrected program should look like this:

```
n = int(input())
if n <= 2:
    print(-1)
elif n % 2:
    print((n * n - 1) // 2, (n * n + 1) // 2)
else:
    print(n * n // 4 - 1, n * n // 4 + 1)
```

Therefore, the correctness is marked as **False** due to the syntax errors in the program.
