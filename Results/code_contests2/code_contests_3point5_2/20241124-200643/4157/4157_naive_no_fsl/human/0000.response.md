Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where two trolleybuses catch up with each other and travel together to the final station. The program only calculates the arrival time for each trolleybus independently without considering the possibility of trolleybuses catching up with each other.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 5 50
0 10
2 15
```

The correct output should be:
```
5.0
5.0
```

Explanation:
- Trolleybus 1: It takes 5 seconds to reach the final station with a maximum speed of 10 m/s.
- Trolleybus 2: It takes 5 seconds to reach the final station with a maximum speed of 15 m/s.

Both trolleybuses will travel together after 5 seconds and reach the final station at the same time. However, the given program will output incorrect results for this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the case where trolleybuses catch up with each other.
