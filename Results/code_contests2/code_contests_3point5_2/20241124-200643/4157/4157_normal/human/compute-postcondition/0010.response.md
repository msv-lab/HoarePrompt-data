Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, and `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `t`, `t1`, and `i` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1**
