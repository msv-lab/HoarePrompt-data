According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, and `i` is incremented by 1. To execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n+1` and `t` should be updated based on the new `t1 + ti` calculation. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n+1`**
