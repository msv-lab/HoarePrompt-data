Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. The values of `t1` and `ti` are float values from the input split. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n+1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n+1`, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from the input split.
Output State: **`t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n+1`, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from the input split**
