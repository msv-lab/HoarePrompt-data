Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters. It reads input for the number of iterations `n`, acceleration `a`, and distance `d`. Then, for each iteration, it calculates the maximum time `t` it takes for an object to reach its destination based on the given inputs. If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, a specific formula is used to calculate `t1`; otherwise, a different formula is used. The function updates `t` to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. The loop executes `n` times, updating `t` each time. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `t` remains at 0.0. The function does not return any value, but it prints the calculated `t` for each iteration. **
