Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned by mapping the integer values obtained from splitting the input. Since the initial state is not provided, we can assume the values are arbitrary. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values obtained from the input.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values obtained from the input**
