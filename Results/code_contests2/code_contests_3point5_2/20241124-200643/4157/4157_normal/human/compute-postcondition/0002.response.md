According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is 0.0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is now 0.
State: **`t` is 0.0, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values obtained from the input, `i` is 0**
