Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. The value of `t1` is calculated based on a conditional statement that is not provided. Since `t` is initially 0.0, the new value of `t` will be the maximum between `t1 + ti` and 0.0. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated to the maximum between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`.
Output State: **`t` is updated to the maximum between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`**
