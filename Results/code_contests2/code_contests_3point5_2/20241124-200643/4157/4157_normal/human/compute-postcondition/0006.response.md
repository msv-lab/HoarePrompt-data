Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to the maximum between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, but the initial values of `t`, `t1`, and `ti` are unknown. The code then prints the updated value of `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`.
Output State: **`t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`**
