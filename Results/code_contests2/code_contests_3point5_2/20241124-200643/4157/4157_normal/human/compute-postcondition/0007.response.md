According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1**
