Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes input for the number of trolleybuses, maximum acceleration, and the distance to the final station. Then, it iterates through each trolleybus, calculates the time it takes to reach the final station, and updates the maximum time taken so far. Finally, it prints the arrival time for each trolleybus.

The program correctly calculates the arrival time for each trolleybus based on the given constraints such as acceleration, maximum speed, and distance to the final station. It handles the scenario where trolleybuses catch up with each other and travel together. The logic provided in the code aligns with the problem description, and there are no missing edge cases or incorrect handling of inputs.
