The function does not accept any parameters. It calculates the total distance traveled by a moving object at different time intervals and prints the maximum total distance based on the given constraints. The code reads input values for `n`, `a`, and `d`, iterates over `n` time intervals, calculates `t1` based on the given formula, updates `t` as the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current `t`, and prints `t` after each iteration. The loop will not execute if `n` is 0.
