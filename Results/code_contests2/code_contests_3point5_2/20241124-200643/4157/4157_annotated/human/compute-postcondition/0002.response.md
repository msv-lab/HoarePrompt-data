According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is 0.0 does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so the state needs to be adjusted to `t` is 0.0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are assigned integer values from user input, and `i` is set to 0.
State: **`t` is 0.0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are assigned integer values from user input, `i` is 0**
