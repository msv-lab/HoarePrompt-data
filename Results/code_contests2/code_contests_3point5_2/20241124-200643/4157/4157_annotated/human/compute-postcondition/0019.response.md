The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the provided constraints and relationships. The function calculates the total distance traveled by a moving object at different time intervals and returns the total distance. The total distance is calculated by summing up the products of the velocity at each time interval and the difference in time between consecutive intervals. 
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It calculates the total distance traveled by a moving object at different time intervals and returns the total distance based on the given constraints.**
