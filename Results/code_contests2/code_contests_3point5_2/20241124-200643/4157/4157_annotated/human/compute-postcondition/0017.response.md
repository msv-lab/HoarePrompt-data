According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 which means `i` should be 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are assigned integer values from user input, `i` is 3, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from user input, `t1` is calculated based on the given formula, and `t` is printed**
