Example Answer:
`n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned values from the user input after splitting it. Since the initial state of `t` is not affected by the code snippet, the output state is: `t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values from user input.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values from user input**
