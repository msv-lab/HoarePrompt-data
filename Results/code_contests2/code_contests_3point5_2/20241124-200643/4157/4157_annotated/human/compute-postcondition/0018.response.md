Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are assigned integer values from user input, `i` is the current iteration of the loop, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from user input, `t1` is calculated based on the given formula, and `t` is printed after each iteration. The loop will not execute if `n` is 0.**
