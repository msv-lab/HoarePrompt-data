Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of trolleybuses, maximum acceleration, and distance to the final station.
2. It then iterates over each trolleybus, calculates the minimum time to reach the final station based on the given formula, and updates the maximum time taken by any trolleybus.
3. The program prints the calculated time for each trolleybus in the order they are given in the input.
4. The logic in the calculation of `t1` based on the provided formula seems correct according to the problem description.
5. The program handles the case when trolleybuses catch up with each other and travel together correctly.
6. Since the program logic aligns with the problem description and it covers the edge cases mentioned in the problem, the code can be considered correct.
