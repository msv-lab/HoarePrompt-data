Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values of N, Q, S, and the queries.
2. It correctly initializes the list P with zeros to store the number of occurrences of 'AC' up to index i.
3. It iterates through the string S and updates the P list based on the occurrences of 'AC'.
4. For each query, it calculates the number of 'AC' occurrences in the substring from index l to r and prints the result.
5. The logic of the program is correct and handles all possible cases of substring queries as described in the problem statement.
6. The program has a time complexity of O(N) for preprocessing the string and O(Q) for answering each query, making it efficient for large inputs.
