Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in each query substring of the input string. It initializes a list P with zeros and then iterates through the input string, updating the values in P based on whether the substring at that index contains 'AC'. Then, for each query, it calculates the difference between the values at the ending index and starting index of the substring to get the count of 'AC' occurrences in that specific substring. The program follows the problem description for every potential case, and there are no edge cases identified where it does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
