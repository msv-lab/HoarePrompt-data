Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input values N and Q as expected.
- It then processes the string S to calculate the cumulative count of occurrences of the substring 'AC' up to each index, which aligns with the problem description.
- The code correctly handles the queries by calculating the difference between the cumulative count at index r - 1 and index l - 1 in the list P, as required.
- There don't seem to be any edge cases or scenarios where the code deviates from the problem description based on the provided information.
- The output hints also match the code's functionality and support the conclusion that the code is correct.
