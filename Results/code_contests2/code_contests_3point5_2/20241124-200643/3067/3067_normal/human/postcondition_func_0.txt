The function `func` reads input values N and Q, then processes the string S to calculate the cumulative count of occurrences of the substring 'AC' up to each index. It then reads Q sets of integers l and r, and for each set, it prints the difference between the cumulative count at index r - 1 and index l - 1 in the list P. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely based on the predefined constraints and relationships within the code.
