Postcondition: ***N and Q are positive integers within the specified range, S is a raw input string, P is a list of length N + 1. If S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', then P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1, and i is incremented by 1. If S[i - 1:i + 1] != 'AC', then P[i] = P[i - 1], and i remains the same. If i is equal to 0, then P[0] is set to 0.***
