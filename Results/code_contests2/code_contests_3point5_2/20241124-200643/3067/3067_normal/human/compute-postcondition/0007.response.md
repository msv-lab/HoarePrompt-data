Postcondition: ***N and Q are positive integers within the specified range, S is a raw input string, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1, i is 0. If i is equal to 0, then P[0] is set to 0, and the program execution continues. The overall state after the if else block is that P[0] is set to 0, and the program continues.***
