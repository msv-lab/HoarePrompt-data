According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of N is at least 1. Before the loop starts, N is a positive integer within the specified range, so it already satisfies the loop condition. For the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted so that i starts at 0. 
State: **N and Q are positive integers within the specified range, S is a raw input string, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1, i is 0**
