Example Answer:
P is assigned a list of zeros with a length of N + 1. The values of N, Q, and S are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are positive integers within the specified range, S is a raw input string, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1.
Output State: **N and Q are positive integers within the specified range, S is a raw input string, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1**
