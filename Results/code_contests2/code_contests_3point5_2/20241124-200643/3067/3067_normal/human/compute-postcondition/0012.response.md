Postcondition: ***N and Q are positive integers within the specified range, S is a raw input string, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1, i is 0. If i is equal to 0, then P[0] is set to 0. After the if-else block executes, the overall state is that P[0] is set to 0. If S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', then P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1] + 1. If the condition is false, then P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1]. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios, ensuring the correct execution and state of the program variables.***
