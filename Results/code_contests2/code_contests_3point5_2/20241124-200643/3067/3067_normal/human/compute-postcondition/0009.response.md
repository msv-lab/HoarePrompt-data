Output State: **N and Q are positive integers within the specified range, S is a raw input string, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1, i is 0. If i is equal to 0, then P[0] is set to 0. After entering the if condition (S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC'), the overall state is that P[0] is set to 0. P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1] + 1.**
