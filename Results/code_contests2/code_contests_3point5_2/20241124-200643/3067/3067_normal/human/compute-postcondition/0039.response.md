Output State: **If N is greater than 0 and Q is greater than 0, the loop will execute Q times. After each execution, the loop will assign values to l and r from the input split, then print the difference between the cumulative count at index r - 1 and index l - 1 in the list P. The values of N and P remain unchanged throughout the loop. If N is 0 or Q is 0, the loop will not execute, and the values of l and r will not be assigned.**
