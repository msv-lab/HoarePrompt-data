Postcondition: ***N and Q are positive integers within the specified range, S is a raw input string, P is a list of length N + 1. If i equals 0, then P[0] is set to 0. Otherwise, P[i] is either incremented by 1 compared to P[i-1] if the substring S[i - 1:i + 1] is 'AC', or it remains the same as P[i-1].***
