Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly handles the input, processes the queries, and outputs the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' within the specified substrings of the given string. The logic used to update the P array based on the occurrences of 'AC' substrings is correct, and the queries are processed accurately by calculating the difference between the P values at the specified indices. The program covers all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.
