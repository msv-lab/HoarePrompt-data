Example Answer:
`P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros. The values of `N` and `Q` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: S is a string of length N consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', N and Q are integers such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, 1 <= Q <= 10^5, 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros.
Output State: **S is a string of length N consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', N and Q are integers such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, 1 <= Q <= 10^5, 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros**
