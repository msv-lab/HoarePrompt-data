Postcondition: ***S is a string of length N consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', N and Q are integers with 2 <= N <= 10^5, 1 <= Q <= 10^5, 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N. P is a list of length N + 1 where P[0] is set to 0. For each index i less than N, if the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1 is 'AC', then P[i] is incremented by 1 compared to P[i - 1]. Otherwise, P[i] remains the same as P[i-1]. This accounts for all possible scenarios and edge cases in the program.***
