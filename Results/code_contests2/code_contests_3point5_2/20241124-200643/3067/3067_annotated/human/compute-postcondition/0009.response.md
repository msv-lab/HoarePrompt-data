Output State: **S is a string of length N consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', N and Q are integers such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, 1 <= Q <= 10^5, 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, P is a list of length N + 1 filled with zeros. If i == 0, then P[0] is set to 0. In all other cases, the state of the program variables remains unchanged. Additionally, the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1 is 'AC'. P[i] is incremented by 1 compared to P[i - 1].**
