Output State: **S is a string of length N consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', N+1 and Q are integers with 2 <= N+1 <= 10^5, 1 <= Q <= 10^5, 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N+1. P is a list of length N + 2 where P[0] is set to 0. When i equals 0, P[0] is updated to 0 and the loop continues. All initial conditions are maintained after the execution of the if else block, covering all possible edge cases.**
