Postcondition: ***S is a string of length N consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', N and Q are integers such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, 1 <= Q <= 10^5, 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, P is a list of length N + 1 filled with zeros. If i == 0, then P[0] is set to 0. In all other cases, the state of the program variables remains unchanged.***
