Output State: **For each index i less than N, if the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1 is 'AC', then P[i] is incremented by 1 compared to P[i - 1]. Otherwise, P[i] remains the same as P[i-1]. If i is equal to 0, then P[0] is set to 0. The loop handles all possible scenarios and edge cases, including when N is less than 2, ensuring that the program variables are correctly updated.**
