According to the code, the loop can execute again if `_` is less than `Q`. At the end of the last iteration, N is greater than or equal to 2, P[0] is 0, l and r are assigned values based on user input, the difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1] is printed, Q is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be less than Q+1.
State: **N is greater than or equal to 2, P[0] is 0, l and r are assigned values based on user input, the difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1] is printed, Q is greater than 1, _ is less than Q+1**
