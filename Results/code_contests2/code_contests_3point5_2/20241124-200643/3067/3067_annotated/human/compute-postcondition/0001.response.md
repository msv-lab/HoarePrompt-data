Example Answer:
The variable `S` is assigned the value of the input string. The string `S` consists of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. The length of the string is denoted by `N`. The variables `N` and `Q` are integers. The conditions for `N` and `Q` are given as 2 <= N <= 10^5 and 1 <= Q <= 10^5. The conditions for `l_i` and `r_i` are 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N. Therefore, the Output State is: S is a string of length N consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', N and Q are integers such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, 1 <= Q <= 10^5, 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N.
Output State: **S is a string of length N consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', N and Q are integers such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, 1 <= Q <= 10^5, 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N**
