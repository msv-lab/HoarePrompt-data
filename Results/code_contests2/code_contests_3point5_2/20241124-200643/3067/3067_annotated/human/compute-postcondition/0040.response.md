The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to process a string `S` of length `N` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', along with two integers `N` and `Q` where 2 <= N <= 10^5, 1 <= Q <= 10^5. Additionally, the function will receive a series of queries represented by pairs of integers l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N. The function will process these queries and perform a specific task based on the input values.
