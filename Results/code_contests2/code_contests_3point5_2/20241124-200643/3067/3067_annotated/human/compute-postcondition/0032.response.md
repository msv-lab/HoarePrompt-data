According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value of Q. If Q is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, N is greater than or equal to 2, P[0] is 0, l and r are assigned values based on user input, and the difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1] is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, Q must be greater than 1.
State: **N is greater than or equal to 2, P[0] is 0, l and r are assigned values based on user input, and the difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1] is printed, Q is greater than 1**
