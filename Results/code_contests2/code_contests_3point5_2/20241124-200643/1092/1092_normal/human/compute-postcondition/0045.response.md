According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is not empty, `m` is increased to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is updated to the next word in `l`, `j` is the next element in `i`. If `j` is uppercase, `s` is increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is not empty, `m` is increased to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is updated to the next word in `l`, `j` is the next element in `i`. If `j` is uppercase, `s` is increased by 1**.
