Output State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is not empty, `m` is increased to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is updated to the next word in `l`, and `j` iterates over the elements of `i`. If at least one word in `i` is uppercase, `s` is increased for each uppercase word, and `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`. If all words in `i` are lowercase, there is no change in the state of the variables. If `i` is empty, the loop does not execute and `m` remains the same, `s` is 0.**
