According to the code, the loop can only execute if `i` is an iterable object. In this case, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, so it should be a string or a list to be iterable. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `i` should be a string or a list that is iterable. Additionally, since `m` and `s` are not used in the loop, they do not need to be adjusted.
State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is an iterable object (string or list), `m` is 0, `s` is 0**
