According to the code, the loop can execute again if the list `i` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: 
`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, 
`i` is not empty, 
`m` is increased to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, 
`s` is updated to the next word in `l`, 
`j` is the first element of `i`, 
`s` is updated to the next word in `l`, 
if the first element of `i` is an uppercase word, then `s` is increased by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- Ensure that `i` is not empty.
- Update `j` to the next element in `i`.
- Update `s` to the next word in `l`.
- Update `m` to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`.

State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is not empty, `m` is increased to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is updated to the next word in `l`, `j` is the next element in `i`**
