According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `i`. If there are more elements in `i`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` has more elements, `m` is increased to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is updated to the next word in `l`, and `j` is the next element in `i`. If `j` is in uppercase, `s` is increased by 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `m` should be updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`
- `s` should be updated to the next word in `l`
- `j` should be updated to the next element in `i`
- If the new `j` is in uppercase, `s` should be increased by 1

State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` has more elements, `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is updated to the next word in `l`, `j` is the next element in `i`. If `j` is in uppercase, `s` is increased by 1**
