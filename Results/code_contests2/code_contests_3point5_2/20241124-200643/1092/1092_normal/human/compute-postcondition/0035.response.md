According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is not empty. At the start of the loop, `j` iterates over the elements of `i`, so `j` should be set to the first element of `i`. Additionally, `s` should be updated to the next word in `l` to ensure the loop can execute. Since `m` is increased to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `m` should be updated accordingly. 
State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is not empty, `m` is increased to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is updated to the next word in `l`, `j` is the first element of `i`, `s` is updated to the next word in `l`**
