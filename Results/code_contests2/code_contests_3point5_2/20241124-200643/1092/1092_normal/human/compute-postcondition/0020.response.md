According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is not empty. Since `i` is an iterable object, it must contain at least 1 element for the loop to execute. Additionally, `s` is updated based on the next word in `l`, so `s` needs to be updated to the value of the next word in `l`. Finally, `j` will iterate over the elements in `i`, so `j` should be set to the first element of `i`.
State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is not empty, `m` is increased to be the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is updated to the next word in `l`, `j` is the first element of `i`**
