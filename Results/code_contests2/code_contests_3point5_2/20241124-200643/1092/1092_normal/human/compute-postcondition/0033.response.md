For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

1. `s` needs to be updated to the next word in `l`.
2. `m` needs to be increased to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`.
3. `j` needs to iterate over the elements of `i`.
4. If at least one word in `i` is uppercase, `s` needs to be increased for each uppercase word, and `m` needs to be updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`.
5. If all words in `i` are lowercase, there is no change in the state of the variables.
6. If `i` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `m` remains the same, `s` is 0.

State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is not empty, `m` is increased to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is updated to the next word in `l`, and `j` iterates over the elements of `i`.**
