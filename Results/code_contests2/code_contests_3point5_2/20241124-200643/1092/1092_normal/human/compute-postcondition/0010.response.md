Example Answer:
The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is an iterable object with more elements, `m` is 0.
Output State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is an iterable object with more elements, `m` is 0**
