Example Answer:
The `raw_input()` function reads a line of input from the standard input. Since there are no variables assigned to this input, the state of the program remains the same.
Output State: **Precondition: n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200. Each si (word) in the text consists of small and capital Latin letters.**
