According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is an iterable object, `m` has been updated based on the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`. If there exists a word `j` in `l` that is in uppercase, then `s` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the next word in `l` is in uppercase, then `s` should be increased by 1.
- `m` should be updated to be the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`.

State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is an iterable object, `m` is increased to be the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is updated based on the next word in `l`, and `i` is not empty.**
