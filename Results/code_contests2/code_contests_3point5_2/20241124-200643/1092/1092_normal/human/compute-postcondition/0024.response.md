According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is not empty, `m` is increased to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is updated to the next word in `l`, and `j` is the first element of `i`. If the first element of `i` is an uppercase word, then `s` is updated to the next word in `l`. 
So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should not be empty and the state of all other variables remains the same except for the update of `s` based on the condition mentioned above.
State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is not empty, `m` is increased to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is updated to the next word in `l`, and `j` is the first element of `i`. If the first element of `i` is an uppercase word, then `s` is updated to the next word in `l`.**
