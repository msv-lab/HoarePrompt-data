According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more elements in the iterable object `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is an iterable object with more elements, `m` is 0. If the word `j` in the list `l` is in uppercase, the value of `s` is incremented by 1. All initial conditions are retained after the execution of the if statement. So for the loop to execute one more time, the iterable object `i` must still have more elements, and the value of `j` should represent the next element in `i`.
State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is an iterable object with more elements, `m` is 0, `j` represents the next element in `i`**
