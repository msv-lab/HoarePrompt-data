According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `i` and the conditions stated in the loop. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word.
2. `i` is not empty.
3. `m` is increased to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`.
4. `s` is updated to the next word in `l`.
5. `j` is the next element in `i`. If `j` is uppercase, `s` is increased by 1.
State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is not empty, `m` is increased to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is updated to the next word in `l`, `j` is the next element in `i`. If `j` is uppercase, `s` is increased by 1**.
