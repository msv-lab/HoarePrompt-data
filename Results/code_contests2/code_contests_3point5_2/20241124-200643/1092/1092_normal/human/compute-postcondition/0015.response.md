According to the code, the loop executes for each element in the iterable object `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` has more elements, `m` is 0, `j` represents the next element in `i`, and `s` is incremented by 1 if the next element `j` is in uppercase. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `j` in `i` needs to be considered. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `j` should represent the element after the current `j` in `i`.

State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is an iterable object with more elements, `m` is 0, `j` represents the next element after the current `j` in `i`, `s` is incremented by 1 if the next element `j` is in uppercase**
