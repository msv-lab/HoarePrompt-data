Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the value of 0. The values of `l`, `i`, and `m` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `m` is 0, `s` is 0.
Output State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `m` is 0, `s` is 0**
