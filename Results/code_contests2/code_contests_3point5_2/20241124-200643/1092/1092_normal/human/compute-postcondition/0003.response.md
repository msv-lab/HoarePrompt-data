According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list `l` has at least 1 word, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `m` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list `l` must have at least 1 word, and `i` is the first word in the list.
State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `m` is 0**
