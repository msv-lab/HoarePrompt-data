Output State: **`l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is an iterable object (string or list), `m` is 0. If there exists a word `j` in `l` that is in uppercase, then `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0. If `i` is an empty string or list, the loop does not execute and `s` remains 0.**
