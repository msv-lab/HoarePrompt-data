According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i` and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `m` should be updated to be the maximum value between the number of uppercase characters in the first word of the list `l` and the current value of `m`.
- `s` should be updated to be the total number of uppercase characters in `i` increased by 1 if `j` is an uppercase character.
- `j` should be updated to the next character in the list `i`.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `m` is updated, `i` is updated, `s` is updated, `j` is updated**
