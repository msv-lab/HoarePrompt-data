According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `i` which is obtained by splitting the first word in list `l`. If `i` has more characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, `i` is a list of characters obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l` with more characters, `s` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the first character in the first word of list `l` is uppercase or not.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `i` must have more characters. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, `i` is a list of characters obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l` with more characters, `s` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the first character in the first word of list `l` is uppercase or not**
