According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If there are more iterations to be done, `j` should be a valid value in `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `l` remain unchanged, `m`, `i`, `s`, `j` are all updated. If `j` is an uppercase letter, `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to any variables. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `j` in `i` should be adjusted. If `j` is an uppercase letter, `s` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `l` remain unchanged, `m`, `i`, `s`, `j` are all updated. If `j` is an uppercase letter, `s` is increased by 1.**
