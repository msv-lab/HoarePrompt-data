Example Answer: 
`s` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. The values of `n`, `l`, `m`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `m` is updated, `i` is updated, `s` is updated by 1, `j` is updated.
Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `m` is updated, `i` is updated, `s` is updated by 1, `j` is updated**
