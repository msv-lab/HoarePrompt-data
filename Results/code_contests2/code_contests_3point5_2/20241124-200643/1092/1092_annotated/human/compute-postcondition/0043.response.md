Example Answer:
`s` is increased by 1. If `j` is an uppercase letter, `s` will be incremented by 1. The previous values of `n`, `l`, `m`, `i` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l` remain unchanged, `m`, `i`, `s` are updated, and if `j` is an uppercase letter, `s` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `l` remain unchanged, `m`, `i`, `s` are updated, and if `j` is an uppercase letter, `s` is increased by 1**
