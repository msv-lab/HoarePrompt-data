According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `i`. If `j` can iterate over `i` again, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `l` remain unchanged. `m`, `i`, `s`, `j` are all updated. If `j` is an uppercase letter, `s` is increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n`, `l` remain unchanged, `m`, `i`, `s` are updated. If the last `j` was an uppercase letter, `s` is increased by 1.**
