According to the code, the loop can only execute if the list `i` is not empty. Since `i` is obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l`, the loop can execute if the first word in the list `l` contains at least one character. Additionally, the loop execution depends on the values in `i`, so `i` should contain characters. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `i` is not empty, `s` is the number of uppercase characters in `i`, and `m` is the maximum value between the number of uppercase characters in the first word of the list `l` and the current value of `m`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing at least two words, `m` is the maximum value between the number of uppercase characters in the first word of the list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is a list of characters obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l`, `s` is the number of uppercase characters in `i`, `i` is not empty**
