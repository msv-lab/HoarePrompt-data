Example Answer:
The variable `m` is assigned the value of 0. Since no other variables are involved in this operation, the output state is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, l is a list containing n words, m is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, l is a list containing n words, m is 0**
