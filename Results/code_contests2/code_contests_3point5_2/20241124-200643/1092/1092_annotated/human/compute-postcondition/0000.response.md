Example Answer:
The function `raw_input()` reads the input from the user, but as there are no variables assigned to capture this input, the input is not stored or used further in the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **Precondition: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200. The text consists of n single-space separated words, each word consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.**
