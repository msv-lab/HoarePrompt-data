According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more words in the list `l` to iterate over. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer, `l` contains at least one word, `m` is the maximum value between the number of uppercase characters in the first word of the list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is a list of characters obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l`, `s` is the number of uppercase characters in `i`.

To execute the loop one more time, the list `l` must contain at least two words.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing at least two words, `m` is the maximum value between the number of uppercase characters in the first word of the list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is a list of characters obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l`, `s` is the number of uppercase characters in `i`.**
