According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l` and `i`. If `i` is not empty, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `m` is the maximum value between the number of uppercase characters in the first word of the list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is a list of characters obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l`, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in `i`, `i` is not empty, and `j` is an uppercase character. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must not be empty, and `j` must be an uppercase character.
State: **After the loop executes, `n` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `m` is the maximum value between the number of uppercase characters in the first word of the list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is a list of characters obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l`, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in `i`, `i` is not empty, `j` is an uppercase character**
