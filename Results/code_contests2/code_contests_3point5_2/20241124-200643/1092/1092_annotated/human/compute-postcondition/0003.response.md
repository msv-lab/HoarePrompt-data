According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `l` contains at least one word. The loop will iterate over each word in the list `l`. Before the loop starts, `n` being an integer between 1 and 200 ensures the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `m` is 0. So, for the loop to execute, `n` must be between 1 and 200, `l` must contain at least one word, and `i` is the first word in the list `l`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list `l`**
