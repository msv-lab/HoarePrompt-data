According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are still characters left in the list `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `l`, `m`, `i`, `s`, and `j` have specific conditions as mentioned. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, the list `i` must still have characters left after processing `j`, so `i` should not be empty. Additionally, if `j` is an uppercase character, the number of uppercase characters in `i` should be incremented by 1 or 2, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing at least two words, `m` is the maximum value between the number of uppercase characters in the first word of the list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is a list of characters obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l`, `s` is the number of uppercase characters in `i` incremented by 1 or 2 based on the case, `i` is not empty and contains more than 1 character with characters left after processing `j`, `j` is an uppercase character. If `j` is uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1 or 2 depending on the initial value of `s` and the final value of `s` is updated accordingly.**
