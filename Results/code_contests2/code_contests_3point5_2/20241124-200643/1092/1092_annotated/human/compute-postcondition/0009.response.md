According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more characters in the list `i` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, `i` is a list of characters obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l`, and `s` is 1. If `j` is an uppercase character, `s` is increased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `i` must have more characters to iterate over. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` should contain more characters for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, `i` is a list of characters obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l` with more characters, `s` is 1**
