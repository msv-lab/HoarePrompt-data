According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the list `i`. At the end of the last iteration, the number of uppercase characters in `i` was incremented by 1, so the loop can execute again if there are more characters in `i`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the number of characters in `i` such that it is greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing at least two words, `m` is the maximum value between the number of uppercase characters in the first word of the list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is a list of characters obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l`, `s` is the number of uppercase characters in `i` incremented by 1, `i` is not empty and contains more than 1 character, `j` is an uppercase character**
