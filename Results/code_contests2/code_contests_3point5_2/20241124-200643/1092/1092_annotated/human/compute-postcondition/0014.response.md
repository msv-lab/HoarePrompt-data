Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, `i` is a list of characters obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l` with more characters, `s` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the first character in the first word of list `l` is uppercase or not. If the condition `j.isupper()` is true, `s` is increased by 1, resulting in `s` being either 2 or 3***
