According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is not empty. Since `i` is a list of characters obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l`, it means the first word in the list `l` should not be empty. Additionally, the loop iterates over each character `j` in `i`, so `i` must contain characters for the loop to execute. Since `j` is an uppercase character, there must be at least one uppercase character in `i` for the loop to execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: the first word in the list `l` is not empty, `i` contains characters, and `i` contains at least one uppercase character.
State: **`n` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `m` is the maximum value between the number of uppercase characters in the first word of the list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is a list of characters obtained by splitting the first word in the list `l`, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in `i`, `i` is not empty, `j` is an uppercase character, `s` is 0, the first word in the list `l` is not empty, `i` contains characters, `i` contains at least one uppercase character**
