Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, splits the text into words, and calculates the volume of the text as the maximum number of capital letters in any word. It iterates through each word, counts the number of capital letters in each word, and keeps track of the maximum count encountered. Finally, it prints out the maximum count as the volume of the text. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and works as expected.
