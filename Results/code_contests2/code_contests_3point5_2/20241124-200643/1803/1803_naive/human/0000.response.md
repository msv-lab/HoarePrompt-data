Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly count the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set. It has several issues:
1. The program is using `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3, it should be replaced with `input()`.
2. The logic to extract the letters from the input string is incorrect. It only considers every 3rd character which will miss some letters.
3. The program does not handle the case when there are duplicate letters in the input set.

Example of incorrect behavior:
Input
{a, b, a, c}

Expected Output
3

Actual Output
2

The program fails to correctly count the distinct letters in the set when there are duplicates.
