Example Answer:
The variable `k` is assigned the value `1`. The variable `Cadena` and `Arreglo` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters enclosed in curly brackets, separated by commas and spaces, `Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters enclosed in curly brackets, separated by commas and spaces, `Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1**
