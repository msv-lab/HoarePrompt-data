Output State: **If the length of Cadena is greater than 2 and k is less than the length of Cadena, Arreglo will contain the elements at indices k, k+3, k+6, k+9, ..., k+(n*3) where n is the number of times the loop executed. Cadena will remain unchanged, k will be the last index accessed plus 3. If the length of Cadena is less than or equal to 2 or k is equal to or greater than the length of Cadena, the loop will not execute and Arreglo will remain an empty list, Cadena and k will retain their initial values. The code then prints the length of the list obtained after converting Arreglo to a set.**
