Example Answer: 
`k` is incremented by 3, and the previous value of `k` is 1, so after execution, `k` becomes 4. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters enclosed in curly brackets, separated by commas and spaces, `Arreglo` is a list containing the element at index 4 of `Cadena`, `k` is 4.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters enclosed in curly brackets, separated by commas and spaces, `Arreglo` is a list containing the element at index 4 of `Cadena`, `k` is 4**
