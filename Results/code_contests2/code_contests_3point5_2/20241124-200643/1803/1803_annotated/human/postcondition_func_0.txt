The function reads a string input `Cadena`, iterates over the characters in `Cadena` at specific indices, and stores them in a list `Arreglo`. The function then prints the count of unique elements in `Arreglo`. The loop will only execute if the length of `Cadena` is greater than 2 and `k` is less than the length of `Cadena`. If the loop does not execute, `Arreglo` remains empty. Additionally, if the loop executes, but the length of `Cadena` becomes less than or equal to 2 during the loop, it will stop prematurely. The function does not return any value.
