Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly count the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. It only considers every third character in the input string as a distinct letter, which is not a valid approach. Additionally, the program does not handle the case when the input string is empty. 

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input: {a, b, a, c}
Expected Output: 3
Actual Output: 2

The program fails to correctly count the distinct letters in the set in this case.
