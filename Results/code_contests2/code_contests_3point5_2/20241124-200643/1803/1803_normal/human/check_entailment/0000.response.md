Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is supposed to count the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set, but the implementation is incorrect. The code extracts elements from the input string `Cadena` based on a flawed pattern of incrementing the index `k` by 3 in each iteration. This approach does not correctly extract all the distinct letters from the input string, leading to an incorrect count.

For example, if the input is "{a, b, c, d}", the code will only extract "a" and "d" due to the flawed increment logic, resulting in an incorrect output of 2 instead of the expected 4.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description.
