Example Answer:
Cadena is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas and enclosed in curly brackets, Arreglo is an empty list, and k is assigned the value 1. Arreglo is concatenated with the element at index k of Cadena, which is 'a' in this case. Therefore, Arreglo becomes ['a']. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **Cadena is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas and enclosed in curly brackets, Arreglo is ['a'], k is 1**
