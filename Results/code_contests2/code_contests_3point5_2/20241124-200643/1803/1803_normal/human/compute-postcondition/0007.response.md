Example Answer:
`k` is incremented by 3, and the previous value of `k` is 4, so after execution, `k` becomes 7. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas and enclosed in curly brackets, `Arreglo` is ['a', 'Cadena[k]'], `k` is 7.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas and enclosed in curly brackets, `Arreglo` is ['a', 'Cadena[k]'], `k` is 7**
