Output State: **If the length of Cadena is greater than k and greater than 2, Arreglo will contain elements extracted from Cadena based on the k index incremented by 3 in each iteration. The loop will continue until the length of Cadena is no longer greater than k or 2. The final state will have Arreglo containing the elements extracted from Cadena and k will be the index value after the last iteration. If the length of Cadena is less than or equal to k or 2 initially, the loop will not execute and Arreglo will remain empty, k will be 1.**
