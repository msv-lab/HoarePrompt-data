The function `func` reads an input string `Cadena` representing a set of letters separated by commas and enclosed in curly brackets. It then extracts elements from `Cadena` based on a specific pattern and prints the number of unique elements in the extracted list. The function does not explicitly return any value, just prints the count of unique elements. The loop in the function extracts elements from `Cadena` based on the index `k` incrementing by 3 in each iteration, until the length of `Cadena` is no longer greater than `k` or 2. If the length of `Cadena` is less than or equal to `k` or 2 initially, the loop does not execute, resulting in an empty `Arreglo` list and `k` being 1.
