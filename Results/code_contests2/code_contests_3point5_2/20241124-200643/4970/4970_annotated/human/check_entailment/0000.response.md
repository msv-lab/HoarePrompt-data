Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program takes an integer input and uses it as an index to access a specific element from a predefined list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Since the input range is specified as 0 ≤ a ≤ 15, and the list has 16 elements, the program covers all possible input values and correctly outputs the corresponding element from the list. Hence, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
