Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program takes an integer input and then uses that input to index into a list of integers. The list contains values in the order specified in the problem description. Since the program simply indexes into the list based on the input integer and prints the corresponding value, it follows the problem description accurately. Additionally, since the input range is limited to 0 to 15, the program covers all potential cases within that range and correctly outputs the corresponding value from the list.
