Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes an integer input and prints the corresponding element from a list. The list contains elements in the order [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Since the input range is specified as 0 to 15, and the list index starts from 0, the program correctly maps the input to the corresponding element in the list. For example, if the input is 3, the output should be 13, which is correct according to the problem description. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected for all inputs in the specified range.
