Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes an integer input, converts it to an integer, and then prints the corresponding element from a predefined list. In this case, the input provided is 3, which corresponds to the index 3 in the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The element at index 3 is 13, which is correctly printed as the output. The code meets the problem description for this case. Since the program correctly handles the input provided in the problem description and gives the expected output, the correctness of the code is True.
