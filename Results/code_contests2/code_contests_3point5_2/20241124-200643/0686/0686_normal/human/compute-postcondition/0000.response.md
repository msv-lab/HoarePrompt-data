Initial State: n, m, a, b are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100.
```
n = n * a
m = m + b
```
Example Answer:
n is multiplied by a and m is increased by b. The values of n and m are within the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: n is updated based on the multiplication with a, m is updated based on the addition with b.
Output State: **n is updated based on the multiplication with a, m is updated based on the addition with b**
