The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with predefined integer variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` satisfying the constraints mentioned above. The function will return the result of the expression `(n // a) * (m // b)`, which represents the number of rectangles with sides of length `a` and `b` that can fit into a grid of size `n` by `m`. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the number of rectangles with sides of length `a` and `b` that can fit into a grid of size `n` by `m` and returns the result.**
