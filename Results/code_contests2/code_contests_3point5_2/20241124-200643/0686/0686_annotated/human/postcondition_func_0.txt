The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function should calculate a result based on values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, which are positive integers meeting specific constraints. However, since the function code is missing, it does not perform any calculations or operations as described in the annotations. The actual functionality of the function is unclear due to the absence of code logic.
