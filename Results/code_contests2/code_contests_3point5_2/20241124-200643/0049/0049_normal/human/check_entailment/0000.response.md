Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input integer `n` and the string `s`.
- It iterates through the string to check if any character is greater than its next character, as required by the problem description.
- If such a pair is found, it sets a flag to True and prints 'YES' along with the positions of those characters, which aligns with the problem requirements.
- If no such pair is found, it prints 'NO' as expected.
- The code handles the case where `n` is less than 2 by immediately printing 'NO', which is a valid scenario according to the problem description.
