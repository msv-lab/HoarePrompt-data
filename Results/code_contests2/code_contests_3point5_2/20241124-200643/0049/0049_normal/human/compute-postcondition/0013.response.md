According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as i is less than n - 1. At the end of the last iteration, n is at least 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, c is a lowercase Latin letter. If c[i] > c[i + 1], flag is set to True and pos is assigned the value of i. In all other cases, flag remains False and pos is not updated. i is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, i needs to be less than n - 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is at least 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, c is a lowercase Latin letter, flag is either True or False, pos is an integer, i is less than n - 1**
