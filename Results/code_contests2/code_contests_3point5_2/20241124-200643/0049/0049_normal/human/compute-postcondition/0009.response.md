According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a lowercase Latin letter. If `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, `flag` is set to True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. In all other cases, `flag` remains False and `pos` is not updated. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be updated. Since the loop condition is `i < n - 1`, `i` should be incremented by 1. 

State: **n is at least 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, c is a lowercase Latin letter. If c[i] > c[i + 1], flag is set to True and pos is assigned the value of i. In all other cases, flag remains False and pos is not updated. i is incremented by 1**
