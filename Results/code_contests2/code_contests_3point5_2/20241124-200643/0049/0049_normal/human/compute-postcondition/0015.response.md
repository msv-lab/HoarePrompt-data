Example Answer: 
`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, where `i` is less than `n - 1`. The value of `pos` will be less than `n - 1` as well. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a lowercase Latin letter, `flag` is set to True, `pos` is an integer less than `n - 1`, `i` is less than `n - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a lowercase Latin letter, `flag` is set to True, `pos` is an integer less than `n - 1`, `i` is less than `n - 1`**
