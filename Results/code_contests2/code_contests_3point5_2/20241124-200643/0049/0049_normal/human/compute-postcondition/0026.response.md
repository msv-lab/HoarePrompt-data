Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user input. It then iterates through the string to check if any character is greater than its next character. If such a pair is found, it sets a flag to True and prints 'YES' along with the positions of those characters. If no such pair is found, it prints 'NO'. However, the current implementation does not account for the case where `n` is less than 2, and the loop does not execute, which could lead to unexpected behavior.**
