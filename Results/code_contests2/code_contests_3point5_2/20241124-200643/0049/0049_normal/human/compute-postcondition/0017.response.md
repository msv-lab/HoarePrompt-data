According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a lowercase Latin letter, `flag` is either True or False, and `pos` is an integer. If `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, then `flag` is set to True and `pos` is updated to `i`. The conditions mentioned in the precondition are maintained after the execution of the program fragment. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` remains at least 2, `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `c` remains a lowercase Latin letter, `flag` remains either True or False, and `pos` remains an integer. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is at least 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, c is a lowercase Latin letter, flag is either True or False, pos is an integer**
