Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the map object created by applying the int function to each element after splitting the input string. Since the input method is incorrect and should be replaced with `input()` instead of `raw_input()`, the code will result in a syntax error. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5, and s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5, and s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
