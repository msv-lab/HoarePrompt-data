Output State: **n is at least 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, c is a lowercase Latin letter. If c[i] is greater than c[i + 1], then flag is set to True and pos is updated to i. In all other cases, flag remains False and pos is not updated. If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and flag remains False, pos is not defined.**
