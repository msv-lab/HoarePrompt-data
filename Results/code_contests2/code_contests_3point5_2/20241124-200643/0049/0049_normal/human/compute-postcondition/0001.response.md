Example Answer:
The code snippet takes the first character of the string `s` and assigns it to `n`. As `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `n` will now hold the first character of the string. 
Output State: **n is a lowercase Latin letter, s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters**
