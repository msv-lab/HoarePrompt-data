Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly checks if there exists a substring in the input string that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less. It iterates through the string and finds the first position where the character is greater than the next character. If such a position is found, it means there exists a substring that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less. The program then prints "YES" and the indices of the substring to be reversed. If no such position is found, it prints "NO". 

The logic implemented in the program is correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly handles the scenario where it is impossible to reverse any substring to obtain a lexicographically less string. Thus, the program is correct.
