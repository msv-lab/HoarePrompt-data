Correctness: False

The given program is incorrect. It does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description. 

For example, if the input string is "abcdefg", the program will output "NO" even though it is possible to reverse a substring to obtain a lexicographically less string (e.g., "ba" from indices 2 to 3). 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness false.
