The function `func` reads an integer `n` followed by a string `c` from the user input. It then iterates through the characters of the string `c` and checks if any character is greater than the next one. If such a character is found, it prints 'YES' along with the positions of the characters. If no such character is found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return any value.
