The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it is implied that the function has access to the variables `n` and `s` with the given constraints. The function is expected to process the string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, using its internal logic. The function does not explicitly return any value, but its purpose is to process the input string `s` based on the constraints provided.
