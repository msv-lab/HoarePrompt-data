According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `c` is a string value assigned from the input, `flag` is a boolean variable that is True if any character at position `i` in string `c` is greater than the character at position `i + 1`, and `pos` is assigned the value of `i` in this case. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains False and `pos` is not modified**.
