Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a string value assigned from the input, `flag` is a boolean variable that is True if any character at position `i` in string `c` is greater than the character at position `i + 1`, and `pos` is assigned the value of `i` in this case. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains False and `pos` is not modified.***
