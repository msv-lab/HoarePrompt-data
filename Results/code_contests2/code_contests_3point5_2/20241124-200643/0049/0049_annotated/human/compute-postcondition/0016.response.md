Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `c` is a string value assigned from the input. If the character at index `i` in string `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, then set `flag` to True and update `pos` to the index `i`. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains unchanged and `pos` retains its previous value.***
