Example Answer:
The value of `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, but the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so the output state remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `c` is a string value assigned from the input, `flag` is True, `pos` remains unchanged**
