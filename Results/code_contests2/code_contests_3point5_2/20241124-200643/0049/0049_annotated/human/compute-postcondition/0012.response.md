Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `c` is a string value assigned from the input. If the character at position `i` in string `c` is greater than the character at position `i + 1`, `flag` is True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. If this condition is not met, `flag` remains False and `pos` is not modified.***
