Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value `n[0]`, where `n` is a list of integers obtained from the input split. After executing the code, `n` now holds the first integer value from the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer extracted from the input list.
Output State: **`n` is an integer extracted from the input list**
