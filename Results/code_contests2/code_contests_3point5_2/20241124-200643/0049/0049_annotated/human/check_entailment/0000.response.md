Correctness: False

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. It only checks if there exists a character in the string that is greater than the next character, which is not the correct approach to solving the problem. The program should find a substring that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less, which this program does not do. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
