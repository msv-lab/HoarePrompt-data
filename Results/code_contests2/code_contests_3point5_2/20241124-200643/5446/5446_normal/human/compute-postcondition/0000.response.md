Example Answer:
`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on user input. The values are converted to integers using `int(x) for x in raw_input().split()`. Since the initial state is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `n`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the output state is: `n, a, b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b; n, b, c are user-input integers.
Output State: **n, a, b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b; n, b, c are user-input integers**
