Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the line `x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`. This line calculates the ratio of the maximum number of pieces in one cake to the minimum number of pieces in the other cake. However, the problem description does not require this calculation and this approach does not guarantee the correct distribution of cakes to plates.

For example, consider the input (4, 7, 10). According to the problem description, the correct output should be 3. However, the code will output 5 instead. This discrepancy shows that the code does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
