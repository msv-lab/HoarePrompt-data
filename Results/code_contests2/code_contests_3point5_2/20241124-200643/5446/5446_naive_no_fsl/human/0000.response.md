Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses variables `b` and `c` which are not defined. The input values should be assigned to `a` and `b` instead. Additionally, the `ceil` function is used without importing it from the `math` module. The program also does not follow the logic required to solve the given problem description.
