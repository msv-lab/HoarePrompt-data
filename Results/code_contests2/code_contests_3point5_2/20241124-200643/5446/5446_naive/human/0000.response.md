Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible number x as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the logic used to calculate x. The correct calculation should involve finding the minimum of the number of pieces of the first cake and the number of pieces of the second cake, then dividing it by the number of plates and taking the floor value of that division.

Here is an example where the program fails:
Input
4 7 10

Expected Output
3

For the above input, the correct output should be 3, but the program will output 2. This demonstrates that the program does not work as expected for all potential cases.
