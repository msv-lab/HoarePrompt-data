Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. The program calculates the minimum number of pieces on the plate incorrectly, which may lead to incorrect results. 

For example, if the input is 4 7 10, the program will output 2 instead of the correct output 3. This is because the program calculates x incorrectly by dividing the maximum number of pieces by the minimum number of pieces, which may not always give the correct result. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description.
