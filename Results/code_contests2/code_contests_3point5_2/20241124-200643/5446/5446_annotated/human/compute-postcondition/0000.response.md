Example Answer:
`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces. The input values are integers, and `n` is between 2 and the sum of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are integers satisfying the given conditions.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are integers satisfying the given conditions**
