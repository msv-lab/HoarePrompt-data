Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is calculated as the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`. Since `b` and `c` are integers, the division operation will result in a float value. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are integers satisfying the given conditions, and `x` is a float resulting from the division operation.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are integers satisfying the given conditions, `x` is a float**
