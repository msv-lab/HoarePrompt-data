The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the sum of the variables `a` and `b`, and then checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 2. If the sum is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the sum of variables `a` and `b`, and return True if the sum is greater than or equal to 2. If the sum is less than 2, it returns False.
