Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. The issue lies in the way the program handles the cyclic shifts of the input integer. The logic used in the program is incorrect for finding the minimum remainder of the division by the given number m among all good shifts.

For example, if we take the input:
```
5678901234567890123456789
10000
```
The program will output:
```
123
```
However, the correct output should be 0 as described in the problem statement. The program fails to correctly handle all the good shifts of the input integer and therefore does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.
