Postcondition: ***`a`, `m`, `c`, `copya`, `i`, `h`, `ans`, `b` are integers. If `a` modulo 10 is not 0, `h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10, `a` is updated by floor division by 10, and then `a` is recalculated based on the formula provided. `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. If `a` modulo 10 is 0, `h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10, and `a` is updated by floor division by 10. The program fragment ensures that the variables are updated accordingly based on the conditions provided, and the final state of the variables is determined by the specific conditions met during execution, encapsulating all possible edge cases.***
