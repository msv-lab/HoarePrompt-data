Example Answer:
`copya` is assigned the value of `copya` divided by 10. Since `copya` is the result of a division operation, it will be an integer. If `copya` was initially assigned the value of `a` divided by 10 and `copya` is not equal to 0, then after this operation, `copya` will be further divided by 10. The other variables remain the same.
