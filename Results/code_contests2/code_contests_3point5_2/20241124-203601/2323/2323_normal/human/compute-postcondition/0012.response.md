According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 100 and is updated by dividing itself by 10. This means that `copya` will eventually reach 0 when the digits of `a` are exhausted. Therefore, the loop will execute one more time if `copya` is not equal to 0 at the end of the previous iteration.
