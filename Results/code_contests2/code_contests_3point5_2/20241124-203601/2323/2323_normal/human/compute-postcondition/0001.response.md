Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is Stepan's integer is a positive integer with no leading zeros, m is a positive integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, a is the input integer provided by the user, b is an input integer.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with no leading zeros, m is a positive integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, a is the input integer provided by the user, b is an input integer.**
