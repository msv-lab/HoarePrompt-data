According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 100 and `copya` is not equal to 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be adjusted to a value that is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
