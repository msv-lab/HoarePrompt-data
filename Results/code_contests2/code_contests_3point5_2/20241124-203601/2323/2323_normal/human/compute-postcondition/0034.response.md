Postcondition: ***`a` is updated based on conditions, `m` is between 2 and 10^8, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. In the if part, if `a % 10` is not equal to 0, `h` is assigned the remainder of `a` divided by 10, `a` is updated by floor division by 10, then modified by multiplying by 10 raised to the power of `c` and adding `h`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between itself and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. In the else part, `h` is assigned the remainder of `a` divided by 10, `a` is updated by floor division by 10, and no further modifications are made to `ans`. This postcondition handles all possible scenarios and edge cases for the execution of the if else block.***
