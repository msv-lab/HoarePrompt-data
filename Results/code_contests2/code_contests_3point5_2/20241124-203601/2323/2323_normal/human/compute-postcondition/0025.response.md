Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `m` is between 2 and 10^8, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `i` is 0. If a % 10 != 0, `a` is updated to be 10^c * h + a, where `c` is greater than 0, `h` is the remainder of the previous `a` divided by 10; `m` is between 2 and 10^8, `copya` is 0, `i` is 0; and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the result of a % b. If a % 10 == 0, `a` is an integer obtained after removing the last digit of the previous `a`, `m` is between 2 and 10^8, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `i` is 0, `h` is the new last digit of `a`.***
