Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` will be the input provided by the user, which is a positive integer with no leading zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with no leading zeros, m is a positive integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, a is the input integer provided by the user.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with no leading zeros, m is a positive integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, a is the input integer provided by the user**
