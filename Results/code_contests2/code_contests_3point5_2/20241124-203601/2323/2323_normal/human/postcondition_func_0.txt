The function `func` reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user input. It calculates the number of digits in `a` and stores it in `c`. Then, it iterates through the digits of `a`, updating `a`, `ans`, and `h` accordingly. The function finally prints the value of `ans`. There is a missing part in the annotations related to the case when `a` is not a positive integer or `m` is not between 2 and 10^8, which should be considered in the functionality description.
