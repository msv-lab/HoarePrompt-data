Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the logic used to update the integer `a` by moving the last digit to the front. The program incorrectly calculates the cyclic shifts of the integer and does not consider all possible good shifts.

An example where the program fails is for the following input:
```
1001
5
```
The correct output should be `0`, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will output a different value due to incorrect logic in handling the cyclic shifts.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not produce the correct output for all potential cases according to the problem description.
