According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is true. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, and `c` is 3, and `copya` is true. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we simply need to keep `copya` as true.
State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is true**
