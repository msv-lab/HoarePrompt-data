Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by floor division of `copya` by 10. The value of `copya` changes based on its previous value, which is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is updated based on the previous value.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is updated based on the previous value**
