Output State: **If copya is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, after the loop executes, a will be a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits, b will be an input integer, c will be the number of digits in copya, copya will be 0. If copya is 0, the loop will not execute, and c will be 0 as well. The loop iterates through the digits of a, updating a by moving the last digit to the front under certain conditions, and updating ans with the minimum value between the current ans and a % b.**
