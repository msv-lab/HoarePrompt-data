Postcondition: ***`copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2 or greater, `h` is the last digit of `a`. If a % 10 != 0, `a` is updated by removing its last digit and adding it to the front multiplied by 10 raised to the power of `c`. `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. If a % 10 == 0, `a` is updated by removing its last digit and adding it to the front multiplied by 10 raised to the power of `c`.***
