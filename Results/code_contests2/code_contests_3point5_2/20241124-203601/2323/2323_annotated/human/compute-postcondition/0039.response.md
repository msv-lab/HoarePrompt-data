Example Answer: 
The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. Since `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 199,999 digits and `b` is an input integer, the remainder of `a` divided by `b` can be any value between 0 and `b-1`. Therefore, the minimum value between the current `ans` and this remainder is calculated and stored in `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 199,999 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is greater than 2, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `ans` is updated accordingly**
