Example Answer:
The value of `a` is divided by 10, so the last digit is removed. Since `a` is a positive integer, this operation will reduce the number by one digit. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 199,999 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 199,999 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
