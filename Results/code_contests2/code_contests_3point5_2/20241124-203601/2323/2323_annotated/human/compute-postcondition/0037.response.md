Example Answer:
The value of `a` is divided by 10. The previous value of `a` was a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits. After the division, the length of `a` will decrease by 1 digit. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 199,999 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is greater than 2, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `ans` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 199,999 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is greater than 2, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `ans` is updated accordingly**
