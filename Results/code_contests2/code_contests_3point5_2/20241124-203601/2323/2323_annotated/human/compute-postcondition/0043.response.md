Postcondition: ***`copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 199,999 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is greater than 2, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `ans` is updated accordingly. If `a % 10` is not equal to 0, `h` is set to the last digit of `a`, `a` is updated by moving the last digit to the front and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `a % b`. If `a % 10` is equal to 0, `h` is set to the last digit of `a`, `a` is updated by moving the last digit to the front. After the execution of the if else block, `copya`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `h`, and `ans` are in the described state with the respective conditions met.***
