Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated to be `10 ** c * h + a`, where `c` is an input integer, and `h` is the last digit of `a` after dividing by 10. The value of `copya` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is updated to a new value based on the calculation, `b` is an input integer, `c` is greater than 2, `h` is the last digit of `a` after dividing by 10, `ans` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is updated to a new value based on the calculation, `b` is an input integer, `c` is greater than 2, `h` is the last digit of `a` after dividing by 10, `ans` is updated accordingly**
