Postcondition: **`copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1. If the last digit of `a` is not 0, then `h` is the last digit of `a`. In this case, `a` is updated by moving the last digit to the front and `ans` is updated with the minimum value between the current `ans` and `a % b`. If the last digit of `a` is 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`, and `a` is updated by moving the last digit to the front.**
