Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`, where `c` is the input integer `b` and `h` is the last digit of the previous value of `a`. The output state will be: `copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2 or greater, `h` is the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2 or greater, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
