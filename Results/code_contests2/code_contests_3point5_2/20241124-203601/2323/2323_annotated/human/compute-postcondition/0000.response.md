Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits. Therefore, the Output State is: a is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits.
Output State: **a is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits**
