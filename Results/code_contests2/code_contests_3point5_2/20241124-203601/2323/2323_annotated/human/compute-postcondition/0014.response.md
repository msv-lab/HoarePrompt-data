Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is calculated as the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. However, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: If copya is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, then after the loop executes, a is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, b is an input integer, c is the number of digits in copya, copya is 0. If copya is 0, the loop will not execute, and c will be 0 as well.
Output State: **If copya is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, then after the loop executes, a is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, b is an input integer, c is the number of digits in copya, copya is 0. If copya is 0, the loop will not execute, and c will be 0 as well.**
