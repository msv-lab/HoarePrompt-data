Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `10 ** c * h + a`, where `c` is 1 and `h` is the last digit of `a`. The value of `a` is updated based on the formula provided. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits divided by 10, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
