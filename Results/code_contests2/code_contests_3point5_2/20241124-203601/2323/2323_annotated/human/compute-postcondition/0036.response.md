Example Answer: 
The value of `h` is calculated as the remainder of `a` divided by 10. This gives us the last digit of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is greater than 2, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `ans` is updated accordingly.
