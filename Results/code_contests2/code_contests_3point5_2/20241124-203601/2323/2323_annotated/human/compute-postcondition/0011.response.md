Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 2. After execution, `c` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is true.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is true**
