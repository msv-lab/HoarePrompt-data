Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits. `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits. `b` is an input integer**
