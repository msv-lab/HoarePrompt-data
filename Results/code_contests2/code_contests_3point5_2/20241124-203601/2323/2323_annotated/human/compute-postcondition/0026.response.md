According to the code, the loop will execute `c` times. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `c` needs to be incremented by 1
- If the last digit of `a` is not 0, then `h` will be the last digit of the updated `a`
- `a` will be updated by moving the last digit to the front
- `ans` will be updated with the minimum value between the current `ans` and `a % b`
- If the last digit of the updated `a` is 0, `h` will be the last digit of the updated `a`

State: **`copya` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `a` is a positive integer with a length between 1 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2 or greater**
