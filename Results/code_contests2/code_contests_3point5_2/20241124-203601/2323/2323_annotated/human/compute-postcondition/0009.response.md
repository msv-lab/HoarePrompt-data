According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `copya` is true. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and `copya` is true. Since `copya` is a boolean variable that controls the loop, it needs to remain true for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is true**
