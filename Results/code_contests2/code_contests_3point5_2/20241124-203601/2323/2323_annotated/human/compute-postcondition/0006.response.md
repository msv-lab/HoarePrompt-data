According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is true, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is updated based on the previous value. So, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be true. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `a` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is true**
