Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads two input strings and calculates the number of '1's in each string. It then compares the counts and prints "YES" if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to the count of '1's in the second string, otherwise it prints "NO". This logic aligns with the problem description provided, as it determines if it is possible to turn the first string into the second string using the given operations. The program covers all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the comparison of '1's in the two strings.
