Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the parity of strings a and b by counting the number of '1's in each string. It then compares the parity values and prints 'YES' if the parity of a is greater than or equal to the parity of b, and 'NO' otherwise. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and produces the correct output based on the given rules.
