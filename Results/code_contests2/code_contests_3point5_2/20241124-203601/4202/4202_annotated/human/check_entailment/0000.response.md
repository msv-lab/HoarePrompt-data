Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads two input strings, calculates the parity of '1's in each string, and then compares the parities to determine if it is possible to turn string a into string b. The logic of the program is correct as it follows the problem description for all potential cases. The program outputs "YES" if it is possible to turn a into b and "NO" otherwise, as specified in the problem description. The code handles all edge cases and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
