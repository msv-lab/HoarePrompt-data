Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the next character input is '1', and the previous value of `pb` is 1. Therefore, after execution, if the next character input is '1', `pb` will be 2, otherwise, it will remain 1. The state of `pa` is not affected. 
Output State: **`pa` is 0, `pb` is 2 if the next character input is '1', `pb` is 1 if the next character input is not '1'**
