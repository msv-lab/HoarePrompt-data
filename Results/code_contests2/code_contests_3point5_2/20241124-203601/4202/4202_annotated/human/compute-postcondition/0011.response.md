Example Answer: 
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the first character input from raw_input() is '1'. The initial value of `pb` is 0, and the initial value of `i` is the first character input from raw_input(). Therefore, if the first character input is '1', `pb` will be 1 after execution. 
Output State: **`pa` is 0, `pb` is 0 if the first character input is not '1', `pb` is 1 if the first character input is '1'**
