According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided by the user when prompted by `raw_input()`. The loop will execute as long as there is at least one character input by the user. So, for the loop to execute, the `pa` should be adjusted to indicate that there is at least one character input.
State: **`pa` is at least 1**
