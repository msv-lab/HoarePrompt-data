According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input provided by the user. If there is more input available, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is at least 1, and it is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `pa` needs to be adjusted to at least 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`pa` is at least 2**
