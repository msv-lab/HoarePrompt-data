According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string. If there are more characters in the input string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is 0, `pb` is 0 if the first character input is not '1', `pb` is 1 if the first character input is '1'. To execute the loop one more time, the input string must have more characters. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`pa` is 0, `pb` is 0 if the first character input is not '1', `pb` is 1 if the first character input is '1'**
