According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is another character input. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is 0, `pb` is 2 if the next character input is '1', `pb` is 1 if the next character input is not '1'. So for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted based on the next character input. If the next character input is '1', then `pb` needs to be adjusted to 2. If the next character input is not '1', then `pb` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **`pa` is 0, `pb` is 2 if the next character input is '1', `pb` is 1 if the next character input is not '1'**
