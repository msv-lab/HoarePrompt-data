Example Answer:
The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The previous value of `pa` is at least 1, and the value of `i` is not specified. If `i` is '1', then `pa` will increase by 1, otherwise, `pa` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is at least 1.
Output State: **`pa` is at least 1**
