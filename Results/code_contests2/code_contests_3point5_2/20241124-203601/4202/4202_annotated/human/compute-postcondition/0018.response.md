Example Answer:
The code prints 'NO' if `pa` is greater than or equal to `pb`, otherwise it prints 'YES'. As `pa` remains 0 throughout and `pb` is the count of occurrences of '1' in the input string, the comparison result depends on the input string. Since the initial state does not provide information about the input string, the output state cannot be determined accurately.
Output State: **Cannot be determined accurately**
