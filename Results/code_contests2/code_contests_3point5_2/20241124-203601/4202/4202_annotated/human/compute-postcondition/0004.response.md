Example Answer: 
The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The previous value of `pa` is at least 1, and the value of `i` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `pa` is at least 1, and it is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'.
Output State: **`pa` is at least 1, and it is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'**
