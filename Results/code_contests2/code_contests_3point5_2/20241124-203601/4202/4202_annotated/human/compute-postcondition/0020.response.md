Functionality: **The function `func` reads two strings from user input and counts the occurrences of '1' in each string. It then prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to the count in the second string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return a value.**
