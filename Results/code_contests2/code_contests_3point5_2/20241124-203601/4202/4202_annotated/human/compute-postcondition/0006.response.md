Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'. The initial state of `pa` is at least 1. If `i` is '1', `pa` will be incremented by 1, otherwise, `pa` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is at least 1, and it is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'.
Output State: **`pa` is at least 1, and it is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'**
