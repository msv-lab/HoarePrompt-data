Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The initial state of `pb` is 0 if the first character input is not '1' and 1 if the first character input is '1'. Therefore, after execution, the value of `pb` will be 1 if the first character input is '1' and 1 or 0 otherwise.
Output State: **`pa` is 0, `pb` is 1 if the first character input is '1', `pb` is 0 if the first character input is not '1'**
