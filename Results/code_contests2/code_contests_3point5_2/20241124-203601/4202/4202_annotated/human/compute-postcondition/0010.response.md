According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `raw_input()`. If there is at least one character input, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `pa` is 0 and `pb` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, `raw_input()` should have at least one character, and `i` should be the first character input.
State: **`pa` is 0, `pb` is 0, `i` is the first character input from raw_input()**.
