According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input provided. If there is more input available, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is 0, `pb` is 1 if the first character input is '1', `pb` is 0 if the first character input is not '1'. For the loop to execute one more time, there should be more input available to iterate through.
State: **`pa` is 0, `pb` is 1 if the next character input is '1', `pb` is 0 if the next character input is not '1'**
