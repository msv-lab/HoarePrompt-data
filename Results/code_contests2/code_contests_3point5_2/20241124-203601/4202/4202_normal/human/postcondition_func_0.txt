The function `func` reads two input strings of 01-characters of lengths between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). It counts the occurrences of '1' in each string, then prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to the count in the second string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value directly.
