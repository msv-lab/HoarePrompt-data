Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads two input strings of 01-characters of lengths between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), counts the occurrences of '1' in each string, and then prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to the count in the second string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The code covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description. The examples provided in the description are also correctly handled by the code. Therefore, the code is correct.
