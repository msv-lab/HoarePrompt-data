Example Answer:
The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the character represented by `i` is '1'. Variables `pa`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `pa` is 0, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` represents each character in the input string, `pb` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string.
Output State: **`pa` is 0, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` represents each character in the input string, `pb` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string**
