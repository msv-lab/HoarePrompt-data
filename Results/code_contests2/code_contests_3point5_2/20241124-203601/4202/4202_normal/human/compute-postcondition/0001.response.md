According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is at least 1 character in the input. Since the input is not specified, we need to ensure that there is at least 1 character in the input for the loop to execute. The initial state should be adjusted to indicate that there is at least 1 character in the input and i is now the first character in the input string.
State: **a and b are strings of 01-characters with lengths between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), pa is 0, there is at least 1 character in the input, i is the first character in the input string**
