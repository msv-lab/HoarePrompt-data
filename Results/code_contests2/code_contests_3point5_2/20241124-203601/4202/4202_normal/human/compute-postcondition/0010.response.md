According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the input provided by the user using `raw_input()`. Since `raw_input()` will provide a string of characters, the loop will execute for each character in the input. Before the loop starts, `pa` is 0, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. To ensure the loop executes, `i` should represent each character in the input string. So, to modify the state:
State: **`pa` is 0, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` represents each character in the input string**
