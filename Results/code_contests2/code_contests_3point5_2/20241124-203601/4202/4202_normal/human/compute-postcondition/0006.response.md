Example Answer:
Initially, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the second character in the input string is '1', while `a` and `b` remain unchanged. After executing the code snippet `pa += i == '1'`, the value of `pa` will be incremented by 1 if the second character in the input string is '1'. The states of `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`pa` is incremented by 1 if the second character in the input string is '1', `a` and `b` remain unchanged**
