Example Answer:
`pb` is assigned the value 0. There are no changes to the variables `pa`, `a`, or `b` based on the given code snippet. If the input string is empty, `pa` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is 0, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`pa` is 0, `a` and `b` remain unchanged**
