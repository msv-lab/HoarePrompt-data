Example Answer: 
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the first character in the input string `i` is '1'. The lengths of strings `a` and `b` are between 1 and 1000 characters inclusive. The previous values of `pa`, `a`, and `b` are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is incremented by 1 if the first character in the input string is '1', `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`pa` is incremented by 1 if the first character in the input string is '1', `a` and `b` remain unchanged**
