Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of doors and the sequence in which Mr. Black opened the doors.
2. The program iterates over the sequence of opened doors and finds the smallest index `k` such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first `k` doors.
3. The logic inside the for loop checks if the current door and the next door are located in different exits, and updates the answer accordingly.
4. The program outputs the correct value of `k` as required by the problem description.
5. The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that Mr. Black is able to exit the house after opening the doors in the correct sequence.
