Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `c` is a list of integers. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` and the program breaks out of the loop. This condition covers scenarios where the list `c` has different values at index `i` and `i + 1`, and in such cases, `ans` is set to `i + 1` before exiting the loop.***
