According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 2 for the loop to execute. Additionally, the initial value of `i` should be set to `n - 2`. 
State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`**
