Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `n`. If the first element in the list `n` is either 0 or 1, then `n` will be assigned that value. The state of the list `c` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is either 0 or 1, `c` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is either 0 or 1, `c` remains unchanged**
