According to the code, the loop can execute until `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`. If the element at index `i` in list `c` is not equal to the element at index `i+1`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` and the program breaks out of the loop. If the condition is not met, the program continues without any changes to the variables. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be at least 3 and the condition mentioned above should not be met.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
