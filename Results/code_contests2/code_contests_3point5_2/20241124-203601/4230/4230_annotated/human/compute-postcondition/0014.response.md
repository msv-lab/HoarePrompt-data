Example Answer: 
The value of `ans` is calculated as `i + 1`, where `i` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is at least 1, the value of `ans` will be at least 2. The other variables `n` and `c` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `c` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is at least 2.
Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `c` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is at least 2**
