Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, c is a list of integers, ans is n - 1, i is n - 2. If the element at index i in list c is not equal to the element at index i+1, then ans is updated to i + 1 and the program breaks out of the loop. If the condition is not met, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
