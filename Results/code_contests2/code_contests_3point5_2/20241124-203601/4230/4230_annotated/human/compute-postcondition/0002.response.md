Example Answer: 
`c` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since `c` is unchanged in the initial state, after executing the code, `c` will be assigned a list of integers obtained by mapping the input function to the split raw input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is either 0 or 1, `c` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is either 0 or 1, `c` is a list of integers**
