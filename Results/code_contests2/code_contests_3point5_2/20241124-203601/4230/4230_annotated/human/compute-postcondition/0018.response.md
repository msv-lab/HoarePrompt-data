Output State: 

If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. In this case, `ans` remains 0, and the values in list `c` are not relevant. If `n` is at least 2, the loop iterates over the elements in list `c` starting from the second last element. If the element at index `i` is different from the element at index `i + 1`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` and the loop breaks. The final output state will have `n` at least 2, `c` as a list of integers, and `ans` containing the last index where the elements in `c` are different.
