According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `c` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than or equal to 1**
