Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the smallest index k such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first k doors. It iterates through the sequence of opened doors in reverse order and checks if the door in the current position is in a different exit than the next door. If it finds such a door, it updates the answer with the current index. This logic ensures that the program finds the smallest index where Mr. Black can exit the house based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output.
