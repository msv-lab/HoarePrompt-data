Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the logic to find the smallest index k such that after Mr. Black opened the first k doors, he was able to exit the house. The code reads the input, iterates over the doors from right to left, and checks for the first change in door location. Once a change is found, it sets the answer to the index of that change and breaks out of the loop. This approach ensures that the code follows the problem description for every potential case as it accurately determines the index at which Mr. Black can exit the house based on the door openings. Additionally, the output hints align with the code's functionality, reinforcing the correctness of the program.
