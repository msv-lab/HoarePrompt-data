According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `ans` is `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 3`, and `c` is a list of elements. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n - 4`.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `ans` is `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 4`, `c` is a list of elements**
