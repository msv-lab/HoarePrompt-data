Example Answer: 
The variable `ans` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `n` is the first element of the original list `n`, which is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the first element of the original list `n`, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is the first element of the original list `n`, `ans` is 0**
