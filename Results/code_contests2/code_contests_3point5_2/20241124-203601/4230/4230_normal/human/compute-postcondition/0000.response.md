Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the result of mapping integers converted from input split by spaces. The input is not specified, so the exact values cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000. c is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 representing the location of the door (left exit or right exit)**, `n` is a mapped list of integers from input.
