Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, and `i` is `n - 3`, so after execution, `ans` becomes `n - 3 + 1` which simplifies to `n - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `ans` is `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 3`, `c` is a list of elements.
Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `ans` is `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 3`, `c` is a list of elements**
