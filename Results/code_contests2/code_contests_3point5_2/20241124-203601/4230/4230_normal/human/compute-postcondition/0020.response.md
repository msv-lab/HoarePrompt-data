The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the predefined constraints. It takes into account the integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 200,000 and the list `c` of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 representing the location of the door (left exit or right exit). The function does not return any specific value, but it operates on the input parameters `n` and `c` to perform a certain functionality.
