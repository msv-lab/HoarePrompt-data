According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Since `n` is the first element of the original list `n`, it implies that the original list has at least 3 elements. 
Before the loop starts, `ans` is 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 3 and `i` is `n - 2`.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`**
