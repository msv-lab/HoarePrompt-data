Output State: **If n is less than 3, the loop does not execute. If n is at least 3, the loop iterates through the elements of list c in reverse order. For each iteration, if the element at index i is not equal to the element at index i + 1, then ans is updated to i + 1, and the loop terminates. After the loop, ans will hold the index of the first element where the value changes, i will be the index of the last checked element, and c will remain unchanged.**
