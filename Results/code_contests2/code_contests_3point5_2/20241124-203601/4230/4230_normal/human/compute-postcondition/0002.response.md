Example Answer: 
`c` is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element of the input split by spaces. Since `n` is the first element of the original list `n`, the value of `n` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of the original list `n`.
Output State: **`n` is the first element of the original list `n`**
