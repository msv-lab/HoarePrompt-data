According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `ans` is n - 1, `i` is n - 2. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to n - 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `ans` is n - 1, `i` is n - 3, `c` is a list of elements**
