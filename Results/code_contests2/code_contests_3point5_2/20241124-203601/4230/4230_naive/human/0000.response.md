Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly iterates through the doors opened by Mr. Black and finds the smallest index k such that he can exit the house after opening the first k doors. The logic used in the program aligns with the problem description and works for all potential cases. The program correctly handles the scenario where Mr. Black opens the doors alternatively from left and right exits until all doors are open and he can exit the house.
