The function `func` reads an input string, splits it into two parts, compares those parts, and if they are equal integers, initializes `ans` to 1. Then, it iterates through a range of integers between A and B (exclusive), checks if the first and fifth digits are equal, and if the second and third digits are equal, incrementing `ans` accordingly. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not have any parameters and does not return any value.
