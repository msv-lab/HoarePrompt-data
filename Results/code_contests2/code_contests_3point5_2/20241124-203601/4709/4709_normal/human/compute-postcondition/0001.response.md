Example Answer:
The string `a` is split into a list `l` based on spaces. Since the initial state of `a` contains the input value of lowercase English letters, splitting it will create a list `l` containing the individual words or characters. 
Output State: **`a` contains the input value of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list created by splitting `a`**
