Postcondition: ***`a` contains the input value of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list created by splitting `a`, `A` is the first element of list `l`, `B` is the second element of list `l`, `ans` is initialized to 1 if `A` and `B` are integers with the same value. The program state remains unchanged if `A` and `B` are not integers or have different values.***
