According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `A` and `B`. The loop will execute if both `A` and `B` are integers and have the same value. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `A` and `B` must be integers with the same value. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `A` and `B` are integers with the same value.
State: **`a` contains the input value of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list created by splitting `a`, `A` is an integer with the same value as `B`, `B` is an integer with the same value as `A`, `ans` is initialized to 1**
