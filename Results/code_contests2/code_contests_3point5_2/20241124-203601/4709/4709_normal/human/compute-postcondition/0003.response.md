Example Answer:
`B` is assigned the value of the second element of list `l`. The value of `l` is created by splitting `a`, and `A` is assigned the first element of list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` contains the input value of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list created by splitting `a`, `A` is the first element of list `l`, `B` is the second element of list `l`.
Output State: **`a` contains the input value of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list created by splitting `a`, `A` is the first element of list `l`, `B` is the second element of list `l`**
