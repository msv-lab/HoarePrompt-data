Postcondition: ***`a` contains lowercase English letters, `l` is a list created by splitting `a`, `A` and `B` are integers with the same value, `ans` is an integer initialized to 1, `C` is a list of characters converted from the string representation of `i`. If the first and fifth elements of `C` are equal and the second and third elements of `C` are equal, then `ans` is incremented by 1. The state of the program after the if statement executes covers all cases where the conditions are met, ensuring the correctness of the increment operation on `ans`.***
