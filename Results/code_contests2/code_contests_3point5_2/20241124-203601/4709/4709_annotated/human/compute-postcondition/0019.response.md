Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, so the new value of `ans` is increased by 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` consists of 3 lines, each containing 3 lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of 3 strings where A is the first string and B is the second string incremented by 1; `ans` is an integer increased by 1.
Output State: **`a` consists of 3 lines, each containing 3 lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of 3 strings where A is the first string and B is the second string incremented by 1; `ans` is an integer increased by 1**
