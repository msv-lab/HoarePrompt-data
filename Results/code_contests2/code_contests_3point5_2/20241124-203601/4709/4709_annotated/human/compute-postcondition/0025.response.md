Functionality: The function reads input from the user, splits it into a list, assigns values to variables A and B, and initializes ans to 0. If the integer value of A is equal to the integer value of B, ans is set to 1. Then, it iterates through a range of integers from A to B (excluding B), checks if the first and last digits of each integer are the same, incrementing ans accordingly. Finally, it prints the value of ans. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
