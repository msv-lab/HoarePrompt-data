Postcondition: ***`a` consists of 3 lines, each containing 3 lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of 3 strings where A is the first string and B is the second string; `ans` is an integer. If the characters at index 0 and 4 of the third line in `a` are equal, and the characters at index 1 and 3 of the third line in `a` are equal, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables `a`, `l`, or `ans`.***
