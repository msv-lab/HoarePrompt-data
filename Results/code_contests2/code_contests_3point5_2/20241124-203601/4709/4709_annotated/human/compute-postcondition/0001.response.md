Example Answer:
The variable `l` is assigned the result of splitting the input `a` into a list of strings. Since `a` consists of 3 lines, each containing 3 lowercase English letters, `l` will be a list of 3 strings, each string containing the letters from each line. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the raw input consisting of 3 lines, each containing 3 lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of 3 strings.
Output State: **`a` is the raw input consisting of 3 lines, each containing 3 lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of 3 strings**
