Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The program is trying to compare integer values of strings, which is not the requirement of the problem. Additionally, the loop condition `range(int(A), int(B))` will not work as intended for the given input format of lowercase English letters.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not correctly extract the letters on the diagonal connecting the top-left and bottom-right corner of the grid.
