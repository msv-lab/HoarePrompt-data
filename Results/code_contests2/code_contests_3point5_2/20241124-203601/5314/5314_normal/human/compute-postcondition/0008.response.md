According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is reduced by 86400 - `int(a[i])`. This reduction means that for the loop to execute again, the new value of `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the adjustment needed is to ensure that the new value of `t` is greater than 0.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `t` <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 2, and `t` is reduced by 86400 - `int(a[i]) and the new value of `t` is greater than 0**
