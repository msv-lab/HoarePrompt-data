Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 1**
