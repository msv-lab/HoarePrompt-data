According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is positive. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 1.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1**
