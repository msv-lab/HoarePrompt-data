Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned the values extracted from the list returned by `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`. The values of `n` and `t` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6**
