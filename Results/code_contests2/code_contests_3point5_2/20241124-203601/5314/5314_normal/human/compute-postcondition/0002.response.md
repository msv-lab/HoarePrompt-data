Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value 0. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 0**
