According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has been reduced by 86400 - `int(a[i]) and the new value of `t` is greater than 0. So, to make sure the loop can execute one more time, the new value of `t` should still be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `t` <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 3, and `t` is reduced by 86400 - `int(a[i]) and the new value of `t` is greater than 0**
