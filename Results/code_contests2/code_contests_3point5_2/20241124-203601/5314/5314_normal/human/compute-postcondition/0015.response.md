Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n` and `t`, then reads a list of values `a`. It iterates through the list `a`, subtracting each element from 86400 from `t` until `t` becomes non-positive. The function then prints the final value of `i`, which represents the number of elements processed from the list `a` before `t` became non-positive. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
