Output State: **If the sum of 86400 - int(a[i]) for each i from 0 to n is greater than t, then t will become negative after the loop finishes. If t is initially less than 86400 or if the sum of 86400 - int(a[i]) for each i from 0 to n is less than or equal to t, the loop will not execute at all. In the end, t will be the difference between the sum of 86400 - int(a[i]) for each i from 0 to n and the initial t value. The value of i will be equal to n.**
