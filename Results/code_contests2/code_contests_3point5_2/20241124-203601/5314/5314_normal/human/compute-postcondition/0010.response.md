Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The other variables remain the same as their values are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `t` <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 3, and `t` is reduced by 86400 - `int(a[i]) and the new value of `t` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `t` <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 3, and `t` is reduced by 86400 - `int(a[i]) and the new value of `t` is greater than 0**
