Example Answer: 
The value of `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 from the integer value of `a[i]`, where `i` is 0. The value of `a[i]` is not given in the initial state, so the output state is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 0**
