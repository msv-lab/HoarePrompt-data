Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

While the code correctly iterates through the list `a` and subtracts each element from 86400 from `t`, it does not handle the case where Luba finishes reading the book exactly on the last second of the day. In such a scenario, the code should not increment the day count `i` because Luba finishes reading on the same day. 

For example, if the input is:
```
2 2
86400 86398
```
The expected output should be 2 because Luba finishes reading on the second day. However, the code will output 3 because it increments `i` one more time even though Luba finishes reading on the second day.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle the case where Luba finishes reading exactly on the last second of the day.
