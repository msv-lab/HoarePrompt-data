Correctness: **False**

In the given program, the logic used to determine the minimum day Luba can finish reading the book is incorrect. The program deducts the time spent on work from the total time required to read the book until the remaining time is greater than zero. This approach does not consider the fact that Luba can carry over the remaining time to the next day if she finishes reading early.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 4
3600 3600
```
Expected Output: 2

In this case, Luba can finish reading on the first day itself, but the program will output 2 as it does not consider carrying over the remaining time to the next day.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases and is incorrect.
