Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The while loop logic is incorrect as it does not take into account the case where Luba has free time left to read after completing her work for the day. Additionally, the program does not consider the case where Luba finishes reading on the last day. 

An updated version of the program with the correct logic is as follows:

```python
def func():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    days = 0
    for i in range(n):
        t -= (86400 - a[i])
        if t <= 0:
            days = i + 1
            break
    
    if t > 0:
        days = n + t // 86400
    
    print(days)

func()
```

This updated program considers the case where Luba can spend her remaining time reading if she finishes work early. It also accounts for the scenario where Luba finishes reading on the last day.
