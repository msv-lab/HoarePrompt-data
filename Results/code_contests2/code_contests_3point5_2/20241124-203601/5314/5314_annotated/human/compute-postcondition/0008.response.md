According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is updated, and `i` is 2. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is updated and greater than 0, `i` is 2**
