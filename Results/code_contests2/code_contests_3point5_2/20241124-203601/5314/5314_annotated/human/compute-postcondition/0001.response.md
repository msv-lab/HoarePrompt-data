Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list. The values of `n` and `t` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6**
