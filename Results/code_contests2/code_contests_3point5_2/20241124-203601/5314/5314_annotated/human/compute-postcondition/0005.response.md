According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `t` are positive integers, `n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is between 1 and 10^6, and `i` is 1. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the value of `t` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^6, `i` is 1, and `t` is greater than 0**
