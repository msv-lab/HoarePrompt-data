Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. The values of `n` and `t` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. The output state is: n and t are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6.
Output State: **n and t are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6**
