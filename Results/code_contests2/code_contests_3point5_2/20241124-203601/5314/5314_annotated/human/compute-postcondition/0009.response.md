Example Answer: 
The value of `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 - int(a[i]), where `a` is an array. The value of `n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than 0, and `i` is 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is updated and greater than 0, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is updated and greater than 0, `i` is 2**
