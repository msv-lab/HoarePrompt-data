Example Answer:
`t` is updated by subtracting 86400 - `a[i]`, where `a` is an array and `i` is 1. The value of `t` is greater than 0, so the result of the subtraction will be less than `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is updated, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is updated, `i` is 1**
