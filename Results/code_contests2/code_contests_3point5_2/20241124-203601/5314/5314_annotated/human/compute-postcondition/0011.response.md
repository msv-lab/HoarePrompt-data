According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is updated and greater than 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` should remain greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is updated and greater than 0, `i` is 3**
