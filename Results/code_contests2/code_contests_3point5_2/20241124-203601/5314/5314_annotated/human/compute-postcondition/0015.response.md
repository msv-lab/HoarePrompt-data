Functionality: **The function reads an integer n and a list of n non-negative integers representing time values in seconds. It then iterates over the list subtracting each element from 86400 until the total time t becomes non-positive. The function prints the number of iterations i. If the initial value of any element in the list a is greater than 86400, the loop will not execute for that element.**
