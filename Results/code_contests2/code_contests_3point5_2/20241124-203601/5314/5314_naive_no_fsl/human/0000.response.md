Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where Luba finishes reading the book before the given number of days. In such a scenario, the program will result in an index out of range error since it does not check if `i` exceeds the number of days `n`. 

For example, if the input is:
```
2 2
0 0
```
The program should output `1` as Luba finishes reading the book on the first day itself. However, the given program will result in an index out of range error. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description.
