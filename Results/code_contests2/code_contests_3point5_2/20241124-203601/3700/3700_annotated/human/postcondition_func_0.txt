The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b` which are integers. It calculates the sum of `a` and `b`, and if the sum is greater than or equal to a variable `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from the sum. The function then returns the final value of `c`. The function does not specify the value of `mod` or handle cases where `mod` is not defined, so potential edge cases include the need to define `mod` and consider scenarios where `mod` is not provided.
