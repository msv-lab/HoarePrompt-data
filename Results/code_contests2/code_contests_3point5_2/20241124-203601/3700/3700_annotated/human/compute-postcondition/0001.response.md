Example Answer:
The code calculates the sum of the integers obtained from the input. The previous values of the affected variables are H_i, N, and K. There are no changes to these variables directly. Therefore, the Output State is: H_i is an integer representing the health of the i-th monster, N is a positive integer representing the number of monsters, K is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of times Fennec can use Special Move, and the sum of the input integers is stored in variable s.
Output State: **H_i is an integer representing the health of the i-th monster, N is a positive integer representing the number of monsters, K is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of times Fennec can use Special Move, and the sum of the input integers is stored in variable s**
