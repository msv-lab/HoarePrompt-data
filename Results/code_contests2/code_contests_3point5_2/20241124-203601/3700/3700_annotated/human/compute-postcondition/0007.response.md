The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it implicitly accepts the parameters H_i, N, and K as described in the constraints. H_i is an integer representing the health of the i-th monster, N is a positive integer representing the number of monsters, and K is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of times Fennec can use Special Move. The function does not explicitly return any value in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to presumably perform some operations or calculations based on the health of monsters, the number of monsters, and the maximum number of times Fennec can use Special Move without explicitly returning a value.
