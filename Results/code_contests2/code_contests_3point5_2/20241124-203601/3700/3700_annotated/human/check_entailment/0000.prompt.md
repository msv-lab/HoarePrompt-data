You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Fennec is fighting with N monsters.

The health of the i-th monster is H_i.

Fennec can do the following two actions:

* Attack: Fennec chooses one monster. That monster's health will decrease by 1.
* Special Move: Fennec chooses one monster. That monster's health will become 0.



There is no way other than Attack and Special Move to decrease the monsters' health.

Fennec wins when all the monsters' healths become 0 or below.

Find the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq K \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq H_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
H_1 ... H_N


Output

Print the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, `c` are integers. The variable `c` is the result of the sum of `a` and `b`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is updated to `c - mod`. In all other cases where `c` is less than `mod`, no changes are made to `c`.
    return c
    #The program returns the value of 'c' after the specified conditions are applied

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    H, N = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    s = sum([int(x) for x in raw_input().split()])
    if (s >= H) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *H_i is an integer representing the health of the i-th monster, N is a positive integer representing the number of monsters, K is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of times Fennec can use Special Move, and the sum of the input integers is stored in variable s. If s is greater than or equal to H, the output will be 'Yes', and all variables remain unchanged. If the sum of the input integers is less than H, the output will be 'No'.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
