Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the given problem description. The program defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2`, but none of them actually calculate the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do an Attack before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times. Additionally, the `print` statement in `func_2` is checking if the sum of monster healths is greater than or equal to H, which is not related to the problem description at all.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not address the problem requirements.
