Correctness: **False**

The given program does not solve the problem described. The program defines two functions that are not related to the problem statement. It reads input in a way that is not specified in the problem description. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not perform the required actions to find the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack before winning, based on the monsters' health and the allowed number of Special Move. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and is incorrect.
