Postcondition: ***H and N are integers meeting the specified conditions. If the sum s of the input integers is greater than or equal to H, then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed. The program handles all cases where the sum s is either greater than or equal to H or less than H, providing a clear decision outcome in each scenario.***
