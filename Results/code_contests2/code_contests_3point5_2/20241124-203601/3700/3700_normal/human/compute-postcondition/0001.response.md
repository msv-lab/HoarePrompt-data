Example Answer:
The code calculates the sum of the integers obtained by splitting the input string. The input is taken from the standard input, so the values of H, N, and K are not affected. The sum of the integers is stored in the variable s. 
Output State: **H and N are integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5, and 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for all i; s is the sum of the integers obtained from the input**
