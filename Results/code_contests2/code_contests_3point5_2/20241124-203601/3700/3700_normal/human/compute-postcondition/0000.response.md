Example Answer:
H and N are assigned values based on the input split by space. The values of H and N are unknown at this point, so the output state is H and N are integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5, and 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for all i.
Output State: **H and N are integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5, and 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for all i**
