The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, calculates the sum of `a` and `b`, and if the sum is greater than or equal to `mod`, it updates the sum to be the remainder after subtracting `mod` from it. The function then returns this calculated value of `c`. The functionality does not cover cases where `mod` is not defined or where the parameters `a` and `b` are not non-negative integers.
