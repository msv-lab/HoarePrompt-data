Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The code simply prints '10' repeated `n // 2` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd. This approach does not take into account the visitors' preferences and the beauty of the segments. The output hints do not agree with the code as they do not mention the actual problem requirements of maximizing the sum of beauties of all segments. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
