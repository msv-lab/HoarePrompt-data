Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values from the user input after being split by space. The values of `n` and `m` are integers within the range 1 to 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3**
