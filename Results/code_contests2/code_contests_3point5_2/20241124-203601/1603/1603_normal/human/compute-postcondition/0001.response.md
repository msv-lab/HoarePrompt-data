Example Answer:
The code prints '10' repeated n//2 times, followed by '1' if n is odd. Since n and m are integers between 1 and 1000, the value of n//2 will be an integer. If n is odd, the string will end with a '1'. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3 and the output of the code is a string based on the conditions mentioned.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3 and the output of the code is a string based on the conditions mentioned**
