Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply prints "10" repeated n//2 times and adds a '1' if n is odd.

The program does not calculate the maximum sum of beauties of all segments as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide the correct output based on the given problem description.
