Example Answer: 
The code snippet prints a string that contains '10' repeated n//2 times, followed by '1' if n is odd. Given the initial state where n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3, the output state after running the code is unchanged as no variables are modified.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3**
