Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes input from the user and splits it into integers. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers, their values are correctly assigned. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers with values as provided by user input.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with values as provided by user input**
