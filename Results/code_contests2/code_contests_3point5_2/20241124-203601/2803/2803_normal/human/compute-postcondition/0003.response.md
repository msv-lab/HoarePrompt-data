Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input. It then calculates and prints the result based on a conditional expression. If `k - 1` evaluates to True, it calculates `2` raised to the power of the length of the binary representation of `n` minus `1`. Otherwise, it prints the value of `n`. The function does not have any explicit return value. **
