Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not align with the problem description for every potential case. The code calculates the xor-sum in a different way than what is described in the problem statement. The code uses a formula based on the length of the binary representation of `n` and `k`, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

For example, if we take the input (4, 3) where n = 4 and k = 3, the code will output 3 instead of the expected output of 7. This discrepancy shows that the code does not handle all cases correctly.

Therefore, the code is incorrect based on the discrepancy between the provided code and the problem description.
