The function `func` reads two integer values `n` and `k` from the user input. It then calculates `2` raised to the power of the length of the binary representation of `n`, subtracts `1` from the result if `k - 1` is true, and prints the result. However, the function does not handle any exceptions or errors that might occur during the user input or calculation process.
