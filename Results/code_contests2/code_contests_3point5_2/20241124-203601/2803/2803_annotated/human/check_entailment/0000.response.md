Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided program takes in two integers n and k, representing the number of candies and the maximum number of candies Grisha can take respectively. It then calculates and prints the largest possible xor-sum that Grisha can obtain.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the largest xor-sum that Grisha can obtain. It calculates the xor-sum by performing a bitwise XOR operation on the numbers 1 to n. The program handles the edge case where k is equal to 1 by returning n directly, as taking only one candy will result in the same xor-sum as the candy's tastiness.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
