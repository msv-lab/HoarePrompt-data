Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the largest possible xor-sum that Grisha can obtain based on the given input values of n and k. The logic used in the program is aligned with the problem description, where it calculates the xor-sum based on the binary representation of n and k. The program handles the case when k is 1 separately to return n as the xor-sum. The program covers all potential cases and produces the correct output.
