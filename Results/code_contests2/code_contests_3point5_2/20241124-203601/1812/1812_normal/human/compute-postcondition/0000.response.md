Example Answer: 
The lambda function `gets` is defined to accept an input from standard input and strip any leading or trailing whitespaces. The function uses `sys.stdin.readline` for input. The variables `n` and `s` are not directly affected by this code snippet, so the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a' to 'f')**
