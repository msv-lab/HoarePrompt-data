Example Answer:
M is assigned the value of N - 1 & 3. The value of N is extracted from the input string S, so the value of M depends on the value of N. The bitwise AND operation is performed with 3, so the possible values for M are 0, 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a' to 'f'); N is an integer value extracted from the input string S, C is the calculated value from the formula, and M is 0, 1, 2, or 3.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a' to 'f'); N is an integer value extracted from the input string S, C is the calculated value from the formula, and M is 0, 1, 2, or 3**
