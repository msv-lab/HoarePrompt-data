Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a' to 'f'); N is an integer value extracted from the input string S, C is the calculated value from the formula, and M is 0, 1, 2, or 3. If M is 1 or 2, then N is decremented by M, M is bitwise XORed with 3, and N is incremented by the new value of M. All variables maintain their respective types and relationships after the execution of the if statement.***
