Example Answer: 
The value of M is calculated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with 3. Since M can be either 1 or 2, after the operation, M will become 2 or 1 respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a' to 'f'); N is an integer value extracted from the input string S decreased by M, C is the calculated value from the formula, and M is either 2 or 1.
