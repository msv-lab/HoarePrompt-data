Example Answer:
The character at the last position of string S is converted to its ASCII value and then subtracted by the ASCII value of 'a'. This value is assigned to variable C. Since N is an integer extracted from the input string S, the output state is: n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a' to 'f'); N is an integer value extracted from the input string S, C is the calculated value from the formula.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a' to 'f'); N is an integer value extracted from the input string S, C is the calculated value from the formula.**
