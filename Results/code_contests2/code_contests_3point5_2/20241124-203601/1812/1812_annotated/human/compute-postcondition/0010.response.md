Output State: **Vasya's seat is a positive integer representing the row index. If M is equal to 1 or 2, then N is decremented by M, M is XORed with 3, and then N is incremented by the new value of M. In all other cases, there is no change to the values of N and M. The code prints the result of the expression ((N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C)).**
