Example Answer:
`N` is incremented by the value of `M`. The initial state is that Vasya's seat is a positive integer representing the row index XOR 3. After executing the code, the value of Vasya's seat remains unchanged, and `N` is increased by `M`.
Output State: **Vasya's seat is a positive integer representing the row index XOR 3, `N` is incremented by `M`**
