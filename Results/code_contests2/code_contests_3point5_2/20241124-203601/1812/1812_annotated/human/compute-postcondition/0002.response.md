Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the integer value obtained by removing the last character of the input string `S`. Since the input represents Vasya's seat in the format ns, where n is a positive integer, the value of `N` will be the row index. The seat character is not used in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: Vasya's seat is described as a positive integer representing the row index.
Output State: **Vasya's seat is described as a positive integer representing the row index**
