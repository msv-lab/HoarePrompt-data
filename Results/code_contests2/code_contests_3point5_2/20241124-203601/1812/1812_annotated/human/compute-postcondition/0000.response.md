Example Answer:
The lambda function `gets` is defined to read input from the standard input and strip any leading or trailing whitespaces. The function does not affect the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: Vasya's seat is described in the format ns, where n is a positive integer representing the index of the row (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in this row, which is one of the letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'.
