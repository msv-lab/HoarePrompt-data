The function `func` reads input to determine Vasya's seat based on given constraints. It calculates Vasya's seat index and character based on the input received. The output is the description of Vasya's seat in the format ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row index (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), and s is a character representing the seat in this row, which is one of the letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'. The function handles cases where M is equal to 1 or 2 by adjusting the values of N and M accordingly before calculating and printing Vasya's seat.
