Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in the correct solution of a sudoku puzzle and changes at most 9 elements to make it an anti-sudoku. It correctly identifies the elements to change and ensures that each row, column, and 3x3 block will have at least two equal elements after the changes. The logic of the program is sound and it follows the problem description accurately. Since the program meets all the requirements and there are no potential cases provided where it fails to produce the desired output, the correctness is deemed true.
