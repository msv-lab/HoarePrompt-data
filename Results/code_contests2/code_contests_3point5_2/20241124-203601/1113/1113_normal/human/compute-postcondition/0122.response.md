Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with `i`, where `i` is the first element in `row`. The value of `i` has a specific behavior based on the input, and `row` is assigned the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i`, the first element in `row`, determines the behavior, `row` is assigned the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces, `row` contains more elements, `nRow` is concatenated with `i`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i`, the first element in `row`, determines the behavior, `row` is assigned the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces, `row` contains more elements, `nRow` is concatenated with `i`**
