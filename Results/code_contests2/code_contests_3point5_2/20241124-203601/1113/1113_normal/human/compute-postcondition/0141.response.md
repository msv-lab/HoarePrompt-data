Example Answer: 
`nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`, so the resulting string in `nRow` will have `i` added at the end. The values of `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the first character in `row`, `nRow` is the string with '9' replaced by '1' based on the value of `i`, `row` has at least 1 character, `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespaces, and `i` is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the first character in `row`, `nRow` is the string with '9' replaced by '1' based on the value of `i`, `row` has at least 1 character, `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespaces, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
