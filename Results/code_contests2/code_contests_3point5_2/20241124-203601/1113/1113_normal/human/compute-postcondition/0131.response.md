According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the last element in `row`, `nRow` is the string with '9' replaced by '1' based on the values of `i`, `row` is the input string without leading or trailing whitespaces. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `nRow` should be updated to reflect the replacement of '9' with '1' based on the new value of `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is the string with '9' replaced by '1' based on the new value of `i`, `row` is the input string without leading or trailing whitespaces**
