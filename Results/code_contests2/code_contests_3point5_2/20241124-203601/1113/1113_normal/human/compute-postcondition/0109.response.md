Output State: 
- `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1'. 
- `i` is the next element in `row`. 
- `nRow` is updated based on the new `i`. 
- If `i` is '9', the value of `nRow` is appended by '1'. 
- Otherwise, the value of `nRow` is appended by the original value of `i`.
- If `row` is an empty string or does not contain any '9' characters, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain unchanged.
