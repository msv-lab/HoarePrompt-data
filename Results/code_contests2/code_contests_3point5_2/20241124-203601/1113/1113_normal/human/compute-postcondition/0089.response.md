Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', `i` is appended to `nRow`. `row` still has more elements. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains the same, `nRow` is still an empty string, `i` is still 0, and `row` is still an empty string.**
