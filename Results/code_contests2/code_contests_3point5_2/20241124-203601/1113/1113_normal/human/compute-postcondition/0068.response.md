According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9. This means the loop will not execute again. Since the loop will not execute, no states need to be adjusted for the next iteration.
State: **`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row` based on the condition, `i` is 9, `nRow` is an empty string `''`**
