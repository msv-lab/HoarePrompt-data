Postcondition: ***`sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow` are assigned as described. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` has '1' appended to it. If `i` is not equal to '9', then the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`. In both cases, `nRow` contains the concatenated values based on the condition of `i`.***
