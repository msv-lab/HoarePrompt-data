According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If there are more elements in the `row` list, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` is 0, `nRow` is the first character in `row`, and `row` is not empty. If the value of `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to include '1' at the end. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to include the value of `i` at the end.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` should be updated to the next element in `row`.
- If the next element in `row` is '9', `nRow` should be updated to include '1' at the end. Otherwise, `nRow` should be updated to include the next element in `row` at the end.

State: **`res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` still has more elements**
