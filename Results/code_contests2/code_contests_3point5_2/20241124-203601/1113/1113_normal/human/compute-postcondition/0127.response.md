Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1'. The behavior is determined by the first element `i` in `row`. `row` is assigned the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated by adding '1' to the end. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is updated by adding `i`. The variable `nRow` will contain the final updated string based on the conditions described above.***
