Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. The previous values of `nRow` and `i` are not provided, so the output state is: `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` points to the next character in `row`, `nRow` is the string with '9' replaced by '1' based on the value of the second character in `row` and '1' appended if the second character is '9', `row` has at least 3 characters, `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespaces.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` points to the next character in `row`, `nRow` is the string with '9' replaced by '1' based on the value of the second character in `row` and '1' appended if the second character is '9', `row` has at least 3 characters, `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespaces.**
