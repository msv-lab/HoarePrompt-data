Example Answer: 
The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so after execution, `nRow` will have the updated value with '1' concatenated. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1'.
Output State: **`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1'**
