Output State: **`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row` based on the condition, `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated by appending '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`. If `row` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains unchanged, `i` is 9, and `nRow` is an empty string `''`.**
