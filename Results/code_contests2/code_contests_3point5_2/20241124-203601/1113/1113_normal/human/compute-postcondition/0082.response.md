Example Answer: 
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `res`, `i`, and `nRow`, so the output state is: `res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` still has more elements.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` still has more elements**
