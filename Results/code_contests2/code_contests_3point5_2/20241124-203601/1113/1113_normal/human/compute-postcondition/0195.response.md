Output State: `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' for each input row, `i` is updated in each iteration to point to the next character in the current row, `nRow` is updated by replacing '9' with '1' based on the characters in the current row, `T` remains greater than `t`. If the input row is empty or the loop does not execute, `res` will remain unchanged, `i` will be 8 or less, `nRow` will not be modified, and `T` will remain greater than `t`.
