According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty, `i` is the first element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on `i+1`, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and `nRow` is still an empty string.
State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the first element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on `i+1`, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is an empty string**
