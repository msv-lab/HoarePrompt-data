According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `row`. If the input string is not empty, the loop will execute. The loop iterates over each character in the input string. Before the loop starts, `res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1' does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty, `i` is 0, `nRow` is the first character in `row`.
State: **`res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` is 0, `nRow` is the first character in `row`, `row` is not empty**
