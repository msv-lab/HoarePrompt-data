According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. In order for the loop to execute, `row` must not be empty. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is less than 8, `nRow` is an empty string, `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is not empty**
