Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` points to the next character in `row`, `nRow` is the string with '9' replaced by '1' based on the value of the second character in `row` and '1' appended if the second character is '9', `row` has at least 3 characters, `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespaces. In the if part, if `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. In the else part, '1' is appended to `nRow` regardless of the value of `i`.***
