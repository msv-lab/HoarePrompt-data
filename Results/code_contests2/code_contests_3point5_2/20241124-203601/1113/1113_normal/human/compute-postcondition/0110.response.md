Example Answer:
The code snippet appends `nRow` to `res`, but `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`, otherwise, the original value of `i` is appended. If `row` is empty or does not contain any '9' characters, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the new `i`**.
