According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `row` list. If there is still an element left in the list, the loop will execute one more time. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the new `i`. If `i` is '9', the value of `nRow` is appended by '1'. Otherwise, the value of `nRow` is appended by the original value of `i`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the new `i`.**
