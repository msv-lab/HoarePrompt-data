Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding `i` to its current value. The value of `i` is determined based on the behavior of the first element in `row`. The `row` string is processed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces, and then the first element is checked to determine the value of `i`. After adding `i` to `nRow`, the output state is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is determined based on the behavior of the first element in `row`, `row` is assigned the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is updated by adding `i`**
