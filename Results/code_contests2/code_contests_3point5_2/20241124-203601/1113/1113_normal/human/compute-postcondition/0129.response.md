Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1'. The loop processes each element in `row` one by one. If the current element `i` is '9', it is replaced with '1' in `nRow`. Otherwise, `i` is appended to `nRow`. The loop continues until all elements in `row` have been processed. After the loop, `res` will have the final modified rows, `i` will be the last element in `row`, `nRow` will be the string with '9' replaced by '1' based on the values of `i`, `row` will be the input string without leading or trailing whitespaces. If `row` is empty, the loop won't execute and `res` will remain the same as the initial state, `i` will be undefined, `nRow` will be an empty string, and `row` will be an empty string.**
