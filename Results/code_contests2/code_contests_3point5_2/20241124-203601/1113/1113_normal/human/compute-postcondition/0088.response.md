According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `row` list. If there are more elements in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', `i` is appended to `nRow'. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in the `row` list:
1. If the next element is '9', '1' should be appended to `nRow`.
2. If the next element is not '9', the next element should be appended to `nRow`.
3. `i` should be updated to the next element in the `row` list.

State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`. If the next element is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. If the next element is not '9', the next element is appended to `nRow`.**
