Postcondition: ***`sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row` remain unchanged. `nRow` is modified based on the conditions met in the if-else block to ensure the loop executes one more time. If `i` is equal to '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`.***
