Example Answer:
The variable `res` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`sys.stdout` is assigned `io.BytesIO()`, `input` is assigned `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list**
