Postcondition: ***`sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow` are assigned as described. If the last value of `i` was '9', then `nRow` has '1' appended to it. If the last value of `i` was not '9', then the last value of `i` is appended to `nRow`. After the if-else block executes, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, ensuring that it follows the specified conditions. All variables maintain their initial assignments and relationships based on the conditions met in the if and else parts of the program fragment.***
