Output State: 
After the loop executes, `res` will contain the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' for each input row. `i` will be updated in each iteration to point to the next character in the current row. `nRow` will be updated by replacing '9' with '1' based on the characters in the current row. If the input row is empty or the loop does not execute, `res` will remain unchanged, `i` will be 8 or less, `nRow` will not be modified, and `T` will remain greater than `t`.
