According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` will contain the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` will be the next element in `row` for each iteration, `nRow` will be updated by replacing '9' with '1' in the current `row`. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `row` should not be empty. `res` will contain the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` will be the next element in `row` for the next iteration, `nRow` will be updated by replacing '9' with '1' in the current `row`.

State: **`res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated with '9' replaced by '1'**
