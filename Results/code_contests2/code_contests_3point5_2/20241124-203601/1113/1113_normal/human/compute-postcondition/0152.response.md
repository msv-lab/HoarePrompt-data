Output State: 
- If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains unchanged, `i` is 9, `nRow` is an empty string, `T` is greater than `t`.
- If `row` contains at least one character, the loop iterates through each character in `row`. For each character:
  - If the character is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`.
  - If the character is not '9', the character itself is appended to `nRow`.
- After the loop executes, `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` points to the next character in `row`, `nRow` is the string with '9' replaced by '1' based on the value of the characters in `row`, `T` is greater than `t`. 

**Output State: `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` points to the next character in `row`, `nRow` is the string with '9' replaced by '1' based on the value of the characters in `row`, `T` is greater than `t`.**
