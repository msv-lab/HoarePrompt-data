According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', `i` is appended to `nRow`. Since `i` is the next element in `row` and `row` still has more elements, the loop can execute one more time. 
So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `i` is less than 9**
