Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its current value. Since the initial state is not given, the output state is `res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1'.
Output State: **`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1'**
