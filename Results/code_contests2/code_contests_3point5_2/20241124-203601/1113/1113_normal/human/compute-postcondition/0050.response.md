Example Answer: 
`nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`, and `res` list contains the concatenated values of `row` based on the condition. The value of `i` is 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` list contains the concatenated values of `row` based on the condition, `i` is 9, `nRow` is an empty string `''`.
Output State: **`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row` based on the condition, `i` is 9, `nRow` is an empty string `''`**
