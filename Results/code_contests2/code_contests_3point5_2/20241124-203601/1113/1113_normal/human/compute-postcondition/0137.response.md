According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`, as it is being iterated over. If `row` has at least 1 character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state `row` is assigned the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespaces does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` has at least 1 character and `i` is the first character in `row`.
State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the first character in `row`, `nRow` is the string with '9' replaced by '1' based on the value of `i`, `row` has at least 1 character, `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespaces**
