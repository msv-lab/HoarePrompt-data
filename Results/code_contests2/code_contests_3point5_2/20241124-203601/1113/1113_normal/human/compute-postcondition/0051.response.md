According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` list. If `row` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the start, `nRow` is an empty string `''` and `i` is 9, which are not directly related to the loop execution. Hence, for the loop to execute, `row` must have at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element in the `row` list.
State: **`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row` based on the condition, `i` is the first element in `row`, `nRow` is an empty string `''`**
