Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the first character in `row`, `nRow` is the string with '9' replaced by '1' based on the value of `i`, `row` has at least 1 character, `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespaces. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` remains unchanged.***
