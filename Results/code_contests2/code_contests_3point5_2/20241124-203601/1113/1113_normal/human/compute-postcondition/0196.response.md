According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `t` and `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T` remains greater than `t`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be updated to the next value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' for each input row, `i` is updated to point to the next character in the current row, `nRow` is updated by replacing '9' with '1' based on the characters in the current row, `T` remains greater than the new `t` value**
