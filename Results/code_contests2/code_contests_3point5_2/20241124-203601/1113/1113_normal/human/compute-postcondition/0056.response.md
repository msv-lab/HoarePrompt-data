Postcondition: ***`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row` based on the condition. If the first element in `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i`, where `i` is the first element in `row` and `i` is not equal to '9'. The postcondition covers all possible cases of the if-else block, ensuring that `res`, `i`, and `nRow` are updated correctly based on the conditions specified.***
