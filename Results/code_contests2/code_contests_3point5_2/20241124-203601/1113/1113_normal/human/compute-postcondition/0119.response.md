Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1'. `i`, the first element in `row`, determines the behavior: if `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '1' and `nRow` is based on `i+1`. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` remains empty and is concatenated with the value of `i`. `row` is assigned the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces. The postcondition covers all edge cases, ensuring that the program functions correctly.***
