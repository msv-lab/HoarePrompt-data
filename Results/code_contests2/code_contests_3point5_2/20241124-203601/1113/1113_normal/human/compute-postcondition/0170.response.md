Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is less than 8, `nRow` contains the concatenated value of the current `i` with an additional '1' if `i` is '9', and solely the current `i` if `i` is not '9', `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is not empty, and the loop has more elements in `row`. Additionally, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated by appending '1', otherwise, `nRow` remains the same.***
