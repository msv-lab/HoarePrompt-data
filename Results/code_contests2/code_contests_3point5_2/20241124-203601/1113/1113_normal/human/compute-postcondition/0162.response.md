Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is less than 8, `nRow` is either '1' if `i` was '9' or contains the concatenated value of `i` if `i` was not '9', `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is not empty. In the if part, when `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. In the else part, when `i` is not '9', `i` is appended to `nRow`. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if-else block.***
