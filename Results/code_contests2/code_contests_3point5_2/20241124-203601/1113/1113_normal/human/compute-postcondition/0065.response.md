According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `row`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' if `i` is '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the next element in `row`, and `nRow` should be updated accordingly based on the next element in `row`.
State: **`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`**
