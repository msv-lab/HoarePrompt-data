According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `row` list. If there are more elements left in the list, the loop will execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, and the conditions for updating `nRow` are based on the first element in `row`. If the first element is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1', otherwise, it is updated by concatenating the first element of `row` that is not equal to '9'.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the `row` list should have more elements left, and the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block**
