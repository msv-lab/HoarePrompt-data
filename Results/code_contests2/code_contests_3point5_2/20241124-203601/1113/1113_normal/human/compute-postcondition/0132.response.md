Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the last element in `row`, `nRow` is the string with '9' replaced by '1' based on the values of `i`, `row` is the input string without leading or trailing whitespaces. If the input is empty, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains the same, `nRow` is still an empty string, `i` is still 0, and `row` is still an empty string.**
