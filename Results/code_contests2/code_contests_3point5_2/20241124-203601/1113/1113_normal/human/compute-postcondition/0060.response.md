Postcondition: ***`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated after the if-else block execution. If `i` equals '9', then '1' is concatenated to `nRow`. Otherwise, the value of `i` is concatenated to `nRow`. The postcondition accounts for all possible scenarios where `i` can be '9' or any other value, ensuring that `nRow` is correctly updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block.***
