According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times in total. At the end of the previous iteration, the `res` list contains the concatenated values of `row` based on the condition. All other variables maintain their initial assignments. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row` based on the condition, `i` is 9**
