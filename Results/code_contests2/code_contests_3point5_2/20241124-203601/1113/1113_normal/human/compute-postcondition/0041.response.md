According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values in the `row` variable. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

If the last value of `i` was '9':
- `nRow` should have '1' appended to it.

If the last value of `i` was not '9':
- The last value of `i` should be appended to `nRow`.

After the if-else block executes:
- `nRow` should be updated based on the value of `i` to ensure it follows the specified conditions.

All other variables maintain their initial assignments and relationships based on the conditions met in the if and else parts of the program fragment.

State: **`sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow` are adjusted accordingly based on the conditions met in the if-else block to ensure the loop executes one more time.**
