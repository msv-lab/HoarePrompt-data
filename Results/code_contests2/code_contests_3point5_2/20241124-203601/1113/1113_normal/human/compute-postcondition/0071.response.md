According to the code, the loop can execute for i ranging from 0 to 8. Before the loop starts, `res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1' does not ensure the loop will execute. The loop will execute as long as i ranges from 0 to 8. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `i` should be set to 0, and `nRow` should be updated with '9' replaced by '1'.
State: **`res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` is 0, `nRow` is updated with '9' replaced by '1'**
