Example Answer: 
The `res` list appends the value of `nRow`. The value of `nRow` is determined by concatenating values from `row` based on the given conditions. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains empty as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` list contains the concatenated values of `row` based on the condition; all other variables maintain their initial assignments.
Output State: **`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row` based on the condition; all other variables maintain their initial assignments**
