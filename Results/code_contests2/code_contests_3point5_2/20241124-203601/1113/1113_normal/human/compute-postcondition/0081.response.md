Example Answer: 
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its current value. The previous value of `nRow` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', so the updated `nRow` will have the modified rows with an additional '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` still has more elements.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` still has more elements**
