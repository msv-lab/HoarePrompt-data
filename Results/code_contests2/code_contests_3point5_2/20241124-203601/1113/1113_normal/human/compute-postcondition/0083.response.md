Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` still has more elements. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` has '1' appended to it. Otherwise, `nRow` has `i` appended to it. The modified `res`, `i`, `nRow`, and `row` variables are in accordance with the initial state described in the precondition, ensuring the continuation of the loop with the next element in `row`.***
