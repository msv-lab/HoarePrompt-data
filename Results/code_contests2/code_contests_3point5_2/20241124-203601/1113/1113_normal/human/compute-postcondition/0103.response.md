Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1'. `i` is the next element in `row`. `nRow` is updated based on the next element after the current `i`. `i` is less than 9. `row` is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if else block.***
