According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 8, `nRow` contains the concatenated value of the current `i` with an additional '1' if `i` is '9' or solely the current `i` if `i` is not '9'. `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is not empty, and `nRow` has been appended to `res`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `nRow` needs to be updated accordingly. Since `i` is less than 8 at the end of the last iteration, `nRow` should contain the concatenated value of the next `i` with an additional '1' if the next `i` is '9' or solely the next `i` if the next `i` is not '9'.

State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' and adding '1' if needed, `i` is less than 9, `nRow` contains the concatenated value of the next `i` with an additional '1' if the next `i` is '9' or solely the next `i` if the next `i` is not '9', `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is not empty, and the next `nRow` has been appended to `res`.**
