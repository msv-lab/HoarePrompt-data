Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`. The previous states of the variables are as follows: `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the new `i`, and all other states remain the same. After executing the code, the new value of `nRow` is the sum of the previous value of `nRow` and the current value of `i`. 
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the new `i` + i.**
