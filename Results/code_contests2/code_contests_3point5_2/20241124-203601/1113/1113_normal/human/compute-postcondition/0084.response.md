According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `row` list and the values of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, and `row` still has more elements. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` has '1' appended to it. Otherwise, `nRow` has `i` appended to it.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- If the next element in `row` is '9', `i` needs to be '1'.
- If the next element in `row` is not '9', `i` needs to be that next element.
- `nRow` needs to be updated based on the next element in `row`.
- Ensure that `row` still has more elements to continue the loop.

State: **`res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` still has more elements**
