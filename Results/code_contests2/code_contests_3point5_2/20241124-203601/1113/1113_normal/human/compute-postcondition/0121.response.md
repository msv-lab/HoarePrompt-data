Example Answer:
`nRow` has '9' replaced with '1' and then '1' is added at the end. The previous values of the variables are not directly affecting this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i`, the first element in `row`, determines the behavior, `row` is assigned the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces, `row` contains more elements, `nRow` has '1' added at the end.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i`, the first element in `row`, determines the behavior, `row` is assigned the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces, `row` contains more elements, `nRow` has '1' added at the end**
