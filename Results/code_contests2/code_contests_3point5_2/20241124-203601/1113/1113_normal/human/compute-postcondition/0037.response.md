According to the code, the loop can execute based on the values in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow` are assigned as described. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` has '1' appended to it. If `i` is not equal to '9', then the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`. In both cases, `nRow` contains the concatenated values based on the condition of `i`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the last value of `i` was '9', then '1' needs to be appended to `nRow`.
- If the last value of `i` was not '9', then the last value of `i` needs to be appended to `nRow`.

State: **`sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow` are assigned as described. If the last value of `i` was '9', then `nRow` has '1' appended to it. If the last value of `i` was not '9', then the last value of `i` is appended to `nRow`.**
