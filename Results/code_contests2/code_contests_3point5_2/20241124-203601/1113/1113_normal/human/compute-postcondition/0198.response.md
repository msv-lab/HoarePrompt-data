Example Answer:
The code snippet writes the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' for each input row. The loop iterates over the rows, updating `res` with the modified rows. Variable `i` is updated in each iteration to point to the next character in the current row. Variable `nRow` is updated by replacing '9' with '1' based on the characters in the current row. If the input row is empty or the loop does not execute, `res` remains unchanged. `i` will be 8 or less, `nRow` will not be modified, and `T` will remain greater than `t`.
Output State: **The modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' are written. `i` points to the next character in the current row. `nRow` is updated with '9' replaced by '1' based on the characters in the row. If the input row is empty, `res` remains unchanged. `i` is 8 or less, `nRow` is not modified, and `T` is greater than `t`.**
