According to the code, the loop will always execute since the range is given as 9 which means there are 9 iterations. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is 9, `nRow` is the string with '9' replaced by '1' based on the value of `i`, `row` is the input string without leading or trailing whitespaces, `T` is greater than `t`**
