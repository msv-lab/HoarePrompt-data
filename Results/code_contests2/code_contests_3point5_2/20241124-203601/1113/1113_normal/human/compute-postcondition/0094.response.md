According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `row` variable. Before the loop starts, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and since `i` is the next element in `row`, `i` is less than 9, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `nRow` is an empty string. To ensure the loop can execute, the `i` value should be the first element in `row`.
State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the first element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `i` is less than 9, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is an empty string**
