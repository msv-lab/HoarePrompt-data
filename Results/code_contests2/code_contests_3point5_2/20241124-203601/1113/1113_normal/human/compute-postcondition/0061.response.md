According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements remaining in the `row` list. At the end of the last iteration, `res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated after the if-else block execution based on the value of `i`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in the `row` list, which is represented by `i`. If `i` equals '9', then '1' is concatenated to `nRow`. Otherwise, the value of `i` is concatenated to `nRow`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `nRow` should be updated based on the next element in `row`. If the next element `i` is '9', then '1' should be concatenated to `nRow`. Otherwise, the value of `i` should be concatenated to `nRow`.
State: **`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row**.
