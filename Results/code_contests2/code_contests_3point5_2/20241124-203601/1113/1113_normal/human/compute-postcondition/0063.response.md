Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`. The values of `res` and `row` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `nRow`. Therefore, the output state is: `res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row.
Output State: **`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row**
