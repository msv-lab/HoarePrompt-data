Postcondition: ***`sys.stdout` is assigned `io.BytesIO()`, `input` is assigned `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is in the range of 0 to 8, `row` is assigned the stripped input value with at least one character. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is updated to have an additional '1' character at the end. Otherwise, `nRow` remains unchanged. The program state after the execution of the if else block covers all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
