Output State: **After the loop executes, `nRow` will contain the concatenation of values from `row` based on the condition where if `i` is '9', '1' is appended, otherwise `i` is appended. All other variables maintain their initial assignments. If `row` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string as well.**
