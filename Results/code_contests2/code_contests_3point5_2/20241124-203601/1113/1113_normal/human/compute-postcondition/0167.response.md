According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more elements in the `row` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is less than 8, `nRow` is either '1' if `i` was '9' or contains the concatenated value of `i` if `i` was not '9', `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is not empty, and the loop has more elements in `row`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the last `i` value was '9', then '1' was appended to `nRow`, so in the next iteration, `nRow` should contain the concatenated value of the current `i`.
- If the last `i` value was not '9', then the current value of `i` should be concatenated with the current `nRow`.
- The loop should continue as long as there are more elements in `row` to iterate over.

State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is less than 8, `nRow` contains the concatenated value of the current `i`, `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is not empty, and the loop has more elements in `row`.**
