Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is less than 8, `nRow` contains the concatenated value of the current `i` with an additional '1' if `i` is '9', and solely the current `i` if `i` is not '9', `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is not empty. The loop will execute at least once if `row` is not empty. If `row` is empty, the loop will not execute and `nRow` will remain an empty string.**
