According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is in the range of 0 to 8. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 9.
State: **`sys.stdout` is assigned `io.BytesIO()`, `input` is assigned `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 9, `row` is assigned the stripped input value with at least one character**
