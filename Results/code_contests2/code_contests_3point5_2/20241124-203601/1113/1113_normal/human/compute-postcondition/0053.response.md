Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is concatenated with '1', so after execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` list contains the concatenated values of `row` where the first element in `row` is '9', `i` is the first element in `row`, `nRow` is '1'.
Output State: **`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row` where the first element in `row` is '9', `i` is the first element in `row`, `nRow` is '1'**
