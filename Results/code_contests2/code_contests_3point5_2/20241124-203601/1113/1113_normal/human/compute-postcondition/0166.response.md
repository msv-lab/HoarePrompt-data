Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is less than 8, `nRow` is either '1' if `i` was '9' or contains the concatenated value of `i` if `i` was not '9', `T` is greater than `t`, `row` is not empty, the loop has more elements in `row`, and the next value to be appended to `nRow` is determined based on the value of `i` used in the previous iteration. If `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the current value of `i` is concatenated with `nRow`***
