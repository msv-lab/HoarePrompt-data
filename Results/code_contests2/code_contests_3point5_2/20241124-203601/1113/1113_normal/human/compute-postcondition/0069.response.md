Output State: **After the loop executes, `res` will contain the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` will be the next element in `row` for each iteration, `nRow` will be updated by replacing '9' with '1' in the current `row`. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains unchanged.**
