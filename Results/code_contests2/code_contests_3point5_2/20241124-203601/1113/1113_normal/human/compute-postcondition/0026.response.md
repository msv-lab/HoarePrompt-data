Output State: **`sys.stdout` is assigned `io.BytesIO()`, `input` is assigned `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is in the range of 0 to 8, `row` is assigned the stripped input value with at least one character. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is updated to contain '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated to contain the concatenated values of `i`. The loop essentially replaces all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1' in `nRow` and keeps the rest of the characters unchanged.**
