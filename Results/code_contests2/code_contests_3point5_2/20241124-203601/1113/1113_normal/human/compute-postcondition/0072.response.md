Example Answer:
The input is taken as a string and stored in the variable `row`. The value of `row` is not provided, so the output state is: `res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` is 0, `nRow` is updated with '9' replaced by '1', `row` contains the input string.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows based on replacing '9' with '1', `i` is 0, `nRow` is updated with '9' replaced by '1', `row` contains the input string**
