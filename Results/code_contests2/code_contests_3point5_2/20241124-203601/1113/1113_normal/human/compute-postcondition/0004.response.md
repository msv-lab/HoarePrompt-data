Example Answer:
maxint is assigned the value of positive infinity using the float function with 'inf' as input. The output state is sys.stdout is assigned io.BytesIO(), input is assigned io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline, write is assigned sys.stdout.write, and maxint is positive infinity.
Output State: **sys.stdout is assigned io.BytesIO(), input is assigned io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline, write is assigned sys.stdout.write, maxint is positive infinity**
