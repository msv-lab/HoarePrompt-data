Example Answer:
The input is stripped and stored in the variable `row`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' and adding '1' if needed, `i` is less than 9, `nRow` contains the concatenated value of the next `i` with an additional '1' if the next `i` is '9' or solely the next `i` if the next `i` is not '9', `T` is greater than `t`, `row` contains the stripped input, and the next `nRow` has been appended to `res`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' and adding '1' if needed, `i` is less than 9, `nRow` contains the concatenated value of the next `i` with an additional '1' if the next `i` is '9' or solely the next `i` if the next `i` is not '9', `T` is greater than `t`, `row` contains the stripped input, and the next `nRow` has been appended to `res`**
