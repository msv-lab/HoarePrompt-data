According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range specified in the loop. If `i` is less than the upper bound of the range, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the new `i`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to its next value, which means incrementing it by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the new `i+1`**
