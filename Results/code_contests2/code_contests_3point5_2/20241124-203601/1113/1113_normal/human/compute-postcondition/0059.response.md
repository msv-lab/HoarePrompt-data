Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`. The previous values of `nRow` and `i` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block.
Output State: **`res` list contains the concatenated values of `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block**
