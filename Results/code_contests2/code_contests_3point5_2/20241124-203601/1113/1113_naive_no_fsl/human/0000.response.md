Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to change at most 9 elements of the sudoku solution to make it an anti-sudoku. The program simply replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row of the sudoku solution, which does not guarantee that the resulting grid will be an anti-sudoku. 

The program lacks the necessary logic to ensure that each row, column, and 3x3 block will have at least two equal elements after changing at most 9 elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
