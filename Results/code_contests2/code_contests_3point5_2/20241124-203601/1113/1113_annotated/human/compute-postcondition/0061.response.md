According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the elements in the `row` and the value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row` and the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row` with '1' appended. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row` with the addition of `i` to `nRow`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Check the last value of `i` and modify it accordingly for the next iteration based on the conditions specified in the code.
2. Adjust `nRow` based on the modifications made to `i` in the previous step.

State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row` and the adjusted value of `i` for the next iteration.**
