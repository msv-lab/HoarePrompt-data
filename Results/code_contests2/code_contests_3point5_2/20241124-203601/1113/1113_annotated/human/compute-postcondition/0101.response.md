Example Answer: 
If the next element `i` in the `row` list is '9', then '1' will be appended to the `nRow` list. If the next element `i` is not '9', then the next `i` will be appended to the `nRow` list. Therefore, the output state is: Updated `res` list with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable. Next `i` is the next element in `row` list, `row` is not empty. 
Output State: **Updated `res` list with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable. Next `i` is the next element in `row` list, `row` is not empty.**
