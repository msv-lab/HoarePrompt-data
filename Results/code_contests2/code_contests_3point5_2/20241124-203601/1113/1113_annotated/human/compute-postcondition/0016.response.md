Postcondition: ***`sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow` are defined as specified. If `i` is '9', `nRow` has '1' appended to it. Otherwise, `nRow` retains the value of `i`. No matter the value of `i`, `nRow` is updated accordingly, ensuring that the program variables maintain their initial definitions and relationships.***
