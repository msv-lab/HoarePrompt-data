Example Answer: 
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so the new value of `nRow` depends on the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains the value of the next element in `row` plus `i`.
Output State: **`nRow` contains the value of the next element in `row` plus `i`**
