Output State: **If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, for each character `i` in `row`, if `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, `i` is appended to `nRow`. After the loop executes, `sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row` maintain their initial values. If the loop executes, `nRow` will contain the modified string based on the conditions mentioned.**
