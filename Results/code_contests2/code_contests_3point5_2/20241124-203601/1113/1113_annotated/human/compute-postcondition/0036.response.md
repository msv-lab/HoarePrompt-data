Postcondition: ***`row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty. If the first character `i` in `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` retains the value of the first character in `row`. The relationship between `row`, `nRow`, and `i` is maintained after the execution of the if else block, covering all possible scenarios.***
