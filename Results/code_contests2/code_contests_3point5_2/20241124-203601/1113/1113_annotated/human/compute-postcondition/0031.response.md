According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `nRow` being an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty and `i` is the first character in the `row`.
State: **`row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is the first character in `row`**
