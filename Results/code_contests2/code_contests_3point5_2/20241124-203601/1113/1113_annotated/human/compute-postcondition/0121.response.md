Output State: **`res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` retains the value of the first element in `row`. `row` contains at least 1 element, and `i` is the second element in `row`. If the second element in `row` is '9', the '9' is replaced by '1' in `nRow`. If the second element in `row` is not '9', `nRow` remains unchanged. `nRow` is appended with '1'.**
