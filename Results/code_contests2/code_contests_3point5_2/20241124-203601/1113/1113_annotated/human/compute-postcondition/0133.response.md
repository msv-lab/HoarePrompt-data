According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is the same. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **If `row` is not empty, `res` list will be updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable. If `row` is empty, `res` remains unchanged.**
