According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a string. If `i` is '9', `nRow` contains '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the value of `i'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `nRow` should contain the value of the next element in `row`.
State: **`nRow` should contain the value of the next element in `row`**
