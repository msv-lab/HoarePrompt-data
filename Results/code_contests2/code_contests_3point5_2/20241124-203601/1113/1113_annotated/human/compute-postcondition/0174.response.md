According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of `i`, which is from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a string that contains the value of each element in `row`. If `i` is '9', '1' is added to `nRow`. Otherwise, the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute and `nRow` remains an empty string. `res` contains the updated `nRow` after the operation.

Since the loop starts from 0 and goes up to 8, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` has to be less than 8. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` is 8. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 9. 

State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the value of each element in `row`, `i` is 9, `res` contains the updated `nRow` after the operation**
