According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are elements left in the `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are all '9', `row` is '11', `nRow` is '1011' if `i` is '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` is '1091' if `i` is not '9'. 

In the case where `i` is '9', nRow has '1' appended to its original value. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the nRow value must be updated to have '11' appended to its current value. 

State: **`sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are all '9', `row` is '11', `nRow` is '10111' if `i` is '9'.**

In the else case, nRow has the value of `i` appended to its original value. So, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the nRow value must be updated to have the current value of `i` appended to it.

State: **`sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are all '9', `row` is '11', `nRow` is '1092' if `i` is not '9'.**
