According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `row`. If there are more elements left in the `row`, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` contains the value of the next element in `row` appended with '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise, `nRow` contains the value of the next element in `row` plus `i`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the next element in `row` is '9' and `i` is '9', then `nRow` should contain the next element in `row` appended with '1'.
- If the next element in `row` is not '9', then `nRow` should contain the next element in `row` plus `i`.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`nRow` contains the value of the next element in `row` appended with '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise, `nRow` contains the value of the next element in `row` plus `i`.**
