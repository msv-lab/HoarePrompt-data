Postcondition: ***`res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable. If the next element `i` in `row` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. If the next element `i` in `row` is not '9', then `i` is appended to `nRow`. The variables `res`, `nRow`, `i`, and `row` maintain their initial relationships and values as described in the precondition. All possible cases including the boundary values of '9' are handled in the program logic.***
