Example Answer:
If the first character in `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` retains the value of the first character in `row` and 'i' is added to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, and `nRow` is updated accordingly based on the conditions mentioned.
