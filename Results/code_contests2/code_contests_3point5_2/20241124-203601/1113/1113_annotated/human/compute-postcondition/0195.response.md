Output State: **If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute 9 times. Each time, the characters in `row` will be checked, and if '9' is found, it will be replaced with '1' in `nRow`. The modified `nRow` will be appended to the `res` list. If `row` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain unchanged.**
