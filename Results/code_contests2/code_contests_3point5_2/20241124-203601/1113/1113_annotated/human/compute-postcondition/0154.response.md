According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute for values of `i` from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, no specific information is provided about the states. Since the loop will execute for one more iteration, the states need to be adjusted accordingly. Therefore, for the next iteration to occur, the state needs to be:
State: **If `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` contains the modified string with '9's replaced by '1's, and it is appended to the list `res`. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains empty**
