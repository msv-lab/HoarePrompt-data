According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `row`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` list is updated with `nRow`, `nRow` is updated after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable, `i` is the second element in `row`, and `nRow` is appended with '1'. If the second element in `row` is '9', it is replaced by '1' in `nRow`. If the second element in `row` is not '9', `nRow` remains unchanged. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If the second element in `row` is '9', it needs to be replaced by '1' in `nRow`.
2. `nRow` should retain the updated value.
3. `nRow` needs to be appended with '1' to signify the completion of the current iteration.
4. The loop should be able to continue, so there should be more elements in `row`.

State: **`res` list is updated with `nRow`, `nRow` is updated with any '9' replaced by '1' if applicable, `i` is the second element in `row`, `nRow` is appended with '1', and `row` contains more elements than the current iteration.**
