According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least 2 characters, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a string with at least 1 character. If the first character `i` in `row` is '9', `nRow` is updated to have '1' appended. Otherwise, `nRow` retains the first character of `row` appended. In all cases, `i` remains the first character of `row`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least 2 characters.
State: **`row` is a string with at least 2 characters**
