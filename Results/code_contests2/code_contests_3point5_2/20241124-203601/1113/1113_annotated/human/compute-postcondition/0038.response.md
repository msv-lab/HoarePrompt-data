Example Answer:
If the first character of `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1', and then '1' is appended to `nRow`. If the first character of `row` is not '9', `nRow` retains the value of the first character in `row`, and then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty; `nRow` is updated accordingly with an additional '1'.
Output State: **`row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty; `nRow` is updated accordingly with an additional '1'**
