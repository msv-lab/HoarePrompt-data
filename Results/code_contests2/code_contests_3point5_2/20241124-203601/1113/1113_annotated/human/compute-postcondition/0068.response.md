According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times regardless of the state. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`, or an empty string if `row` is empty. Since the loop will execute 9 times, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`, or an empty string if `row` is empty**
