According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` still has characters left to iterate over, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `row` contains a non-empty input string, `i` represents the first character in `row`. If the first character in `row` is '9', `nRow` contains the input string with '1' added at the end. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by concatenating the first character in `row`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` should still contain characters to iterate over. If the first character in `row` was '9', then `nRow` should contain the input string with '1' added at the end. Otherwise, `nRow` should be updated by concatenating the next character in `row`.

State: **`row` contains a non-empty input string, `i` represents the next character in `row`. If the next character in `row` is '9', `nRow` contains the input string with '1' added at the end. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by concatenating the next character in `row`.**
