According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 9. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`, `i` is 9**
