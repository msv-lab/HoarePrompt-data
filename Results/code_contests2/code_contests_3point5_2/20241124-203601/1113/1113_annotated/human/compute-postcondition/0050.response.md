Example Answer:
The variable `nRow` is initialized as an empty string. The value of `nRow` is not directly affected by the given code snippet. The variable `res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`, but the initial values of `res` and `row` are not provided. The variable `i` is 9, but it is not used in the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`, `i` is 9, and `nRow` is an empty string.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`, `i` is 9, and `nRow` is an empty string**
