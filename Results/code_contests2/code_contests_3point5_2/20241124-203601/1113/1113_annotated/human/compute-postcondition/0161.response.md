Example Answer: 
`nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is being concatenated with it, the value of `i` will be added to `nRow`. The character '9' is not present in the iterable object `row`, and the value of `i` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains the value of `i`. 
Output State: **`nRow` contains the value of `i`**
