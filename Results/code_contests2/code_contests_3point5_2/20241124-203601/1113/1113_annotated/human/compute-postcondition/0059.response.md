Example Answer:
The code appends the value of `i` to `nRow`. Based on the initial state, if `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', then the value of `i` is added to `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row` and the value of `i`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row` and the value of `i`**
