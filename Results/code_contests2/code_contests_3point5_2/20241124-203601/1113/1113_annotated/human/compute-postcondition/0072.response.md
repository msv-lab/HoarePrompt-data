Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The input is expected to be a string. The value of `row` will depend on the user input, but it is guaranteed to be a string. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a string, `nRow` contains the modified string based on the conditions.
Output State: **`row` is a string, `nRow` contains the modified string based on the conditions**
