Example Answer:
If the first character in `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` retains the value of the first character in `row`. Then `i` is added to `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is updated accordingly based on the condition and `i` is added to it.
Output State: **`row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is updated accordingly based on the condition and `i` is added to it**
