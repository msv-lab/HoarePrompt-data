Example Answer:
`row` is assigned the value returned by `input().strip()`, where `input()` accepts an input and `strip()` removes leading and trailing whitespaces. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `row` contains the input string without leading or trailing whitespaces.
Output State: **`row` contains the input string without leading or trailing whitespaces**
