Postcondition: ***`res` is a modified version of `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row` and the adjusted value of `i` for the next iteration. If `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`, otherwise `i` is appended to `nRow`. The state of `res` after the execution of the if else block covers all cases where '9' is present in `row` and the value of `i` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration.***
