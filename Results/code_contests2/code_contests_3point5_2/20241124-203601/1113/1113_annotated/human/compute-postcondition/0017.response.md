According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', and `nRow` has '1' appended to it if `i` is '9'. So for the loop to execute one more time, `nRow` should retain the updated value of '10' (appended by '1'). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` is '9', `row`, `nRow` is '10'**
