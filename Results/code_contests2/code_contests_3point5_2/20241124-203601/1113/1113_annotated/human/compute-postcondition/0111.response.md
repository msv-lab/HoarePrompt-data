According to the code, the loop can execute 9 times as it iterates over the range(9). At the end of the last iteration, the `res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable. If any element `i` in `row` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', `i` is appended to `nRow'. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable, `nRow` contains the elements processed so far in the current iteration, `row` contains the elements of the current row being processed in the loop**
