Postcondition: ***`row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty. If the first character `i` in `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` retains the value of the first character in `row` and 'i' is added to it. In any case, after the execution of the if else block, `nRow` is updated according to the conditions specified, ensuring that the first character of `row` dictates the value of `nRow` with 'i' potentially appended.***
