Example Answer: 
The value '1' is appended to the string `nRow`. Since `nRow` contains the updated values based on the conditions, the new value of `nRow` will have '1' added to it. The variable `res` also contains the updated `nRow`, so it will reflect the changes as well. The variable `row` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains the updated values with '1' added, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, and `row` is not empty and has more elements.
Output State: **`nRow` contains the updated values with '1' added, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` is not empty and has more elements**
