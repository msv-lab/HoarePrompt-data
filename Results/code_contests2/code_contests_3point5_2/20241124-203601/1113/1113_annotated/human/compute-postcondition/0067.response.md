Example Answer:
Initially, `res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`. If `row` contains '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow` for each occurrence of '9' in `row`. If `row` does not contain '9', then `nRow` remains the same as `row`. The loop will execute for each element in `row` to check if it is '9' and perform the necessary modifications to `nRow`. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute and `nRow` remains an empty string. The code appends the final `nRow` to `res`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`, or an empty string if `row` is empty.**
