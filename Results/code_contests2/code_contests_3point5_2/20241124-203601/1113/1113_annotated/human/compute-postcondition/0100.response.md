According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` list. If there are more elements in the `row` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` list has been updated with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable. `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is not empty. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is appended with `i`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in the `row` list after the last iteration. If there is another element in the `row` list, then the loop will execute again. Therefore, the next `i` element in the `row` list needs to be considered.

State: **Updated `res` list with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable. Next `i` is the next element in `row` list, `row` is not empty. If the next `i` is '9', then `nRow` will be appended with '1'. If the next `i` is not '9', then `nRow` will be appended with the next `i`.**
