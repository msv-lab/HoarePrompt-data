Example Answer:
`nRow` is assigned an empty string. The initial state mentions that '9' needs to be replaced with '1' in `nRow` after updating it with the input from the user. The value of `i` is 9, and `row` contains the user input. Therefore, the Output State is: Updated `res` list with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable, `i` is 9, `row` contains the user input.
Output State: **Updated `res` list with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable, `i` is 9, `row` contains the user input**
