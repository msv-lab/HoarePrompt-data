According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `res` list was updated with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 9.
State: **Updated `res` list with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable, `i` is 9**
