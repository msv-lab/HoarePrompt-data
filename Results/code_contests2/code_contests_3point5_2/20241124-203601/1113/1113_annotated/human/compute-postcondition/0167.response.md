According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If there are more elements left in `row`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` contains the value of the next element in `row`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '01'. Otherwise, `nRow` is appended by the value of `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `row` needs to be available to update `nRow`. 
State: **`nRow` contains the value of the next element in `row`**
