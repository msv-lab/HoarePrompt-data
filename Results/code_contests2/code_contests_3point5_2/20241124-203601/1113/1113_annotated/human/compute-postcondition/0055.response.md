Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the `nRow` variable. The initial state includes `res` containing the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`, `i` matching elements in `row`, `nRow` reflecting the initial state of `row`, and `i` not being equal to '9'. After executing the code, the `nRow` variable is modified by adding the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`, `i` matches elements in `row`, `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated by adding `i`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`, `i` matches elements in `row`, `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated by adding `i`**
