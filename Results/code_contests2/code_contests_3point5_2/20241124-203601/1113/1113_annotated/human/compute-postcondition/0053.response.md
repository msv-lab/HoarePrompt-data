Example Answer:
The code appends '1' to `nRow` if '9' is found in `row`. Since `i` is equal to '9' and `nRow` reflects the modified `row`, '1' is added to `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`, `i` matches elements in `row`, `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row` with '1' appended, and `i` is equal to '9'.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`, `i` matches elements in `row`, `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row` with '1' appended, and `i` is equal to '9'**
