According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` string. If the string `row` has at least 1 character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `nRow` being an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` has at least 1 character and `i` is the first character in `row`.
State: **`row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is the first character in `row`**
