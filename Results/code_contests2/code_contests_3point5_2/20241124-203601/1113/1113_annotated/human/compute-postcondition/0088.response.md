According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the `row` string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `row` has at least 3 characters, `i` is '9', `nRow` is the string formed by appending '1' to the end of `row`. If `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, '9' is appended to `nRow` after '1'. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `row` needs to be accessible in the next iteration.
State: **`row` is a string with at least 4 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is formed by appending '1' or '9' based on the next character in `row`.**
