Example Answer:
The value '1' is appended to the string `nRow`. Since `nRow` initially contained a non-empty string, the updated value of `nRow` will be the original string with '1' added at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` contains a non-empty input string, `i` represents the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is the original string with '1' appended at the end.
Output State: **`row` contains a non-empty input string, `i` represents the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is the original string with '1' appended at the end**
