Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the stripped input, which removes any leading or trailing whitespaces. The `row` now contains the elements of the current row. The other variables `res` list, `nRow`, and any replacements of '9' with '1' are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable, `nRow` contains the elements processed so far in the current iteration, and `row` contains the elements of the current row being processed in the loop.
Output State: **`res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable, `nRow` contains the elements processed so far in the current iteration, and `row` contains the elements of the current row being processed in the loop**
