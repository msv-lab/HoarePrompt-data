Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row` and the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row` with '1' appended. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row` with the addition of `i` to `nRow`. The overall program ensures that `res` is updated correctly based on the conditions specified, handling the cases where `i` is '9' or not, and appropriately modifying `nRow` accordingly.***
