Example Answer:
The value of `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The variable `row` now holds the user input. The previous values of the variables `res` and `i` are unknown, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Updated `res` list with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable, `i` is 9, `row` contains the user input.
Output State: **Updated `res` list with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable, `i` is 9, `row` contains the user input**
