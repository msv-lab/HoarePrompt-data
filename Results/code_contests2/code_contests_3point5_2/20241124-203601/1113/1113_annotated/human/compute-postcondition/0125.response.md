Example Answer: 
The code appends '1' to the existing value of `nRow`, which means '1' is added at the end of `nRow`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` list is updated with `nRow`, `nRow` is updated with any '9' replaced by '1' if applicable, `i` is the second element in `row`, `nRow` is appended with '1', and `row` contains more elements than the current iteration.
Output State: **`res` list is updated with `nRow`, `nRow` is updated with any '9' replaced by '1' if applicable, `i` is the second element in `row`, `nRow` is appended with '1', and `row` contains more elements than the current iteration**
