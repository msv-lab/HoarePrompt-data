Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1', so the value of `nRow` changes. Since `nRow` is initially a non-empty input string and '1' is concatenated to it, the new value of `nRow` will be the input string with '1' added at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` contains a non-empty input string, `i` represents the first character in `row`, the first character in `row` is '9', `nRow` contains the input string with '1' added at the end.
Output State: **`row` contains a non-empty input string, `i` represents the first character in `row`, the first character in `row` is '9', `nRow` contains the input string with '1' added at the end**
