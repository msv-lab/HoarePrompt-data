Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string, `i` is an integer, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` is not empty. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to contain '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to contain the value of `i`. In both cases, `i` is either 0 or 1 after the execution of the if-else block.***
