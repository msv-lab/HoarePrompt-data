According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is an iterable object, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nRow` being an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is an iterable object. 
State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `row` is an iterable object**
