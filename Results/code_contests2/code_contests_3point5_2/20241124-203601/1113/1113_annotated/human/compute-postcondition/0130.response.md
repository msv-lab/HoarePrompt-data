Example Answer:
The list `res` is appended with the list `nRow`. If the loop executes and replaces any '9' with '1', then `nRow` will contain the elements of `row` with '9' replaced by '1'. If the loop does not start due to an empty `row`, `res` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable. If the loop does not start due to an empty `row`, `res` remains unchanged.**
