According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are still elements in the `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a string, `i` is an integer, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` is not empty. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to contain '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to contain the value of `i'. In both cases, `i` is either 0 or 1 after the execution of the if-else block. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `i` should be updated to either 0 or 1 depending on the next element in `row`.
State: **`nRow` is a string, `i` is either 0 or 1, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` is not empty**
