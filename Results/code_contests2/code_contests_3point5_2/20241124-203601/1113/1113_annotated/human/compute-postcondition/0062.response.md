Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is modified by adding '1' to it. The previous value of `nRow` is not provided, so the output state is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row` and the adjusted value of `i` for the next iteration.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row` and the adjusted value of `i` for the next iteration**
