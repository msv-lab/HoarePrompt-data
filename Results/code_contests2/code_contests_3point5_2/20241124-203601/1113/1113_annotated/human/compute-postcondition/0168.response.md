Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the string '1'. If the initial value of `nRow` is '2', after execution, `nRow` will be '21'. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains the value of the next element in `row` appended with '1'.
Output State: **`nRow` contains the value of the next element in `row` appended with '1'**
