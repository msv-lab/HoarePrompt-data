Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the string representation of `i`, where `i` is either 0 or 1. If `i` is 0, then the resulting `nRow` will be the original `nRow` followed by "0". If `i` is 1, then the resulting `nRow` will be the original `nRow` followed by "1". The variable `res` contains the updated `nRow`, and `row` is not empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is the original string followed by either "0" or "1", `i` is either 0 or 1, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` is not empty.
Output State: **`nRow` is the original string followed by either "0" or "1", `i` is either 0 or 1, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` is not empty**
