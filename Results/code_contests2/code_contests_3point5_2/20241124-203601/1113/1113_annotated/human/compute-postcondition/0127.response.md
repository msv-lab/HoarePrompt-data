Postcondition: ***`res` list is updated with `nRow`, `nRow` is updated with any '9' replaced by '1' if applicable, `i` is the second element in `row`, `nRow` is appended with '1', and `row` contains more elements than the current iteration. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, `i` is appended to `nRow`. In either case, the updated `nRow` is added to `res` list.***
