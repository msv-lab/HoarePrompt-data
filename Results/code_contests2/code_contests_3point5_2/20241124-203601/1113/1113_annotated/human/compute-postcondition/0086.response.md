Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the value of `i`, which is '9'. Therefore, the value of `nRow` becomes the original `row` with '1' appended, followed by '9'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`row` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is '9', `nRow` is the string formed by appending '1' to the end of `row` followed by '9'**
