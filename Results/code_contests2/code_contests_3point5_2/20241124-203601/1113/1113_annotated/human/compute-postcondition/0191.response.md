According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a string containing the updated values, `i` is equal to '9' or not, and `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` is not empty and has more elements. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, if `i` is not equal to '9', `i` should be appended to `nRow`. Additionally, the loop should be able to iterate over the next element in `row`, so the updated `nRow` would depend on whether the next element in `row` satisfies the condition for `i` being equal to '9' or not.
State: **`nRow` is a string containing the updated values based on the next element in `row`, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` is not empty and has more elements.**
