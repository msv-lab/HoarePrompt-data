According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `row`. If the row has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `nRow` is an empty string, `row` contains at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element in `row`.
State: **`res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` contains at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `row**.
