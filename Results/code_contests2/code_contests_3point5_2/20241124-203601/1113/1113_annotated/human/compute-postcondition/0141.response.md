Example Answer:
`nRow` is assigned the concatenation of `nRow` and `i`, where `i` represents the first character in `row`. The value of `i` is not specified, but it is mentioned that the first character in `row` is not equal to '9'. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` contains a non-empty input string, `i` represents the first character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by concatenating the first character in `row`.
Output State: **`row` contains a non-empty input string, `i` represents the first character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by concatenating the first character in `row`**
