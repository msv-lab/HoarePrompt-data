According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variable `row`. If `i` is '9', `row` is '10', and `nRow` is '101'. If `i` is not '9', `row` is '109'. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', `row` is '10', and `nRow` is '101'. To execute the loop one more time, `row` should be adjusted to '11' if `i` is '9'. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` is '9', `row` is '11', `nRow` is '101' if `i` is '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` is '109'**
