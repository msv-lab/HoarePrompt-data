Postcondition: ***`res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` retains the value of the first element in `row`. `row` contains at least 1 element and `i` is the first element in `row`. If `i` is '9', the '9' is replaced by '1' in `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` remains unchanged.***
