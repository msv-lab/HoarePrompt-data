Output State: **`row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty. If there is at least one occurrence of '9' in `row`, each '9' is replaced with '1' in `nRow`, otherwise `nRow` is the same as `row`. The loop will always execute, ensuring that `nRow` reflects the modifications based on the presence of '9' in `row`.**
