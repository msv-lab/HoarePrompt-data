According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the updated `res` list with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty and `i` is the first element in `row`.
State: **Updated `res` list with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is not empty**
