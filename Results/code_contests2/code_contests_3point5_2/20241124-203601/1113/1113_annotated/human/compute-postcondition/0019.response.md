Example Answer: 
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is '9', so after execution, `nRow` becomes '109'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` is '9', `row`, `nRow` is '109'.
Output State: **`sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` is '9', `row`, `nRow` is '109'**
