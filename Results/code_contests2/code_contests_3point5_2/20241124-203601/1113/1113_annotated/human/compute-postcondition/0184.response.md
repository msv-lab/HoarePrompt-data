Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially a string, it will now contain the updated string with '1' added to the end. The value of `i` remains unaffected and is either 0 or 1. The variable `res` now contains the updated `nRow`. The variable `row` is not changed and is still not empty.
Output State: **`nRow` is an updated string, `i` is either 0 or 1, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` is not empty**
