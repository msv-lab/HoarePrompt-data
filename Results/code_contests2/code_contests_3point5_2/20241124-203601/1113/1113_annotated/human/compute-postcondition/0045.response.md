According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty. The first character in `row` dictates the value of `nRow`. If the first character `i` in `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` retains the value of the first character in `row` and 'i' is added to it. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the updated value of `nRow` based on the first character of `row` needs to be determined.
State: **`row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty**.
