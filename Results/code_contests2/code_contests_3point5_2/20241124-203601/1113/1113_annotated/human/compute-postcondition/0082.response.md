Example Answer: 
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The initial state of `nRow` is a string with at least 2 characters, and the value of `i` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is updated according to the value of `i`.
Output State: **`nRow` is updated according to the value of `i`**
