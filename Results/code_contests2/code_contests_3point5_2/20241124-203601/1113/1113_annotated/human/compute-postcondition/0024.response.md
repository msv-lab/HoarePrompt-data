Postcondition: ***`sys.stdout`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are all '9', `row` is '11', `nRow` is '1011' if `i` is '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` is '1091' if `i` is not '9'. In the case `i` is '9', nRow has '1' appended to its original value. In the else case, nRow has the value of `i` appended to its original value.***
