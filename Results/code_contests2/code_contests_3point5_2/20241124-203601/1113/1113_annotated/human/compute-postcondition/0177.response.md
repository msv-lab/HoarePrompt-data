According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nRow` is an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty. Additionally, since `i` is used as an index variable in the loop, it should be adjusted to reflect the index of the first element in `row`. In this case, `i` should be 0. 
State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` is not empty**
