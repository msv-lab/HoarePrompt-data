Postcondition: ***`res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', `i` is appended to `nRow`. The variables `res`, `nRow`, `i`, and `row` maintain their initial relationships and values as described in the precondition. All possible cases, including the boundary values of '9', are handled in the program logic.***
