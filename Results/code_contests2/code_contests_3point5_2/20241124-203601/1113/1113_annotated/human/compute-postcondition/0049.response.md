Example Answer:
The input function takes an input and assigns it to the variable `row`. The value of `i` which is 9, is not utilized in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`, `i` is 9.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row`, `i` is 9**
