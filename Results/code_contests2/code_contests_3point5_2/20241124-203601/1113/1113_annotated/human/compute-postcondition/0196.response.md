According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is greater than the current value of `t`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop executed 9 times and `row` was a non-empty string. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `T` should be greater than 9. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute 9 times, `T` is greater than 9.**
