According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of `i`, which is from 0 to 8 (inclusive). For the loop to execute, it does not depend on the state of `row` or `res`, as the loop will always run for the given range. Therefore, no adjustment to the state is required for the loop to execute.

State: **No adjustment needed for `row` or `res`**
