Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it. The value of `i` represents the next character in `row`, and `row` contains a non-empty input string. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will contain the updated string based on the addition of the next character in `row`. 
Output State: **`row` contains a non-empty input string, `i` represents the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`.**
