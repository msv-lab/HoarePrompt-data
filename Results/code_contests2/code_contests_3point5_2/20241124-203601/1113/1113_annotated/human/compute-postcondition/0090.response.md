Example Answer:
If `row` contains characters and has at least one character, `nRow` will be updated by replacing any occurrence of '9' with '1' in `row`. If `row` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string. After execution, the updated `nRow` will be appended to the `res` list.
Output State: **Updated `res` list with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable**
