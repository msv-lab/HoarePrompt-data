Example Answer:
The value of `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The variable `nRow` contains the value of each element in `row`, which is not affected by this operation. The value of `i` is 9 and `res` contains the updated `nRow` after the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is a string that contains the value of each element in `row`, `i` is 9, `res` contains the updated `nRow` after the operation.
Output State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the value of each element in `row`, `i` is 9, `res` contains the updated `nRow` after the operation**
