Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but the value of `i` is provided for calculations. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row` and the adjusted value of `i` for the next iteration.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row` and the adjusted value of `i` for the next iteration**
