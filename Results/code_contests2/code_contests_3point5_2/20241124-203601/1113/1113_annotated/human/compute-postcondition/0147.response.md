According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the `row` string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `row` contains a non-empty input string, `i` represents the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', '1' is added at the end of `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', the next character in `row` is concatenated to `nRow`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the last character `i` in `row` was '9', then '1' was added at the end of `nRow`, so the next character in `row` should be concatenated to `nRow`.
- If the last character `i` in `row` was not '9', then the next character in `row` was concatenated to `nRow`.

State: **`row` contains a non-empty input string, `i` represents the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`.**
