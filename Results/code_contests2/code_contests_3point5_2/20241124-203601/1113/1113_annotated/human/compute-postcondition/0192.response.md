Output State: **`nRow` is a string containing the updated values based on the conditions within the loop. If `i` is equal to '9', '1' is added to `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', `i` is appended to `nRow`. `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` is not empty and has more elements. If `row` is empty, the loop won't execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string. If `i` is not 9 in the initial state, the loop won't execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string.**
