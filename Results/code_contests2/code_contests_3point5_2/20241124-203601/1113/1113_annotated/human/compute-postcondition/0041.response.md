According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input string `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty. If the first character `i` in `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` retains the value of the first character in `row` and 'i' is added to it. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must still be a non-empty string and `nRow` should be updated to '1' if the first character `i` in `row` is '9'. If the first character is not '9', then `nRow` should retain the value of the first character in `row` and 'i' should be added to it.

State: **`row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty. If the first character `i` in `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` retains the value of the first character in `row` and 'i' is added to it**
