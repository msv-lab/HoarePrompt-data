According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `row` list and the value of `i`. If there are more elements in `row` to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row` and the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row` with '1' appended. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row`, and `i` is added to `nRow`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row` and the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row` with '1' appended. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row` with the addition of `i` to `nRow`.**
