According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the `row`. At the end of the previous iteration, `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty. Additionally, if the first character `i` in `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1', otherwise `nRow` retains the value of the first character in `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state at the start of the next iteration should ensure that there are more characters left in `row` and the relationship between `row`, `nRow`, and `i` is maintained as described. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty. If the first character `i` in `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` retains the value of the first character in `row`.**
