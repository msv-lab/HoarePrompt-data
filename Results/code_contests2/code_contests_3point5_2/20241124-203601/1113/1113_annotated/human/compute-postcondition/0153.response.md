Example Answer:
If `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` will contain the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'. If `row` is an empty string, `nRow` will remain empty. The `nRow` string is appended to the list `res`. 
Output State: **If `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` contains the modified string with '9's replaced by '1's, and it is appended to the list `res`. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains empty.**
