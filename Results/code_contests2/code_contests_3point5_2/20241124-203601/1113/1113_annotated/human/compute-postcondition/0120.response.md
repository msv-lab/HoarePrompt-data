According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `row` list and the value of `i`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` retains the value of the first element in `row`. `row` contains at least 1 element and `i` is the first element in `row`. If `i` is '9', the '9' is replaced by '1' in `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` remains unchanged.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` retains the value of the first element in `row`. `row` contains at least 1 element, and `i` is the second element in `row`. If the second element in `row` is '9', the '9' is replaced by '1' in `nRow`. If the second element in `row` is not '9', `nRow` remains unchanged.**
