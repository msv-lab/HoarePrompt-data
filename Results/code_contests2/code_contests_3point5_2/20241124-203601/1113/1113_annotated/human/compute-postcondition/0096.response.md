Example Answer: 
After executing the code, '9' in `nRow` is replaced with '1' if applicable. The value of `nRow` is updated by adding '1'. The value of `i` is the first element in `row` which is '9'. Since `row` is not empty, the operation is successful. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable, `i` is the first element in `row` which is '9', `row` is not empty, `nRow` has been appended with '1'.
Output State: **`res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1' if applicable, `i` is the first element in `row` which is '9', `row` is not empty, `nRow` has been appended with '1'**
