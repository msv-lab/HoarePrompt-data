Example Answer: 
The `atexit.register` function registers a lambda function that writes the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output (1) using `os.write` before the program exits. As a result, the contents of `sys.stdout` will be written to the standard output when the program finishes execution. The initial state remains unchanged.
Output State: **`sys.stdout` is assigned to `io.BytesIO()`**
