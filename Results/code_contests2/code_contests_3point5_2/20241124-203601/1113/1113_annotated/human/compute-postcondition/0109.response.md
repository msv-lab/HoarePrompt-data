Output State: **`res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable. If any element `i` in `row` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', `i` is appended to `nRow`. The variables `res`, `nRow`, `i`, and `row` maintain their initial relationships and values as described in the precondition. The loop will execute at least once if `row` is not empty. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the values remain the same as in the initial state. All possible cases, including the boundary values of '9', are handled in the program logic.**
