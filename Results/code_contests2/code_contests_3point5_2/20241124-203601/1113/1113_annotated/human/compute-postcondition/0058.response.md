Example Answer: 
`nRow` is appended with '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but after executing the code, `nRow` will have '1' appended to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row` and the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row` with '1' appended. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row` with the addition of `i` to `nRow`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` based on the presence of '9' in `row` and the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row` with '1' appended. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` reflects the initial state of `row` with the addition of `i` to `nRow`.**
