Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the end of `nRow`, which contains the updated values based on the conditions. The `res` variable also contains the updated `nRow`. The `row` variable is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains the updated values based on the conditions with `i` appended, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` is not empty and has more elements.
Output State: **`nRow` contains the updated values based on the conditions with `i` appended, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` is not empty and has more elements**
