According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 9, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable. If the loop does not start due to an empty `row`, `res` remains unchanged. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than 8.
State: **`res` list is updated with `nRow` after replacing any '9' with '1' if applicable, `i` is less than 8**
