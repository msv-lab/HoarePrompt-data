According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the `row` string. At the end of the last iteration, `row` contains a non-empty input string, `i` represents the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to the end of `nRow`. Otherwise, `i` is appended to `nRow`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next character `i` needs to be considered. If there are more characters left in the `row` string, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the next character `i` in `row`.
State: **`row` contains a non-empty input string, `i` represents the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`.**
