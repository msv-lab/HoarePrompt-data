According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `i` equals '9', the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a string with at least 2 characters. So for the loop to execute one more time, `row` needs to have at least 3 characters and the value of `i` must be '9'.
State: **`row` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is '9', `nRow` is the string formed by appending '1' to the end of `row`**
