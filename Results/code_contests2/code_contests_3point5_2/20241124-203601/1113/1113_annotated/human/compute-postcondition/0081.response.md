Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the character '1', so if the initial value of `row` is 'abc', then after execution `nRow` would be 'abc1'. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a string with at least 2 characters; `nRow` is a string with the appended character '1'.
Output State: **`row` is a string with at least 2 characters; `nRow` is a string with the appended character '1'**
