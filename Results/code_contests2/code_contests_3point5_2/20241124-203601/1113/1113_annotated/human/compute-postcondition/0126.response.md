Example Answer:
Initially, `nRow` is updated with any '9' replaced by '1', `i` is the second element in `row`, `nRow` is appended with '1', and `row` contains more elements than the current iteration. After executing `nRow += i`, the value of `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. 
Output State: **`res` list is updated with `nRow`, `nRow` is updated with any '9' replaced by '1' if applicable, `i` is the second element in `row`, `nRow` is appended with '1', `row` contains more elements than the current iteration, and `nRow` is concatenated with `i`.**
