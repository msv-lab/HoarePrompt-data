Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described. The code simply replaces '9' with '1' in each row of the sudoku puzzle, which does not guarantee that the resulting puzzle is an anti-sudoku. The conditions for an anti-sudoku are not met by just replacing '9' with '1' in each row. Hence, the code is incorrect.
