The function does not accept any parameters. It modifies the input rows by replacing '9' with '1' and appends the modified rows to a list. If the input T is greater than 0, it prints the modified rows separated by newline characters. If T is 0 or negative, it does not print anything. The function lacks a return value and relies on printing the modified rows directly.
