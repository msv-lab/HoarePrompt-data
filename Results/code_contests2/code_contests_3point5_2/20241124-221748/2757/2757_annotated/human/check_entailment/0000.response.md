Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a character is a consonant or not by returning True if the character is not a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). This logic is in line with the problem description where consonants are defined as all letters except 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Since the function implements the required logic accurately, the program can correctly identify typos in words and insert spaces as needed to correct them.
