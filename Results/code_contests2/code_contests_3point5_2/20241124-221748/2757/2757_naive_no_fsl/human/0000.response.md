Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully adhere to the problem description. The program only checks for blocks of three consecutive consonants, but the problem description states that a word is considered to have a typo if there is a block of not less than three consonants with at least two different letters. 

The program does not handle cases where there are more than three consecutive consonants with at least two different letters. For example, if the input word is "hellooo", the program will not detect it as a typo since it only checks for blocks of three consecutive consonants.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not cover all the cases mentioned in the problem description.
