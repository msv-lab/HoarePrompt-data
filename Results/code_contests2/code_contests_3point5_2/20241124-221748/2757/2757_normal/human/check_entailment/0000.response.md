Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the problem description for all potential cases. The code only checks for blocks of three consonants in a row with at least two different letters, but it does not handle the case where the block of consonants has all letters the same. In such cases, the block should not be considered a typo according to the problem description. The code does not consider this exception and incorrectly adds spaces in such cases.
