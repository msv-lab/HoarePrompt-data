Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a single character 'ch' from the English alphabet. It returns True if the character is not a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), otherwise it returns False. The code accurately implements this functionality by checking if the character is not in the string 'aeiou' to determine if it is a vowel. **
