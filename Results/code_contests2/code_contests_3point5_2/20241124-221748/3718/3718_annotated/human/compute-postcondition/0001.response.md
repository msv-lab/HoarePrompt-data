The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. **Precondition**: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| â‰¤ 104. After executing the function body, the program returns the Euclidean distance between points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four integer parameters representing two sets of coordinates and return the Euclidean distance between the two points.
