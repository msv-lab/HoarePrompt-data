Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points based on their coordinates. This function is essential for determining the minimum detection radius of the radar in the problem description. The Euclidean distance calculation is a fundamental mathematical operation that is correctly implemented in the program. Since the program only consists of this function and it is accurately implemented, we can conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
