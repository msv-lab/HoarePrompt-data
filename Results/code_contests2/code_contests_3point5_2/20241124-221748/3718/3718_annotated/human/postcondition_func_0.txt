The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, representing two sets of coordinates. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the distance formula. The function does not have any specific constraints on the input parameters other than being integers.
