The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `x1, y1, x2, y2`, all of which are integers such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| <= 10^4. After executing the function body, the program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept four integer parameters representing coordinates of two points and return the Euclidean distance between them. 
Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters representing coordinates of two points and returns the Euclidean distance between them.**
