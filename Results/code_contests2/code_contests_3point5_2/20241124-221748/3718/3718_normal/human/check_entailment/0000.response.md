Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input for the city and flatland ring coordinates and distances.
- It calculates the distance between the two points using the `func_1()` function which correctly implements the Euclidean distance formula.
- The code then calculates the minimum detection radius based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
- The output is formatted to display the minimum detection radius with 6 decimal points precision.
- The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the radar can register the start of movements of both flatland rings.
