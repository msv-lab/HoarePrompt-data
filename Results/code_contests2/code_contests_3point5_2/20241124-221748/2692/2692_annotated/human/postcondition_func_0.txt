The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an even integer `n` in the range [2, 50] from the user input and a list of integers `digits`. It then checks if the sum of the first half of `digits` is equal to the sum of the second half. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles all cases where `n` is within the specified range and correctly divides `digits` into two halves for comparison. The function lacks a return statement, so it does not explicitly return any value.
