Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `digits` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input string after stripping. If the sum of the first half of the elements in `digits` is equal to the sum of the second half of the elements in `digits`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The program handles all cases where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 50, and the input list `digits` is divided into two halves based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 2, the program correctly compares the two elements. In the case where `n` is at the boundary of 50, the program handles the division of `digits` appropriately. The output 'YES' or 'NO' is determined by the equality of the sums, encompassing all possible scenarios within the specified range of `n` and the characteristics of the input list `digits`.***
