Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where the ticket number is a lucky number (contains only 4 or 7) but the sum of digits in the first half does not equal the sum of digits in the second half. For example, if the ticket number is 4744, the sum of digits in the first half (4 + 7) is not equal to the sum of digits in the second half (4 + 4). The program will incorrectly output "YES" in such cases.
