Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads an even integer `n` and a ticket number as input. It then splits the ticket number into two halves and checks if the sum of the digits in the first half is equal to the sum of the digits in the second half. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The code handles all cases as described in the problem statement, including scenarios where `n` is odd by considering the middle digit in the sum calculation. The output hints also agree with the code in terms of its functionality. Since there are no instances where the code deviates from the problem description, the correctness is considered True.
