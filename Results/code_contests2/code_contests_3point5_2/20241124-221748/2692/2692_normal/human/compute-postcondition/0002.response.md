Example Answer:
The code snippet converts the input string into a list of integers. Since the ticket number is an integer of length n, after execution, digits will contain n elements, each being a digit of the ticket number. Since n is given to be an even integer between 2 and 50, the length of digits will be equal to n. 
Output State: **digits contains n elements, each being a digit of the ticket number**
