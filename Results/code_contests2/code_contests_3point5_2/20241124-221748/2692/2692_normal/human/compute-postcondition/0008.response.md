Postcondition: ***n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. The ticket number is an integer of length n. If the sum of the digits in the first half of the ticket number is equal to the sum of the digits in the second half, the program prints 'YES'. In all other cases, including when n is odd, the program prints 'NO', ensuring correct output based on the sum of the digits in each half of the ticket number.***
