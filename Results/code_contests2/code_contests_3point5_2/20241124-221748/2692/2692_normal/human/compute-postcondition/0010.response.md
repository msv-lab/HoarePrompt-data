Functionality: **The function `func` reads an even integer `n` and a ticket number as input. It then splits the ticket number into two halves and checks if the sum of the digits in the first half is equal to the sum of the digits in the second half. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function covers all cases, including when `n` is odd, by appropriately handling the sum of digits in each half of the ticket number.**
