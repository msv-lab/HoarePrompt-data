Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly check if the ticket number is lucky according to the problem description. The issue lies in the way the digits are read and compared. The program reads the ticket number as a single integer and then tries to split it into digits, but this will not work correctly for ticket numbers with leading zeros.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
0477
```

The program will read this as the integer 477, not 0477, and will incorrectly output "NO" even though the ticket number should be considered lucky.

To fix this issue, the program should read the input as a string and split it into individual digits.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle cases with leading zeros properly.
