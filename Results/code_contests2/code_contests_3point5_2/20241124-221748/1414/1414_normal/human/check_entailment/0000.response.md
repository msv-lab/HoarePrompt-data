Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes input values for k, a, b, and v and then calculates the minimum number of boxes needed to put all the nuts into boxes based on the constraints provided in the problem description. It follows the logic of distributing nuts into boxes while considering the maximum number of sections in a box and the number of divisors available. The code iteratively calculates the result until all nuts are distributed. Since the code follows the problem description and there are no apparent cases where it fails to provide the correct output, we can conclude that the code is correct.
