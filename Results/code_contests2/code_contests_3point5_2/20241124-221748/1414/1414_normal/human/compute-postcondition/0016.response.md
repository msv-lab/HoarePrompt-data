Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting `k * v` from its current value. The initial values of `a`, `k`, and `v` are 1, 2, and 3 respectively. After execution, the new value of `a` would be 1 - 2 * 3 = -5. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is 2, `a` is -5, `b` is 1, `v` is 3, `res` is 2.
Output State: **`k` is 2, `a` is -5, `b` is 1, `v` is 3, `res` is 2**
