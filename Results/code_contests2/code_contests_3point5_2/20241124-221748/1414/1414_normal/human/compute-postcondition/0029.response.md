Example Answer:
The value of `a` is decreased by `v`, where `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000. The new value of `a` is `a - v`. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000, and `res` is 3, `a` is updated to `a - v`.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000, and `res` is 3, `a` is updated to `a - v`**
