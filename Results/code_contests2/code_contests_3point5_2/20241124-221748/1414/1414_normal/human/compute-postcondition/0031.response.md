Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000, and `res` is 3. If b ≥ k, `a` is decreased by the product of `k` and `v`, `b` is decreased by (k - 1), `v` remains unchanged, and `res` is 3. If 0 < b < k, `a` is updated to a minus the product of (b + 1) and v, and `b` is set to 0. If b ≤ 0, `a` is updated to a minus v.***
