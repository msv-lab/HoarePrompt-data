Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000, and `res` is 2. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to a - k * v, and `b` is updated to b - (k - 1). If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is updated to a - (b + 1) * v, and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is updated to a - v.***
