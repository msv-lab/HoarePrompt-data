Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes input values for k, a, b, and v.
2. It then iterates using a while loop to distribute the nuts into boxes.
3. The program calculates the number of boxes needed according to the constraints provided in the problem description.
4. The program keeps track of the remaining nuts and divisors after each box is filled.
5. Finally, it prints the minimum number of boxes required to distribute all the nuts.

The program seems to be correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement. It handles different scenarios based on the number of divisors available and the capacity of each section of the box.
