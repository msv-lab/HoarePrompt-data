Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000, and `res` is initialized to 2. After the execution of the code fragment, `res` is increased by 1. If b >= k, `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` is increased by 1. If b > 0 but b < k, `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`, `b` is set to 0, and `res` is increased by 1. If b ≤ 0, `a` is updated to `a - v`, and `res` is increased by 1.***
