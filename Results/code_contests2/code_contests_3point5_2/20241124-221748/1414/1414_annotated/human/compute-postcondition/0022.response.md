Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000, and `res` is initialized to 2. After the execution of the code fragment, the following changes occur: if b ≥ k, `a` is updated to a - k * v, and `b` is updated to b - (k - 1). If 0 < b < k, `a` is updated to a - (b + 1) * v, and `b` is set to 0. If b ≤ 0, `a` is decreased by `v`.***
