Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000, `res` is initialized to 2. After the execution of the code fragment, `res` is increased by 1. If b > 0, `a` is decreased by (b + 1) * v and `b` is set to 0. If b is not greater than 0, `a` is decreased by v.***
