Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000, and `res` is initialized to 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` remains 1. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`, `b` becomes 0, and `res` remains 1. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is updated to `a - v`, and `res` remains 1.***
