Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes input values for the maximum number of sections in a box, the number of nuts, the number of divisors, and the capacity of each section of the box. It then calculates the minimum number of boxes required to put all the nuts in boxes based on the given constraints. The program uses a while loop to iterate until all nuts are placed in boxes. It correctly handles the cases where divisors are applied to boxes to create sections and distributes nuts accordingly. The logic of updating the variables `a` and `b` based on the conditions provided in the problem description is correctly implemented. The program outputs the correct answer by printing the number of boxes used.

Based on the problem description and the provided examples, the program works correctly for all potential cases and adheres to the requirements.
