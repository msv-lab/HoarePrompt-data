Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of boxes required to put all the nuts in boxes while considering the constraints of maximum sections in a box, maximum nuts per section, and the number of divisors available. It iterates over the number of nuts and adjusts the number of divisors and nuts accordingly to meet the requirements. The logic of distributing nuts into boxes based on the number of divisors and the capacity of each section seems to be correct for all potential cases.
