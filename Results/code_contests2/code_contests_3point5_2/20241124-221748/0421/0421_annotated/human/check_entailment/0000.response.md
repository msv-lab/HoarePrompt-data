Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the described algorithm. The program only checks for adjacent elements in the input array with an absolute difference of at least 2 and then removes the maximum element. It does not consider the sliding of ravioli as described in the problem statement.

An example where the program fails:
Input:
3
3 1 2

Output should be "NO" according to the problem description because the ravioli from stack of height 3 will slide on the stack of height 1, and the algorithm will output an array {2, 2, 2}. However, the program will output "YES" in this case.
