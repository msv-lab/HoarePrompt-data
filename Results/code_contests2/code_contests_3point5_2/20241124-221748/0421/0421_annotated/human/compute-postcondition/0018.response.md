Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` contains the list of integers with the maximum element removed. If there exists a pair of adjacent elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of at least 2, then `flag` is set to False and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `flag` remains True after the loop executes. If `nums` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `flag` remains True.**
