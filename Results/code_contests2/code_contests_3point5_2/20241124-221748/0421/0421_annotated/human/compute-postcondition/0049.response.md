Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, and `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` remains False and the program breaks out of the loop.***
