According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `n` is still a positive integer, `ai` is still a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `i` is 0. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `n` is still a positive integer, `ai` is still a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `i` is 1**
