According to the code, the loop can execute if both `flag` and `nums` are True. If there are less than 2 elements in `nums`, the loop does not execute. If the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `nums` is less than 2, then `flag` remains True after the loop execution. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the `flag` needs to be True and `nums` should not be empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **No adjustments needed as the loop does not execute due to less than 2 elements in `nums`.**
