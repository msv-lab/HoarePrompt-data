Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 2 elements, `n` is still a positive integer, `ai` is still a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the loop breaks.***
