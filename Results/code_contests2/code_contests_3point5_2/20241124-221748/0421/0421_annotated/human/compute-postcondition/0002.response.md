Example Answer:
The code reads a list of integers from input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variable `nums`. The previous values of `n`, `ai`, and `flag` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of positive integers, flag is True, nums contains the list of integers from input.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of positive integers, flag is True, nums contains the list of integers from input**
