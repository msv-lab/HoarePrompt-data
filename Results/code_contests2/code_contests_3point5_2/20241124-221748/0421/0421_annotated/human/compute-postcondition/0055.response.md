Output State: If the loop executes and flag is True, then `n` remains a positive integer, `ai` remains a list of positive integers, and `flag` will be False. The loop will continue removing the maximum value from `nums` until either `flag` becomes False or `nums` has less than 2 elements. If `nums` has less than 2 elements at the beginning, the initial state remains unchanged.
