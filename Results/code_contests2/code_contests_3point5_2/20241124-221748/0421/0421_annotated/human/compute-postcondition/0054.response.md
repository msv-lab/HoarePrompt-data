Output State: **If there are at least 2 elements in `nums`, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `n` remains a positive integer, `ai` remains a list of positive integers, `flag` will be True if there are no pairs of adjacent elements with an absolute difference of at least 2 in `nums`, otherwise `flag` will be False. The loop will continue removing the maximum value from `nums` until either `flag` becomes False or `nums` has less than 2 elements. If `nums` has less than 2 elements at the beginning, the loop will not execute and the initial state remains unchanged.**
