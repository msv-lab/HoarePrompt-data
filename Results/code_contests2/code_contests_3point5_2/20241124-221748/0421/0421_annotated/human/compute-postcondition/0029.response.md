According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `nums` and the conditions related to the elements in the list `ai`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, and `ai` is a list of positive integers. The loop will execute one more time if the length of `nums` is at least 2 and the conditions related to the elements in `ai` are not violated. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `nums` must be at least 2 and the condition related to the elements in `ai` must not be violated.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, length of `nums` is at least 2, and the conditions related to elements in `ai` are satisfied**
