According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` contains the list of integers from input with length at least 2, and `i` is 3**
