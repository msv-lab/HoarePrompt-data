According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `nums` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` contains the list of integers from input with length at least 2, and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` contains the list of integers from input with length at least 2, `i` is 0**
