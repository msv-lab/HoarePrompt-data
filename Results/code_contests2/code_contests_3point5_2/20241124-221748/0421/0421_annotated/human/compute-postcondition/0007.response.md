Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True. `nums` contains the list of integers from input with length at least 2, and `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the loop is broken. All other variables retain their initial values and relationships.***
