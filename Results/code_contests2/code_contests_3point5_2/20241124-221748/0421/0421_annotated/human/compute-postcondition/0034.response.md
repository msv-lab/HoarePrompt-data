Output State: 
- If the length of `nums` is less than 2, the loop will not execute, and `flag` will remain True. 
- If the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2` is met at any point during the loop, `flag` will be set to False, and the loop will break. 
- After the loop executes, `n` will still be a positive integer, `ai` will remain a list of positive integers, and `flag` will be True unless the condition mentioned above is met during the loop execution.
