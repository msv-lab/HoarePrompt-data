Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, and `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` remains False and the loop breaks. The state of the program variables remains unchanged after the execution of the if statement, ensuring the preconditions are preserved.***
