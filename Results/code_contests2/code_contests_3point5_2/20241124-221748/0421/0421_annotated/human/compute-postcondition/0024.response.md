Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True. If the absolute difference between the ith and (i+1)th elements of `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the loop is broken. The condition holds true for all possible edge cases where `n` remains positive, `ai` contains positive integers, `flag` remains True, `nums` has at least 2 integers, and `i` is within the bounds of the length of `nums`.***
