According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the index `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, and `i` is 1. Since the loop will execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2 to satisfy the loop condition.
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, and `i` is 2**
