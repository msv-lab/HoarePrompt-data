According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the condition mentioned in the loop body is not met. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True. If the absolute difference between the ith and (i+1)th elements of `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False. So for the loop to execute one more time, the condition mentioned should not be met. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True**
