According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `nums` is at least 2. Since the loop is iterating up to `len(nums) - 1`, it means there must be at least 2 elements in `nums` for the loop to execute. Therefore, the conditions to adjust for the loop to execute one more time are that `nums` should contain at least 2 integers and `i` should be less than the length of `nums`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` contains at least 2 integers, `i` is less than the length of `nums`**
