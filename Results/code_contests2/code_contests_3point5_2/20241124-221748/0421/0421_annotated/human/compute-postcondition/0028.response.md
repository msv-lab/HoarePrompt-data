Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers. If the absolute difference between `ai[i]` and `ai[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop. This ensures that the program handles the scenario where the difference between consecutive elements in the list exceeds 2 and updates the flag accordingly.***
