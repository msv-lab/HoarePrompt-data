According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` contains the list of integers from input with length at least 2, and `i` is 0. The condition for breaking the loop is if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, in which case `flag` is set to False.

Since the loop is to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next index. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` contains the list of integers from input with length at least 2, and `i` is 1**
