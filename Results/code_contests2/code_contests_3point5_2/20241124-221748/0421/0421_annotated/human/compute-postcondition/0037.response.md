According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `nums` is not empty. Before the loop starts, the maximum value has been removed from `nums`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least 2 elements. Additionally, the loop condition depends on `i` and `nums`, so at the start of the loop, `i` should be 0 to ensure the loop starts from the beginning. Since `flag` remains True unless a specific condition is met during loop execution, it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `n` is still a positive integer, `ai` is still a list of positive integers, `flag` remains True, `i` is 0**
