According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has the maximum value removed, `n` is still a positive integer, `ai` is still a list of positive integers, and `flag` remains True unless the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2` is met during the loop execution. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the `nums` list should not be empty.
State: **`nums` has the maximum value removed, `n` is still a positive integer, `ai` is still a list of positive integers, `flag` remains True unless the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2` is met during the loop execution, and `nums` is not empty**
