The function `func` reads an input integer `n`, followed by a list of integers. It then checks if there are adjacent elements in the list with an absolute difference of at least 2. If such pairs exist, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. However, the code does not handle the case where there are less than 2 elements in the list `nums`, which is a potential edge case.
