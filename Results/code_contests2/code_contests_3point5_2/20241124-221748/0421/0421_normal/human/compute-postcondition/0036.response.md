According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` list has the maximum value removed, `i` is an index in the range of `nums`, and `flag` remains False if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the maximum value should be removed again from the `nums` list, `i` should still be within the range of `nums`, and `flag` should remain False based on the condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` list has the maximum value removed, `i` is an index in the range of `nums`, `flag` remains False if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2**
