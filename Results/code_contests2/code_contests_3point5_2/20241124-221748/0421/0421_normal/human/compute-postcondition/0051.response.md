Output State: **If nums has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and flag remains False. If nums has at least 2 elements, the loop checks the absolute difference between consecutive elements. If any absolute difference is greater than or equal to 2, flag is set to False and the loop breaks. If all absolute differences are less than 2, flag remains True after the loop.**
