According to the code, the loop can execute if the length of `nums` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, `n` being a string representing the size of the array does not affect the loop execution. The state needs to be adjusted so that `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.
State: **`n` is a string representing the size of the array, `elements` of the array are positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, `i` is 0**
