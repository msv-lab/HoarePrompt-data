Example Answer:
The variable `flag` is assigned the value `True`. As the initial state does not provide any information about other variables, the output state is simply: `n` is a string representing the size of the array, elements of the array are positive integers, `flag` is True.
Output State: **`n` is a string representing the size of the array, elements of the array are positive integers, `flag` is True**
