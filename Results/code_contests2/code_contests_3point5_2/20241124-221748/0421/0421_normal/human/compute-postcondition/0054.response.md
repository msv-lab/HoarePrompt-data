Output State: **If there are less than 2 elements in the array, the loop does not execute, and the initial values of all variables remain the same. If the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the array is greater than or equal to 2 during the iteration, `flag` will be set to False and the loop will break. After the loop finishes, `nums` list will have the maximum value removed, `i` will be an index in the range of `nums`, and `flag` will remain True if the condition is never met or False if it is met.**
