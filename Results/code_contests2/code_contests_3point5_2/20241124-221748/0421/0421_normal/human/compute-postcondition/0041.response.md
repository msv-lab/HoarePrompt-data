Postcondition: ***`nums` list has at least two elements, `i` is 0, `flag` is False, and the absolute difference between `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` is less than 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
