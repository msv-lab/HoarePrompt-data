According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list with at least two elements, `i` is 1, and `flag` is either False or True. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` is a list with at least two elements, `i` is 2, `flag` is either False or True**
