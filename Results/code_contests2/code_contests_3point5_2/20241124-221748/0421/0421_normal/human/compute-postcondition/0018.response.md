Output State: **If the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the array is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` will be set to False. The loop will break at that point and `i` will be the index at which the condition is met. The program ensures that `flag` accurately reflects whether the condition is met during the iteration. If there are less than 2 elements in the array, the loop does not execute, and the initial values of all variables remain the same.**
