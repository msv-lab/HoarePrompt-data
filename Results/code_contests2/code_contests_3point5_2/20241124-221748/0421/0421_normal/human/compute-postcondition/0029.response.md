According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list, `i` is an index in the range of `nums`, `flag` is False. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be less than the length of `nums` - 2 since the loop iterates until `len(nums) - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` is a list, `i` is an index less than the length of `nums` - 2, `flag` is False**
