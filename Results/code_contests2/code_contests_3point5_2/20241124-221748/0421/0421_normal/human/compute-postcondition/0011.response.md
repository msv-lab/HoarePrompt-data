Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing the size of the array, `elements` of the array are positive integers, `flag` is True or False, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, and `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial values.***
