Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. Since the input function returns a string, `n` will be a string representing the size of the array. The elements of the array are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is a string representing the size of the array, elements of the array are positive integers**
