Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer input `n` and a list of integers. It iterates over the list and checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2. If this condition is met, it sets `flag` to False and stops the iteration. After the loop, it removes the maximum value from the list. Finally, it prints 'YES' if `flag` is True, indicating that the condition was never met, and 'NO' if `flag` is False, indicating that the condition was met at some point. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. **
