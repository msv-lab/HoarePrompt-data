According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is either True or False based on the absolute differences in `nums` after removing the maximum value. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must not be empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **flag is either True or False based on the absolute differences in nums after removing the maximum value**
