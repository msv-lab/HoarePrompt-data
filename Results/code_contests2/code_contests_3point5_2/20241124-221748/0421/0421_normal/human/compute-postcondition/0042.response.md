According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` list has at least two elements, `i` is 0, `flag` is False, and the absolute difference between `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` is less than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` must be less than 2.
State: **`nums` list has at least two elements, `i` is 1, `flag` is False, and the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` is less than 2**
