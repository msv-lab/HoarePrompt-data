Output State: **`nums` is a list, `i` is an index in the range of `nums`, `flag` is False if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2. If the condition is met at any point, `flag` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the condition is never met, `flag` remains True after the loop completes.**
