According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the absolute difference condition is satisfied between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string representing the size of the array, `elements` of the array are positive integers, `flag` is True or False, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, and `i` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, the absolute difference between `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` must not be greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a string representing the size of the array, `elements` of the array are positive integers, `flag` is True or False, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, and `i` is 0**
