According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is within the range of `nums` and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list, `i` is an index in the range of `nums`, and the condition for `flag` is not specified. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to be within the range of `nums` and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` should be less than 2.
State: **`nums` is a list, `i` is an index in the range of `nums`, `flag` is not specified**
