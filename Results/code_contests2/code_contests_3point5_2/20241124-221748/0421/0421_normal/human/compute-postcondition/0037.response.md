According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are at least two elements in the `nums` list. Before the loop starts, the maximum value has been removed from the `nums` list, so the list must have at least two elements. Additionally, `i` is an index in the range of `nums`, so it should be set to 0. The `flag` remains False if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, so to ensure the loop executes, `flag` should be False, and the initial values of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` should have an absolute difference less than 2.
State: **`nums` list has at least two elements, `i` is 0, `flag` is False, `abs(nums[0] - nums[1])` is less than 2**
