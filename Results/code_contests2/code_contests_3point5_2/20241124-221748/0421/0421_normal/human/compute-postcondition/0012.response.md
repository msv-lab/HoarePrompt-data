According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a string representing the size of the array, `elements` of the array are positive integers, `flag` is True or False, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, and `i` is 1**
