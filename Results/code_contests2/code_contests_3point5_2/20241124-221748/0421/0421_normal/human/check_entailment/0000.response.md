Correctness: **False**

The code does not always follow the problem description. The algorithm described in the problem states that if two stacks of ravioli are next to each other and differ in height by two or more, the top ravioli of the taller stack should slide down on top of the lower stack. However, the code does not handle this scenario. The code only checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2, but it does not address the specific case of ravioli stacking on top of each other. Therefore, the code may not always sort the array correctly according to the rules of the algorithm. 

To ensure the correctness of the algorithm, the code should be modified to handle the case where ravioli from a taller stack slides down onto a lower stack when the height difference is two or more.
