Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly implement the described algorithm for all potential cases. One such case is when the input array is [3, 1, 2]. In this case, the algorithm will output "YES" according to the program, but the correct output should be "NO" as the ravioli from the stack of height 3 will slide on the stack of height 1 before the tallest stack is chosen for the first time. This inconsistency shows that the program does not always produce the right sorted array as described in the problem.
