Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3 1 2
```
The program should output "NO" because the ravioli from the stack of height 3 will slide onto the stack of height 1, which violates the sorting rules. However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" in this case. 

Therefore, the program does not work as expected for all potential cases and is incorrect.
