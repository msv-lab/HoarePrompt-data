Example Answer:
`p` is assigned a list comprehension that subtracts 1 from each element in the list obtained by splitting the input. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers. Since the initial state only mentions `n` as an input integer, the output state will be `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each element of the input list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each element of the input list**
