Example Answer:
The value of `col` is assigned to the `i-th` element of the `comps` list. The elements of the `comps` list are adjusted, `col` is updated by 1, and `i` is incremented. Therefore, the Output State is: `comps` list elements adjusted, `col` is updated by 1, `i` is incremented.
Output State: **`comps` list elements adjusted, `col` is updated by 1, `i` is incremented**
