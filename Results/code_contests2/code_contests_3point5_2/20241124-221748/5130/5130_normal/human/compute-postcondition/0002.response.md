Example Answer:
The map function applies the int function to each element obtained by splitting the input. Since the input list is already subtracted by 1 and stored in variable `p`, the output state would be `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each element of the input list, and `b` is a map object containing integers obtained by splitting the input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each element of the input list, and `b` is a map object containing integers obtained by splitting the input**
