Example Answer:
The variable `col` is assigned the value 0. This assignment does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each element of the input list, `b` is a map object containing integers obtained by splitting the input, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each element of the input list, `b` is a map object containing integers obtained by splitting the input, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 0**
