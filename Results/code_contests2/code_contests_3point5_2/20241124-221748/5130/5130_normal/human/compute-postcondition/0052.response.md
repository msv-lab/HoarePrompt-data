Output State: **After the loop executes, `comps` is a list where each element is updated to the corresponding `col` value, `col` is the total number of unique values in the `comps` list, `i` is the last value assigned in the loop. If any element `p[j]` points to an element in `comps` that already has a non-zero value, the loop does not execute, and `comps` remains a list of n zeros.**
