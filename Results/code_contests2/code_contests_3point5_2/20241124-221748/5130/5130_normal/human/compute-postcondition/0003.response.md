Example Answer: 
A list comprehension is used to create a list `comps` of `n` elements, each initialized to 0. The value of `n` is already known as an input integer. Therefore, after executing the code, the `comps` list will be a list of `n` zeros.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each element of the input list, `b` is a map object containing integers obtained by splitting the input, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros**
