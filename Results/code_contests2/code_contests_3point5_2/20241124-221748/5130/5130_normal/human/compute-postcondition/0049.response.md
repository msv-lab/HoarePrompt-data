Output State: **If the initial value of p[i] is such that comps[p[i]] is not equal to 0, then the loop will not execute. Otherwise, the loop will execute at least once, updating the comps list elements, updating col by 1, incrementing i, updating j to the new value of i, assigning j the value at index i in list p, and setting comps[p[j]] to col. The loop will continue until comps[p[j]] is no longer equal to 0.**
