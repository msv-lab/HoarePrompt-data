Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` has been incremented previously. Therefore, after execution, `j` will have the updated value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`comps` list elements adjusted, `col` is updated by 1, `i` is incremented, `j` is equal to the updated value of `i`**
