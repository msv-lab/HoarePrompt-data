Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each element of the input list, `b` is a map object containing integers obtained by splitting the input, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is an integer, `i` is an integer. If comps[i] == 0, then col is increased by 1 and comps[i] is updated to col. If the loop executes, then comps is updated such that comps[i] is assigned the value of col for all i in the range [0, n-1]. If the input list contains elements outside the range [0, n-1] or if p[j] points to an element already assigned a non-zero value in comps, the loop won't execute and comps remains a list of n zeros.***
