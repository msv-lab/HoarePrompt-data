Postcondition: ***`comps` is a list containing elements adjusted to `col` for the current value of `i`. The input list elements are within the range [0, n-1]. For any element `p[j]`, it does not point to an element with a non-zero value in `comps`. If `comps[i]` was 0, then it is updated to `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, and the loop ensures that the elements in `comps` are correctly adjusted based on their relationships with `p`. If `p[j]` points to an element with a non-zero value in `comps` or if `j` is out of bounds, the loop does not execute.***
