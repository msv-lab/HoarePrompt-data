Example Answer: 
`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and the value of `i` is not known in the initial state. After execution, `j` will have the same value as `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `comps[i]` is adjusted to `col` for the current value of `i`, input list elements are within the range [0, n-1], p[j] does not point to an element with a non-zero value in comps, `col` is incremented by 1, and `j` equals `i`.
Output State: **`comps[i]` is adjusted to `col` for the current value of `i`, input list elements are within the range [0, n-1], p[j] does not point to an element with a non-zero value in comps, `col` is incremented by 1, and `j` equals `i`**
