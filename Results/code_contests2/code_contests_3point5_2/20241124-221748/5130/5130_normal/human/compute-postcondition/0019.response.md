Output State: **If the input list is such that for any j, p[j] leads to an element outside the range [0, n-1] or if p[j] points to an element that is already assigned a non-zero value in comps, then the loop won't execute and comps will remain a list of n zeros. If all elements in comps are initially 0 and the loop executes, then comps will be updated such that comps[i] is assigned the value of col for all i in the range [0, n-1].**
