Example Answer:
The value of `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `col` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `comps[i]` and `col` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `comps[i]` is adjusted to `col` for the current value of `i`, input list elements are within the range [0, n-1], p[j] does not point to an element with a non-zero value in comps, and `col` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`comps[i]` is adjusted to `col` for the current value of `i`, input list elements are within the range [0, n-1], p[j] does not point to an element with a non-zero value in comps, and `col` is incremented by 1**
