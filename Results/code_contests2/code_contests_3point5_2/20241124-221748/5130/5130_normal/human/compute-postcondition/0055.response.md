Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `p`, and `b`. It then processes the values to assign unique colors to elements based on the sequence `p`. The function calculates the total number of unique colors and prints either 0 or the total number of colors based on certain conditions. The function does not accept any explicit parameters but works based on the provided preconditions.**
