The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the preconditions provided. The preconditions state that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `p` is a sequence of integers where each element pi satisfies 1 <= pi <= n, and `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with the sequences `p` and `b` based on the preconditions provided, without accepting any explicit parameters.
