Example Answer: 
`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, and `j` is assigned a new value based on `p[j]`. The value of `j` changes based on `p[j]`, and `p[j]` does not point to an element with a non-zero value in `comps`. Therefore, the Output State is: `comps[p[j]]` is adjusted to 0 for the current value of `j`, input list elements are within the range [0, n-1], `p[j]` does not point to an element with a non-zero value in `comps`, `col` is incremented by 1, and `j` is assigned a new value based on `p[j] where `j` takes the value of `p[j]`.
Output State: **`comps[p[j]]` is adjusted to 0 for the current value of `j`, input list elements are within the range [0, n-1], `p[j]` does not point to an element with a non-zero value in `comps`, `col` is incremented by 1, and `j` is assigned a new value based on `p[j] where `j` takes the value of `p[j]`**
