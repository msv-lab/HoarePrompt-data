Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed in the permutation p and sequence b to ensure that every skewer visits each of the 2n placements. The program simply calculates the number of connected components in the permutation graph and adds 1 if the sum of the elements in sequence b is 0.

This approach does not address the actual problem requirements and does not provide the correct output for all potential cases. There is missing logic in the program to determine the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed in permutation p and sequence b.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
