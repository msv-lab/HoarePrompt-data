Example Answer:
`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, but `j` is updated based on the value of `p[j]`. The initial state of `comps[p[j]]` is 0, so after execution, `comps[j]` is assigned `col` and `j` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is updated based on the value of `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is assigned `col`.
Output State: **`comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is updated based on the value of `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is assigned `col`**
