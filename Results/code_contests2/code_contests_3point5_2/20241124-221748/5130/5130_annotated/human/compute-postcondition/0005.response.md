According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, for it to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a sequence of integers representing the permutation of moving the skewers, `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones representing the reversal of skewers, `comps` is a list of zeros with length equal to `n`, `col` is assigned the value 0, `i` is 0**
