According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a sequence of integers representing the permutation of moving the skewers, `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones representing the reversal of skewers, `comps` is a list of integers with length equal to `n`, `col` is the number of colors used, `i` is 0. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a sequence of integers representing the permutation of moving the skewers, `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones representing the reversal of skewers, `comps` is a list of integers with length equal to `n`, `col` is the number of colors used, `i` is 1**
