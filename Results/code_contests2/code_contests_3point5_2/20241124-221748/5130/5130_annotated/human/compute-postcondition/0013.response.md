Output State: **n is a positive integer, p is a sequence of integers representing the permutation of moving the skewers, b is a sequence of zeros and ones representing the reversal of skewers, comps[j] is assigned the value 1, col is assigned the value 1, i is 0, and j is updated based on the permutation sequence `p` such that comps[p[j]] is not 0, and the new value of j is determined by the permutation sequence `p`**
