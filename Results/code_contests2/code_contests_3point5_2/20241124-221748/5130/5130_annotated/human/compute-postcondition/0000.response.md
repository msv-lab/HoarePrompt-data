Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: **n is an integer representing the number of skewers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). p is a sequence of integers representing the permutation of moving the skewers (1 ≤ pi ≤ n). b is a sequence of zeros and ones representing the reversal of skewers.**
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of skewers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). p is a sequence of integers representing the permutation of moving the skewers (1 ≤ pi ≤ n). b is a sequence of zeros and ones representing the reversal of skewers.**
