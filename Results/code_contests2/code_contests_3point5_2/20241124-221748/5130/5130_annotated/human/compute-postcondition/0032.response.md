Example Answer:
The value of `comps[j]` is assigned `col`. The initial state mentions that `comps[p[j]]` is non-zero, so based on the updated value of `j`, `comps[j]` is assigned `col`. Therefore, the Output State is: `comps[p[j]]` is non-zero, `j` is updated based on the value of `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is assigned `col`.
Output State: **`comps[p[j]]` is non-zero, `j` is updated based on the value of `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is assigned `col`**
