Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a sequence of integers representing the permutation of moving the skewers, `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones representing the reversal of skewers, `comps` is a list of integers with length equal to `n`, `col` is the number of colors used, `i` is 0. If the permutation sequence `p` leads to a cycle where comps[p[j]] is 0, then the loop terminates correctly assigning colors to the skewers. If the loop continues indefinitely, it indicates a logical error in the permutation sequence `p`. In both cases, the state of all variables remains consistent with the last valid iteration before termination.***
