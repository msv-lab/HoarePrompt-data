Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, and `comps[p[j]]` is 0. Based on the previous value of `p[j]`, the value of `j` changes accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is updated based on the value of `p[j]`.
Output State: **`comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is updated based on the value of `p[j]`**
