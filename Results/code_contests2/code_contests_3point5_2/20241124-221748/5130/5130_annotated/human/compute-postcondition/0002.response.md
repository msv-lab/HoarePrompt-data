Example Answer:
The sequence b is created by mapping the input integers after splitting by spaces to integers. The initial state variables n, and p remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of skewers, p is a sequence of integers representing the permutation of moving the skewers, b is a sequence of zeros and ones representing the reversal of skewers.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of skewers, p is a sequence of integers representing the permutation of moving the skewers, b is a sequence of zeros and ones representing the reversal of skewers**
