According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `comps[p[j]]` is 0. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `comps[p[j]]` needs to be set to a non-zero value. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`comps[p[j]]` is non-zero, `j` is updated based on the value of `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is assigned `col`**
