According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. If this condition is true, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `comps[j]` is equal to `col`, and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `comps[p[0]]` needs to be equal to 0. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`comps[j]` is equal to `col`, `j` is 0, `comps[p[0]]` is equal to 0**
