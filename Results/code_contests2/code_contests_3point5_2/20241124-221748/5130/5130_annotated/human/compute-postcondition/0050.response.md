Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a sequence of integers representing a permutation, `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones, `comps` is a list of integers with length equal to `n`, `col` is the number of colors used, `i` is updated to 2. If `comps[p[2]]` is not equal to 0, no changes are made. If `comps[p[2]]` is equal to 0, then `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is set to `col`, and `j` is set to 2. The loop updates `j` to the next index determined by the permutation sequence `p`, setting `comps[j]` to `col` until a non-zero value is found in `comps`, updating `j` and `comps[j]` with `col` for the last `j` reached.***
