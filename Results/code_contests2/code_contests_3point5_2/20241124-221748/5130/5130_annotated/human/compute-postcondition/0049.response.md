Output State: **If `comps[p[2]]` is not equal to 0, the loop will not execute. If `comps[p[2]]` is equal to 0, then `comps[j]` is equal to `col`, where `j` is the index determined by the permutation sequence `p`. The loop will continue until a value in `comps` is found that is not 0, updating `j` and assigning `col` to `comps[j]`. After the loop finishes, `comps[j]` is equal to `col` for the last value of `j` reached.**
