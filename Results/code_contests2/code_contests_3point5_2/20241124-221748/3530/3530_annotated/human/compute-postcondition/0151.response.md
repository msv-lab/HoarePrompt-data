Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of the current value with respect to `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, `mask & 1 << (j + 1)` holds true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of its current value with respect to `MOD`, `j` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, `mask & 1 << (j + 1)` holds true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of its current value with respect to `MOD`, `j` is less than `n**`
