Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The value of MOD remains the same. The output state is: MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is the final value after the loop, j is less than n, and dp[i][mask] is updated based on dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j].
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is the final value after the loop, j is less than n, and dp[i][mask] is updated based on dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
