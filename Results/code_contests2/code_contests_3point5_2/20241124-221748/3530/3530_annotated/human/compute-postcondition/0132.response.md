Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is 1, j is 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the jth bit of mask is set, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 << j] modulo MOD. This process covers all possible scenarios and ensures the correctness of the program after the if else block executes.***
