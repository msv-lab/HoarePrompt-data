According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is greater than 0, it does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is the initial value, j is 1**
