Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1. The variable mask is the final value after the loop, j is less than n. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the result modulo MOD. The loop will execute at least once if n is greater than 0. If n is 0, the loop will not execute, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
