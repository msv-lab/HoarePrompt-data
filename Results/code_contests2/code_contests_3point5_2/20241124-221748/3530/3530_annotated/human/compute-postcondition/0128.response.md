Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is 1, j is 0. If the element at index i-1 and j in list a is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation of mask and 1 shifted left by j is true, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking modulo MOD. This postcondition covers all possible edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the if statement executes.***
