Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of the current value with respect to `MOD`. Since the value of `dp[i][mask]` is already calculated and stored, this operation is performed directly on the current value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, `mask & 1 << (j + 1)` holds true, and the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` with modulus operation.
Output State: **`a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, `mask & 1 << (j + 1)` holds true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulus operation**
