According to the code, the loop will always execute as the range starts from 1. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to ensure the loop execution is as follows:
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains a list of integers returned by mapping `int` on the input split by spaces and is not empty, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with all zeros of size n+1 by 2^n, `i` ranges from 1 to 2^n inclusive, `dp[0][i]` is 1**.
