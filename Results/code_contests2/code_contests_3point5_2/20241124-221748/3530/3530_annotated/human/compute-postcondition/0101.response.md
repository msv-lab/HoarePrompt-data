Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n where dp[0][i] is 1, mask is 0, and j is 2. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 left-shifted by j is true, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 left-shifted by j], and finally the value of dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD. This updating process covers all possible scenarios for the variables involved after the execution of the if statement, ensuring the correctness of the program.***
