At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than 0, a is a two-dimensional array, i and j are valid indices within the bounds of the array. The condition a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 left shifted by j yielding true ensures the update of dp[i][mask]. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable j needs to be adjusted to be less than n.
State: **n is greater than 0, a is a two-dimensional array, i and j are valid indices within the bounds of the array, j is less than n**
