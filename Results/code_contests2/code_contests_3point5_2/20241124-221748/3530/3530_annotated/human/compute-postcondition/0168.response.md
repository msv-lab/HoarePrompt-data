Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, a is a two-dimensional array, i and j are valid indices within the bounds of the array. If a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 left shifted by j yields true, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 left shifted by j] and taking the result modulo MOD. This postcondition covers all scenarios where the conditions hold true and ensures the values of variables are updated accordingly.***
