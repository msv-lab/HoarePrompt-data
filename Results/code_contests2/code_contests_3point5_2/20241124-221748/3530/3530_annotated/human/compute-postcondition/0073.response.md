According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is updated from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, j is 0**
