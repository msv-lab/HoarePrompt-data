Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and adding it. Then, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 0, a is a two-dimensional array, i and j are indices within the bounds of the array, the element at position a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, the j-th bit of the mask is set to 1, and dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], and then taking the modulo operation.
