Output State: 
- If n <= 0 or a is an empty list:
  MOD remains 1000000007, n is less than or equal to 0, a is an empty list, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, i ranges from 0 to 2^n-1 inclusive. The loop does not execute, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.

- If n > 0 and a is not an empty list:
  MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, i ranges from 0 to 2^n-1 inclusive. After the loop executes, dp will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code, involving the values of a[i - 1][j], mask, dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], and MOD. The loop will execute for each valid index i, mask, and j in the ranges specified, updating dp[i][mask] accordingly.
