Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is the final value after the loop, j is less than n. If a[i - 1][j] is 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the modulo by MOD. All other variables and conditions remain consistent.***
