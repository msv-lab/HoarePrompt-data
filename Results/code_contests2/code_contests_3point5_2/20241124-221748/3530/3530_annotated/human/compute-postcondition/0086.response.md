According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is updated from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, j is 2**
