Postcondition: ***All variables are in their initial state. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`. The condition `j < n` holds true. If the if statement condition is met, `dp[i][mask]` is further updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios.***
