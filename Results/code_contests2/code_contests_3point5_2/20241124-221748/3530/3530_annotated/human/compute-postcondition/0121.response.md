Output State: 

- If n is less than or equal to 0:
  MOD remains 1000000007, n is less than or equal to 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is updated from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, j is 0.

- If n is greater than 0:
  MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is updated from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, j is n. 
  After the loop finishes, dp will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code, involving the values of a[i - 1][j], mask, dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], and MOD.
