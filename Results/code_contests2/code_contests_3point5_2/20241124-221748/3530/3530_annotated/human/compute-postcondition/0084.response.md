Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is updated from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, j is 1, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], dp[i][mask] is then taken modulo MOD.**
