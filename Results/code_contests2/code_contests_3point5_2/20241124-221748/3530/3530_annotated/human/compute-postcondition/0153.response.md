According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j < n`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are in their initial state. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j`. Since `j` is an iterator variable, it needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
State: **All variables are in their initial state, `j` is incremented by 1**
