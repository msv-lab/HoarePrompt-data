Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is the initial value, j is 0. The element at index i-1, j in list a is 1 and the j-th bit in mask is set, dp[i][mask] is incremented by the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
