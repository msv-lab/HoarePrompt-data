Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is updated from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, j is 0. If a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and the jth bit of mask is set, dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taken modulo MOD. All other elements in dp remain unchanged.***
