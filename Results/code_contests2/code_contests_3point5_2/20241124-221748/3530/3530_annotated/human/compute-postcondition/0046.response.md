Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is the initial value, j is 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask has the j-th bit set, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the result modulo MOD. All variables retain their initial conditions, and the if statement correctly handles the cases where a[i - 1][j] is 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set, ensuring the proper update of dp[i][mask] while maintaining the integrity of the program state.***
