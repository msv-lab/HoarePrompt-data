According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the mask is within the range of 1 to 1 << n. At the end of the last iteration, the mask is at a certain value within that range. To execute one more time, the mask needs to be adjusted to the next value within that range. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **No adjustments needed**
