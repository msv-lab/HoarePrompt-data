Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n where dp[0][i] is 1, mask is 1, j is 1, dp[j][0] is 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the result modulo MOD. This process covers all possible edge cases of the program, ensuring the integrity of the calculations and variable relationships.***
