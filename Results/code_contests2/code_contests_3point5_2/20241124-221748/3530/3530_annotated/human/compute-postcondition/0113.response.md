Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] set to 1, mask is 1 less than the value of the last iteration incremented by 1, j is 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated to dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taken modulo MOD. This process covers all potential edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the if statement executes.***
