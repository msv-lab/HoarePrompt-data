Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] set to 1, mask is 1 less than the value of the last iteration incremented by 1, j is 2. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask bitwise AND operation with 1 shifted left by j is true, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 shifted left by j], and dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulo of dp[i][mask] by MOD. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program after the if else block executes.***
