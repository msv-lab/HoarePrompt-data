Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007. The integer n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1. The variable mask is the final value after the loop, and j is less than n. If a[i - 1][j] is 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the modulo by MOD. At the start of the next iteration, no states need to be adjusted as the loop can execute again with the same conditions. The postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the overall state of the program after the if else block executes.***
