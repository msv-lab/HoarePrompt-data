According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 to satisfy the condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains a list of integers returned by mapping `int` on the input split by spaces and is not empty, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with all zeros of size n+1 by 2^n, `i` is 3, `dp[0][i]` is 1**
