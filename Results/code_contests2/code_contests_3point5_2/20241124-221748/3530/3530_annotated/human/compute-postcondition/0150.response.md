Example Answer: 
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`. The value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is unknown, and the value of `mask` and `j` is also unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, `mask & 1 << (j + 1)` holds true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`, `j` is less than `n.
Output State: **`a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, `mask & 1 << (j + 1)` holds true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`, `j` is less than `n**.
