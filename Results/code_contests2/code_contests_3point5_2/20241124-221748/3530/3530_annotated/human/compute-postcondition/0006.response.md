Example Answer:
The `map(int, raw_input().split())` part converts the input values split by spaces into integers and returns a list. The `append` method then appends this list to the existing list `a`. The variable `MOD` with a value of 1000000007, `n` greater than 0, and the list `a` containing integers are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains a list of integers returned by mapping `int` on the input split by spaces**
