Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is 1, j is 2. If the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is satisfied, then dp[i][mask] is updated to dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD. The overall state of the program variables after the execution of the if statement covers all edge cases ensuring the necessary conditions are met for proper computation and update of dp[i][mask].***
