Since the loop starts from 1, the loop will execute if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is updated from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, j is less than n**
