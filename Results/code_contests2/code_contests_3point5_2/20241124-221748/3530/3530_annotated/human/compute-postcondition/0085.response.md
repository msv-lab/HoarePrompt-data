Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is updated from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, j is 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking modulo MOD. This operation covers all possible edge cases and correctly updates the dynamic programming table dp.***
