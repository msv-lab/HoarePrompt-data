According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` contains a list of integers returned by mapping `int` on the input split by spaces. To execute the loop one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains a list of integers returned by mapping `int` on the input split by spaces.**
