Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n where dp[0][i] is 1, mask is 1, j is 0, dp[j][0] is 1. The element at index i-1 in list a has a value of 1 and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 shifted left by j is true for the value of j. dp[i][mask] is updated to be dp[i][mask] + dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. dp[i][mask] is then taken modulo MOD.**
