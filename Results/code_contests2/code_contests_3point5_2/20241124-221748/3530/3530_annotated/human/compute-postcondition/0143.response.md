Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are unknown, so the exact result after taking the modulo cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is met, dp[i][mask] is updated, n is greater than 0, j is from 0 to n-1, and dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j].
Output State: **a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is met, dp[i][mask] is updated, n is greater than 0, j is from 0 to n-1, and dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
