According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j is less than n. Since j is n-2, it needs to be adjusted to be less than n. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state should be modified as follows:
State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is the final value after the loop, j is less than n**
