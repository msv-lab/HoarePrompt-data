Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by taking its modulo with MOD. The values of n, a, i, and j are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 0, a is a two-dimensional array, i and j are valid indices within the bounds of the array.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, a is a two-dimensional array, i and j are valid indices within the bounds of the array**
