Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, a is a two-dimensional array, i and j are valid indices within the bounds of the array. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of the mask is set to 1, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the modulo operation. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment.***
