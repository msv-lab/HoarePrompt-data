Postcondition: ***`a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, `mask & 1 << (j + 1)` holds true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << (j + 1)]` and then taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is also equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is further updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`. All variables, including `n` and `j`, remain within their defined ranges.***
