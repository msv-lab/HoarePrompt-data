Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0. a is a two-dimensional array. i and j are valid indices within the bounds of the array. If a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and the binary AND operation of mask and 1 shifted left by j is true, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 shifted left by j] and taking the result modulo MOD. This condition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases for the given program fragment.***
