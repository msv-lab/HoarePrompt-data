Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i - 1][mask]`, and `j` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 0, a is a two-dimensional array, i and j are valid indices within the bounds of the array.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, a is a two-dimensional array, i and j are valid indices within the bounds of the array**
