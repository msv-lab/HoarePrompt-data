According to the code, the loop executes as long as the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is met for all iterations. At the end of the previous iteration, MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is the final value after the loop, j is n-1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- n remains greater than 0
- j is set to n-2 to indicate the next iteration
- The condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j needs to be met
- dp[i][mask] values need to be updated based on the calculation dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] % MOD

State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is the final value after the loop, j is n-2**
