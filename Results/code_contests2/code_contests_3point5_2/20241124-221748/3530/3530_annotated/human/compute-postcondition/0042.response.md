Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is the initial value, j is 0. If a[i - 1][j] is 1 and the j-th bit in mask is set, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking modulo MOD. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases after the execution of the if statement.***
