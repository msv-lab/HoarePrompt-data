Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n where dp[0][i] is 1, mask is 1, j ranges from 0 to n-1. If a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 shifted left by j is true, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 shifted left by j] and taking modulo by MOD. The loop will not execute if n is 0 or a is an empty list, in which case dp remains all zeros and i ranges from 1 to 2^n without any updates.**
