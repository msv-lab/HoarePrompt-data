According to the code, the loop will execute if n is greater than 0. The loop will iterate for all values of j from 0 to n-1. Before the loop starts, the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j needs to be met for the loop to execute. Therefore, the initial state needs to ensure that these conditions are met. Additionally, since the loop will iterate for all values of j from 0 to n-1, the value of j needs to be set accordingly.

State: **a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is met, dp[i][mask] is updated, n is greater than 0, j is from 0 to n-1**
