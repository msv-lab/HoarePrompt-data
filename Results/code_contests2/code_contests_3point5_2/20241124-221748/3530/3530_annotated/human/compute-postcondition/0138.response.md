Output State: **If the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is met, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD. The loop will execute for all values of j from 0 to n-1. If n is 0, the loop will not execute and the values of the variables will remain the same as the initial state.**
