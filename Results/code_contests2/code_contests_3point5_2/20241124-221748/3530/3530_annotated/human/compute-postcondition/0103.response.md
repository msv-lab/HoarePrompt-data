Output State: **If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j evaluates to true, then dp[i][mask] will be updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 << j] and taking the modulo operation. This process will be repeated for each value of j in the range of n. The loop will not execute if n is 0 or a[i - 1][j] is 0. After the loop execution, MOD will remain 1000000007, n will be greater than 0, a will contain a list of integers, dp will be a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] set to 1, mask will be 1 less than the value of the last iteration, and j will be n+1.**
