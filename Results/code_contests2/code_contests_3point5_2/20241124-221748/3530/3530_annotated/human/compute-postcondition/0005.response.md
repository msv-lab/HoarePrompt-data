According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains a list of integers returned by mapping `int` on the input split by spaces. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **Output State: MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains a list of integers returned by mapping `int` on the input split by spaces**
