Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains a list of integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0. The element at index i-1 and j in list a is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND operation of mask and 1 shifted left by j is true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the formula**
