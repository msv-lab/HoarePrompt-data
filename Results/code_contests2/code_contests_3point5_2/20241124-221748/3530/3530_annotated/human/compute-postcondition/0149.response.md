According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, `mask & 1 << (j + 1)` holds true, and the necessary updates have been made to `dp[i][mask]`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is also equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then additional updates have been made to `dp[i][mask]`. Since all variables remain within their defined ranges, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute one more time is `j`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, `mask & 1 << (j + 1)` holds true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << (j + 1)]` and then taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`, `j` is less than `n**`
