Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n where dp[0][i] is 1, mask is 1, j is 2, dp[j][0] is 1. If a[i - 1][j] equals to 1 and mask bitwise AND 1 shifted left by j is true, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 shifted left by j] and taking modulo by MOD. This operation applies to all valid indices i and mask values, ensuring the correctness of the dynamic programming update.***
