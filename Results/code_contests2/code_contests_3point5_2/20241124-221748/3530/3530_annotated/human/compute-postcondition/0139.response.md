According to the code, the loop will execute for all values of `mask` from 1 to 2^n-1. At the end of the last iteration, the loop had executed for a specific `mask` value. To execute the loop one more time, the `mask` value needs to be adjusted to the next value. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the `mask` value.
State: **If the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is met, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD. The loop will execute for all values of j from 0 to n-1. If n is 0, the loop will not execute and the values of the variables will remain the same as the initial state. For the next iteration, the value of mask needs to be incremented to the next value.**
