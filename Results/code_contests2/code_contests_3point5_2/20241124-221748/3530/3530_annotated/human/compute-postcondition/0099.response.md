Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` are known. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n where dp[0][i] is 1, mask is 0, and j is 2.
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n where dp[0][i] is 1, mask is 0, and j is 2**
