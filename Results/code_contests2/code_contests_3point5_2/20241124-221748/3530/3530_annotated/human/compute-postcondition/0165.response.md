According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is greater than 0, a is a two-dimensional array, i and j are valid indices within the bounds of the array**
