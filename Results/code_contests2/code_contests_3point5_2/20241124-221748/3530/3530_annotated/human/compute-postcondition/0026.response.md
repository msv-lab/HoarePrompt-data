Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n where dp[0][i] is 1, mask is 1, j is 0, dp[j][0] is 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 shifted left by j is true, then dp[i][mask] is updated to be dp[i][mask] plus dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD. The overall state of the program after the execution of the if statement covers all edge cases where the conditions are met and the respective calculations and modifications are made to dp[i][mask].***
