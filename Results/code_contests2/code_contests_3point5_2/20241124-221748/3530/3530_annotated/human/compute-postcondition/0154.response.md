Output State: **If n is 0, the loop does not execute and the values of all variables remain the same as the initial state. If n is greater than 0, then the loop will execute for all values of j from 0 to n-1. If the conditions a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j are met, dp[i][mask] will be updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD. The values of n and j will remain within their defined ranges.**
