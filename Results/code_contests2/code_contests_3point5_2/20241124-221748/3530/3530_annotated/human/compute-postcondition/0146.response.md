Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`. The values of `n` and `j` remain within their defined ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: `a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, `mask & 1 << (j + 1)` holds true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << (j + 1)]` and then taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`.
Output State: **`a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, `mask & 1 << (j + 1)` holds true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << (j + 1)]` and then taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`**
