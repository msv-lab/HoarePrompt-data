Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is the initial value, j is 1. If a[i - 1][j] is 1 and mask has the jth bit set, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the result modulo MOD. The state of the program variables after the execution of the if statement is reflected in the updated values of dp[i][mask] based on the conditions met.***
