Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] set to 1, mask is 1 less than the value of the last iteration incremented by 1, j is 1, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], dp[i][mask] is then taken modulo MOD.**
