According to the code, the loop will execute for all values of `mask` from 1 to 1 << n. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed for all values of `mask` up to 1 << n. To execute one more time, the next value of `mask` needs to be considered. Therefore, the next value of `mask` after the last iteration would be 1 << n. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **No adjustment needed**
