Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers returned by mapping int on the input split by spaces and is not empty, dp is a 2D list initialized with all zeros of size n+1 by 2^n, i ranges from 1 to 2^n inclusive, dp[0][i] is 1, mask is 1, j is 0, dp[j][0] is 1. The element at index i-1 in list a has a value of 1 and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 shifted left by j is true for the value of j***
