Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n where dp[0][i] is 1, mask is 0, and j is 0. If a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the modulo operation. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program execution.***
