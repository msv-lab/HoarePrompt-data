Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and applying the modulo operation with MOD. The output state after running this code is: MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is 0, j is 0, and dp[i][mask] is updated with the modulo operation.
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is 0, j is 0, and dp[i][mask] is updated with the modulo operation.**
