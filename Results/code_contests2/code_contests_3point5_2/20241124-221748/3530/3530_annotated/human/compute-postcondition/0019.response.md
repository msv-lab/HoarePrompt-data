Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains a list of integers returned by mapping `int` on the input split by spaces and is not empty, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with all zeros of size n+1 by 2^n, `i` ranges from 0 to 2^n-1 inclusive, `dp[0][i]` is 1. The loop will always execute since the range starts from 0.**
