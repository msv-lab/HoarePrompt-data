Example Answer:
The value at dp[i][mask] is incremented by the value at dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The previous values of dp, i, mask, and j are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 0, a is a two-dimensional array, i and j are valid indices within the bounds of the array.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, a is a two-dimensional array, i and j are valid indices within the bounds of the array**
