Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of integers, dp is a 2D list of size n+1 by 2^n with dp[0][i] as 1, mask is 0, j is 0. The element at index i-1 and j in list a is equal to 1 and the jth bit in the mask is set. dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
