The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input, followed by `n` lines of integers representing compatibility values. It then performs calculations on the compatibility values to update a 2D list `dp` based on specific conditions. Finally, it prints the value at a specific index in `dp`. The function does not return any value. The annotations mention handling cases where `n` is 0 or negative, but the code does not explicitly address these cases.
