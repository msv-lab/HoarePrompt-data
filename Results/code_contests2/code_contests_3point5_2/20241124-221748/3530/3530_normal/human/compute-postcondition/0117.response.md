Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `dp` array values are updated based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`. After the execution of the if statement, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD` if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`. This covers all possible scenarios where `n` is positive and the `dp` array is updated accordingly.***
