Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not explicitly given, so based on the provided initial state, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated**
