Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`. The value of `MOD` is not given, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `dp[i][mask]`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `mask` is adjusted, `n` is adjusted, `a`, `dp`, and `i` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`mask` is adjusted, `n` is adjusted, `a`, `dp`, and `i` remain unchanged**
