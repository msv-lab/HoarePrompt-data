According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `dp` array is updated based on conditions involving matrices `a`, `j` is less than `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. Since `j` is less than `n`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`. It should be incremented by 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `dp` array is updated based on conditions involving matrices `a`, `j` is less than `n + 1**.
