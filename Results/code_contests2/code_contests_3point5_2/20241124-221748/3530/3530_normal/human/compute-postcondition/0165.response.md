According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the variables `mask`, `n`, `a`, `dp`, and `i` remain unchanged. To execute the loop one more time, there must exist at least one value of `j` in the range of `n` where `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true for at least one value of `j` in the range of `n`.

State: **No changes in the program state**
