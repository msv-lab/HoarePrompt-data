Postcondition: ***The program updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo operation with `MOD` if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, where the value of `j` is less than `n+1`. If the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` is met, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then the result is taken modulo `MOD`. This operation covers all possible scenarios when evaluating `dp[i][mask]` based on the given conditions and ensures the correct updating of the variable.***
