Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `n`, and `mask` are given as 0, greater than 0, and increased by 1 respectively. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation**
