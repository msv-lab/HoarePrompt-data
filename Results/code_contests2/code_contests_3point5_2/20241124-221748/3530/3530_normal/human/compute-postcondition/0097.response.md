Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` bitwise AND operation with 1 shifted left by `j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 shifted left by j]` and taking the result modulo MOD. This postcondition covers all cases where the if statement is executed, ensuring the proper update of `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions mentioned.***
