Output State: 
After the loop executes, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0. The `dp` array is updated based on specified conditions involving matrices `a` and `mask`, with the update formula applied to all valid scenarios. If the conditions are not met, the loop does not execute, and `i` and `n` remain unchanged. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the variables retain their initial values.
