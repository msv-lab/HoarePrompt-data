Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` with `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, element at position (i-1, j) in matrix `a` is 1, j-th bit in variable `mask` is set, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated and modulo by `MOD`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, element at position (i-1, j) in matrix `a` is 1, j-th bit in variable `mask` is set, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated and modulo by `MOD`**
