Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` where `j` satisfies the conditions mentioned. The values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are dependent on the previous state of the variables and need to be calculated accordingly. 
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculations involving `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
