Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` with `MOD`. The previous state of the variables `i`, `n`, `mask`, `dp`, `a`, and `j` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` falls within the range of (1, 1 << n), `dp` array is updated based on conditions involving matrices `a`, `j` is less than `n`, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` falls within the range of (1, 1 << n), `dp` array is updated based on conditions involving matrices `a`, `j` is less than `n`, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`**
