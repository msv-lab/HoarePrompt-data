Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is recalculated by taking the modulus MOD of its current value. Since no initial values are provided for i, mask, or MOD, the output state will simply indicate that the operation of taking the modulus has been performed.
Output State: **No changes in the program state, dp[i][mask] has been recalculated with modulus MOD**
