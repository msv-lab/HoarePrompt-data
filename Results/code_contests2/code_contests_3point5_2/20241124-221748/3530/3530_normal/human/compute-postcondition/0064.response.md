Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variables `i`, `mask`, `j` are used in the calculation. Since the actual values of `dp` and `i` are unknown, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `mask` is updated to the next value within the range of (1, 1 << n), `a` is a matrix.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `mask` is updated to the next value within the range of (1, 1 << n), `a` is a matrix**
