Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `mask` is updated to the next value within the range of (1, 1 << n), `a` is a matrix. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo MOD. This condition covers all possible scenarios and updates the state of the program accordingly.***
