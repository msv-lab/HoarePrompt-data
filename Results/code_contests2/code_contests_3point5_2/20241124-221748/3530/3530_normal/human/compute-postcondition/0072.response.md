According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, Output State: i is incremented by 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **Output State: i is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
