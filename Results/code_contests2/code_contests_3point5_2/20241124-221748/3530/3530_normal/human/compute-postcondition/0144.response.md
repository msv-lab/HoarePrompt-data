Postcondition: ***The program updates `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions that `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true. The update includes adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to `dp[i][mask]` and taking the modulo operation with an unspecified variable `MOD`. The postcondition covers the scenario where the if condition is met, and the else part is not present. Edge cases or boundary values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `mask`, and other involved variables are not explicitly specified in the postcondition due to the lack of detailed initial values.***
