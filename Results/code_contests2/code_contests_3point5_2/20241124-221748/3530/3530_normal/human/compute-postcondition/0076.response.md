Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the remainder of dividing its current value by MOD. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are not provided, so the output state is: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, element at position (i-1, j) in matrix a is 1, j-th bit in the mask is set, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the remainder of dividing its current value by MOD.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, element at position (i-1, j) in matrix a is 1, j-th bit in the mask is set, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the remainder of dividing its current value by MOD**
