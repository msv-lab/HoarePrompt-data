Postcondition: ***`i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. If the element at position (i-1, j) in matrix `a` is 1 and the j-th bit in the mask is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the remainder of the result divided by MOD. This covers all possible scenarios of the if statement and its associated else part.***
