Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. The specific values of `i`, `n`, and `j` are not given, so the output state is: `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0**
