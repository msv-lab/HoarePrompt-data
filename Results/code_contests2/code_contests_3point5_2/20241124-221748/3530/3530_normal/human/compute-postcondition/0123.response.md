According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n). So, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `mask` falls within the specified range. Additionally, after the loop executes, `i` is incremented by 1, and the `dp` array is updated based on the conditions involving matrices `a` and `mask`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `dp` array is updated based on conditions involving matrices `a` and `mask`**
