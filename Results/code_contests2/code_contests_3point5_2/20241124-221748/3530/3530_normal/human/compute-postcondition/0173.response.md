According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0. So, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` should remain greater than 0.
State: **Output State: After the loop executes, `i` is incremented by 2, `n` is greater than 0**
