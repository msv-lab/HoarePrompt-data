According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. The loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to 1 to satisfy the condition for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
