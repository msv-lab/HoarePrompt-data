Postcondition: ***The program updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo operation with `MOD` if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true. The value of `j` is less than `n`. The overall state of the program after the execution of the if block ensures that `dp[i][mask]` is correctly updated based on the specified conditions, handling all edge cases where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is satisfied.***
