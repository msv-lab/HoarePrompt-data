Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of the current value. The previous values of `i`, `n`, `mask`, and the matrix `a` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 1, the value at position (i-1, j) in matrix a is 1, and the j-th bit of mask is set to 1. `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulo of the result.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 1, the value at position (i-1, j) in matrix a is 1, the j-th bit of mask is set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo MOD**
