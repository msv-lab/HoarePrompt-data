According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is less than `n`, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0. Since `_` is less than `n`, it needs to be adjusted to `_` is less than `n+1` for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the result of mapping integers from the input split, `_` is less than `n+1`**
