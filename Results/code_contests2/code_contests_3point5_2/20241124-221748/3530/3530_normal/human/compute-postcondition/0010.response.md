Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the result of mapping integers from the input split, `_` is less than `n`. The loop appends `n` lists of mapped integers to list `a`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `a` remains an empty list.**
