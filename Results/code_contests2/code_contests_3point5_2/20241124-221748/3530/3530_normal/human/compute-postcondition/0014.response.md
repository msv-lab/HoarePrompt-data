According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the result of mapping integers from the input split, `_` is less than `n`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) rows and (1 << n) columns filled with zeros, `i` is 1, `dp[0][i]` is 1**
