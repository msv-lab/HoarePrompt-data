According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` in the range of `n`, `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, and `mask & 1 << j`. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is adjusted such that there exists at least one value of `j` in the range of `n` where `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to find a new value for `mask` that satisfies the condition mentioned above. This means we need to find a new value of `mask` that ensures there exists at least one value of `j` in the range of `n` where `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`mask` is adjusted such that there exists at least one value of `j` in the range of `n` where `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true.**
