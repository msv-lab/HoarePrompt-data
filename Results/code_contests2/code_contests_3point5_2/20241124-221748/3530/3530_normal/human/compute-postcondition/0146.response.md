Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` need to be satisfied for this update. The value of `j` ranges from 0 to n-1. The modulo operation with the variable `MOD` is not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: The program updates `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions mentioned.
Output State: **The program updates `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions that `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true. The update includes adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to `dp[i][mask]`.**
