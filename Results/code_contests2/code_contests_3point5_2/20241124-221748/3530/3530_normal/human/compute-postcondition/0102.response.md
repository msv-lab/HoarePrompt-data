According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `mask` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. Since `j` is the iterator of the loop, it needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 1, `j` is less than `n`**
