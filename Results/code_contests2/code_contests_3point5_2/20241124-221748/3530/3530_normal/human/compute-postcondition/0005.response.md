According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to `n`, so in order for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be adjusted to `_` is less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the result of mapping integers from the input split, `_` is less than `n`**
