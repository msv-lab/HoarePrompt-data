According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is less than or equal to 0. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The loop will not execute as `n` is less than or equal to 0**
