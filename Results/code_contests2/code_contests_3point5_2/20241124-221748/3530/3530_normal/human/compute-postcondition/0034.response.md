Postcondition: ***All elements in the first row of the 2D list `dp` have been updated according to the new condition specified. The value of `n` remains greater than 1, `mask` remains as 1, and `j` is still 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`.***
