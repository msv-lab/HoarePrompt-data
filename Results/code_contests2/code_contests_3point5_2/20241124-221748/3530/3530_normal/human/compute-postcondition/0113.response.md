Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, the `dp` array values are updated based on the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`. If the condition is satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. The overall state of the program after the execution of the if statement covers all edge cases where `n` is positive, `j` is 1, and the `dp` array is updated according to the specified conditions.***
