According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an input value, and `a` is an empty list. To ensure the loop executes, `n` needs to be greater than 0. 
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an empty list**
