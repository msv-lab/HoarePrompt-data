Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 1. If the value at position (i-1, j) in matrix `a` is 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo `MOD`. This covers all possible conditions and edge cases for the execution of the if statement.***
