According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `mask` is within the range of 1 to 2^n - 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the `mask` value should be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 1**
