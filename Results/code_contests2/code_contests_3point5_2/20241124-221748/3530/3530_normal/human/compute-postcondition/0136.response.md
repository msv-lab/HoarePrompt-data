Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `dp` array is updated based on conditions involving matrices `a`, `j` is less than `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`.***
