According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `mask` is updated to the next value within the range of (1, 1 << n), `a` is a matrix. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `mask` is updated to the next value within the range of (1, 1 << n), `a` is a matrix**
