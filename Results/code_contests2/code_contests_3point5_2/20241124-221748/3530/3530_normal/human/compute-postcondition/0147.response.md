Example Answer:
The program updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. This ensures that the value of `dp[i][mask]` remains within the range defined by `MOD`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: The program updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`.
Output State: **The program updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`**
