Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`, where `MOD` is a constant value. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 1, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`**
