Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The initial state indicates that all elements in the first row of the 2D list `dp` are set to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1. The calculation of `dp[i][mask]` involves the previous values of `dp` elements and bitwise operations on `mask` and `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the first row of the 2D list `dp` have been updated accordingly, `n` is still greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1.
Output State: **All elements in the first row of the 2D list `dp` have been updated accordingly, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1**
