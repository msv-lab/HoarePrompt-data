Postcondition: ***`mask` is adjusted such that there exists at least one value of `j` in the range of `n` where `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulus with MOD.***
