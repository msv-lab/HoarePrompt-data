Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and adding it to `dp[i][mask]`. Then, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. The variables `dp`, `n`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i-1][j]`, and `MOD` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: all elements in the first row of the 2D list `dp` are set to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, `a[i-1][j]` is equal to 1, the j-th bit of `mask` is set, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulo operation.
