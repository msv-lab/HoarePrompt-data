Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` falls within the range of (1, 1 << n), `dp` array is updated based on conditions involving matrices `a`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is augmented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo MOD. The update occurs for all valid values of `i`, `n`, `mask`, and `j`, ensuring the integrity of the `dp` array based on the specified conditions. After the if statement executes, the program maintains the initial values of `i`, `n`, `mask`, and `dp`, while ensuring that `j` is incremented by 1 in the process.***
