According to the code, the loop can execute again if the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true for some value of `j` in the range of `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `dp[i][mask]` was updated based on these conditions. If we want the loop to execute one more time, we need to find a value of `j` that satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `mask` to ensure that there is at least one `j` value that satisfies the conditions.
State: **The loop will execute if there exists at least one value of `j` in the range of `n` such that `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true. Adjust `mask` accordingly to meet these conditions.**
