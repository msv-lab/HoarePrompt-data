According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is less than `1 << n`, the loop will execute again. 
Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the result of mapping integers from the input split, `_` is less than `n`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) rows and (1 << n) columns filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `dp[0][i]` is 1**
