According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `dp[i][mask]` has been updated, and the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` was satisfied. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `n`. 
State: **After the if block executes, the variable `dp[i][mask]` has been updated, `j` is less than `n**.
