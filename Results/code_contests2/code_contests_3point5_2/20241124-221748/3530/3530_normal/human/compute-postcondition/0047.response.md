According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j`. If this condition is satisfied, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` needs to be satisfied with `j` being greater than 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2**
