Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND operation with 1 shifted left by `j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulus operation by `MOD`. This process handles all cases where the conditions are met and updates `dp[i][mask]` accordingly.***
