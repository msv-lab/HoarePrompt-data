Output State: **If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. If the loop executes, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` ranges from 0 to n-1. The loop updates `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions specified in the if statement, adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it and taking the modulus with MOD.**
