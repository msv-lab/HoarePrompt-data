According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is 1. Since `n` being greater than 0 does not ensure the loop will execute again, it needs to be adjusted to `n` greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All elements in the first row of the 2D list `dp` have been updated according to the condition specified. The value of `n` remains greater than 1, `mask` remains as 1, and `j` is still 1.**
