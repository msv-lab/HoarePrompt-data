According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `mask` is updated to the next value within the range of (1, 1 << n), and `a` is a matrix. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `mask` is updated to the next value within the range of (1, 1 << n), `a` is a matrix**
