According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `mask` should be updated to the next value within the range of (1, 1 << n). Additionally, `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, so `j` should be set to 0 before the loop starts.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `mask` is updated to the next value within the range of (1, 1 << n)**.
