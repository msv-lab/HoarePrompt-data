Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, j is 0. If the value of a at index i-1 and j is 1, and the j-th bit of mask is also 1, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD. This postcondition covers all scenarios where the if statement is executed, ensuring the correct manipulation of variables and the adherence to the given conditions.***
