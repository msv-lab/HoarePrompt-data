Output State: **The loop updates `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions that `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true. If these conditions are met, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then the result is taken modulo `MOD`. The loop executes for each value of `j` in the range of `n`, ensuring the correct updating of `dp[i][mask]`. If the conditions are not satisfied, the loop does not execute, and the values of the variables remain unchanged.**
