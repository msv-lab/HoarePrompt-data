Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is reduced modulo MOD. The previous values of the variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 0, j is 0, the value of a at index i-1 and j is 1, the j-th bit of mask is 1, and dp[i][mask] is incremented by the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, j is 0, the value of a at index i-1 and j is 1, the j-th bit of mask is 1, and dp[i][mask] is incremented by the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD**
