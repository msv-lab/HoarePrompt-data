According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. The condition `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set is crucial for updating `dp[i][mask]`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next iteration should consider different values for `j` that satisfy the condition mentioned above. Therefore, the state to be adjusted for the next iteration is: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0.*

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0**
