According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `n`**
