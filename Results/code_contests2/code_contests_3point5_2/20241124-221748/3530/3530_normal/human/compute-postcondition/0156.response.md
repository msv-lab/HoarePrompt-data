According to the code, the loop can execute if there exists at least one value of `j` in the range of `n` such that `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true. Therefore, before the loop starts, `mask` needs to be adjusted so that it satisfies these conditions. 

State: **`mask` is adjusted so that there exists at least one value of `j` in the range of `n` such that `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true**
