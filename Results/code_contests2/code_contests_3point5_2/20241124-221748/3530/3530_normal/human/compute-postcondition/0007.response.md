According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is less than `n`, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the result of mapping integers from the input split. Since `_` is less than `n`, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the result of mapping integers from the input split, `_` is less than `n`**
