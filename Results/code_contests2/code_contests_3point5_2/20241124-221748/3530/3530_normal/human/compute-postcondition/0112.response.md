Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the `dp` array values are updated accordingly by taking the modulo with `MOD`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the `dp` array values are updated accordingly by taking the modulo with `MOD`**
