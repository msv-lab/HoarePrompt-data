According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is incremented by 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is now 0. Also, the `mask` being increased by 1 doesn't affect the loop execution, so it remains as is.
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 1**
