Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `i` will be 0, `n` will be greater than 0, and `mask` will be increased by 1. The if statement within the loop checks if the value at position (i-1, j) in matrix `a` is 1 and if the j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1. If both conditions are met, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. This postcondition covers all scenarios where the if statement is executed. If the loop does not execute, the variables will retain their initial values.**
