Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `mask` is updated to the next value within the range of (1, 1 << n), `a` is a matrix. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and then modulus by MOD is applied. This operation covers all cases where the conditions are met, ensuring proper calculation and updating of `dp` values based on `mask` and the matrix `a`, while retaining the initial values of `n`, `j`, and `a`.***
