Example Answer:
The values in the `dp` array are updated based on the conditions mentioned. The `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD` to ensure the result remains within a certain range. The previous values of the `dp` array elements are not specified, so the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and the `dp` array values are updated based on the conditions mentioned and taken modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and the `dp` array values are updated based on the conditions mentioned and taken modulo `MOD`**
