Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus with `MOD`. The previous values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulus operation.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulus operation**
