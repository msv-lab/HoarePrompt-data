According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, the `dp` array values are updated based on the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, covering all edge cases where `n` is positive, and the `dp` array is updated according to the specified conditions**
