According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `mask` is increased by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 1**
