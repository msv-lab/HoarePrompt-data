According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `mask` is within the range `1` to `1 << n`. So, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `mask` needs to be set to `1` and `n` must be greater than `0`.
State: **all elements in the first row of the 2D list dp are set to 1, n is greater than 0, mask is 1**
