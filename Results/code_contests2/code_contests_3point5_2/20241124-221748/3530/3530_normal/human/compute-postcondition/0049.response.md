Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated according to the modulo operation.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated according to the modulo operation**
