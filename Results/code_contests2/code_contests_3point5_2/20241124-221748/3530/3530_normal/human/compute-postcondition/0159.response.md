Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus with MOD. The calculation involves `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are not provided, so the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus with MOD.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus with MOD**
