Postcondition: ***After the if block executes, the variable `dp[i][mask]` has been updated to its previous value plus the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` with the operation of modulus MOD applied. This update occurs if the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` is satisfied. The postcondition encapsulates all possible scenarios and edge cases where the variables remain consistent with the initial precondition.***
