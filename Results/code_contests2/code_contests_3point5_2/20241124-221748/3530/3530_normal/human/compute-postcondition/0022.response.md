According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is greater than 0. However, the elements in the first row of the 2D list dp being set to 1 and mask being 1 do not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to set j to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **all elements in the first row of the 2D list dp are set to 1, n is greater than 0, mask is 1, j is 0**
