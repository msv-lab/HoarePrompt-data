According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `mask` in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `mask` is increased by 2. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the `mask` value needs to be incremented by 1 and the `i` value needs to be updated to 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 3**
