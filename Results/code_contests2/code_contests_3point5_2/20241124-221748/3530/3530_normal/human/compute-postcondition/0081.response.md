Postcondition: ***`i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo MOD. This update is reflected in the overall state of the program after the if statement executes, considering all possible combinations of `a[i - 1][j]`, `mask`, and `j`.***
