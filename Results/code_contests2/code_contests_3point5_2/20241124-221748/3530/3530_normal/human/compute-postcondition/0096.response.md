Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The previous values of `i`, `n`, and `mask` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation**
