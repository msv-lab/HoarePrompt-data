According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `mask` is in the range from 1 to 1 shifted left by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `mask` is increased by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `mask` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range from 1 to 1 shifted left by `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `mask` is increased by 2.**
