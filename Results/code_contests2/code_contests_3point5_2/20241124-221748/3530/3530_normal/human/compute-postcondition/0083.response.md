Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, where `j` is the value of the bit position. The previous values of `i` and `n` are 2 and greater than 0, respectively. The specific values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` are not provided, so the output state is: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned**
