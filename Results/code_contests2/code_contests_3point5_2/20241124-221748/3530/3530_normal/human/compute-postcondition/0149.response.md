According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n+1` to ensure that the loop can run again.
State: **The program updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo operation with `MOD` if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true. The value of `j` is less than `n+1`**
