According to the code, the loop will execute at least once if n is greater than 0. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is set to 0. Additionally, after the loop executes, the state should be adjusted such that `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `mask` is increased by 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
State after the loop: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is increased by 2**
