Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `mask` is updated to the next value within the range of (1, 1 << n), `a` is a matrix. If the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is true, then dp[i][mask] is increased by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taken modulo MOD. All variables maintain their initial conditions, and the matrix a is unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
