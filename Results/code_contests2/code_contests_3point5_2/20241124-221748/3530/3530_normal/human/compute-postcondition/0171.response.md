According to the code, the loop can execute again if the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true for at least one value of `j` in the range of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the `mask` should be adjusted such that these conditions are met.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `mask` needs to be adjusted to satisfy the conditions stated above.

State: **After the loop executes, `mask` is adjusted such that there exists at least one value of `j` in the range of `n` where `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true**.
