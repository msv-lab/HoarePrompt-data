Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `dp` array is updated based on conditions involving matrices `a`, `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `dp` array is updated based on conditions involving matrices `a`, `j` is incremented by 1**
