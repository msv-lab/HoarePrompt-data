According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and its relationship with `n+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `n+1`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **No adjustments needed, `j` is incremented by 1**
