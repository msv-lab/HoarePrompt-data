Example Answer:
The element `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. All variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the first row of the 2D list `dp` have been updated accordingly, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1.
Output State: **All elements in the first row of the 2D list `dp` have been updated accordingly, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1**
