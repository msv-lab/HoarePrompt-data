Example Answer:
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions (n+1) rows and (1 << n) columns, where each row is filled with zeros. The values of `n` and `MOD` are known, and based on the initial state, `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the output state is: `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the result of mapping integers from the input split, `_` is less than `n`, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) rows and (1 << n) columns filled with zeros.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the result of mapping integers from the input split, `_` is less than `n`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) rows and (1 << n) columns filled with zeros**
