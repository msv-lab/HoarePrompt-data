According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0. Since `j` is 0, the next iteration should have `j` as 1 for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All elements in the first row of the 2D list `dp` are set to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1**
