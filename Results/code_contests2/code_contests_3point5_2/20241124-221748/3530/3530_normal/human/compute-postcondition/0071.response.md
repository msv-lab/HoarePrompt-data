According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop ended with `n` being greater than 0. Therefore, the loop will execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next value after the previous iteration. 
State: **Output State: i is incremented by 1**
