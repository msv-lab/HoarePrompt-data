Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of `dp[i][mask]` with `MOD`. The previous values of `i`, `n`, and `dp[i][mask]` are 2, greater than 0, and updated respectively. After the operation, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the modulus operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the modulus operation.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the modulus operation**
