According to the code, the loop will execute if n is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, all elements in the first row of the 2D list dp are set to 1, and if n is 0, the loop does not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, n must be greater than 0 and the first row of the 2D list dp must be set to 1.
State: **all elements in the first row of the 2D list dp are set to 1, n is greater than 0**
