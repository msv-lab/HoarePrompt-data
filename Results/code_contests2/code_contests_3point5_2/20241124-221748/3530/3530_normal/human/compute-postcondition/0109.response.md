Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. If the element at position (i-1, j) in matrix `a` is 1 and the j-th bit in variable `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the if statement execution, ensuring the correct update of `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions specified.***
