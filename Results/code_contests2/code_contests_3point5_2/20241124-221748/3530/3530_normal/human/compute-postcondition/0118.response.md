According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3 for the next iteration.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 3, `dp` array values are updated based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`**
