Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `mask` is increased by 2. The loop iterates through each value of `j` in the range of `n` and checks if the element at position (i-1, j) in matrix `a` is 1 and if the j-th bit in variable `mask` is set. If these conditions are met, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The output state covers all possible scenarios of the if statement execution, ensuring the correct update of `dp[i][mask]` based on the specified conditions. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and the variables remain in their initial state.**
