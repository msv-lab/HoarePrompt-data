Postcondition: ***All elements in the first row of the 2D list `dp` have been updated according to the condition specified. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, `mask` remains as 1, and `j` is still 1. If the element at index (i - 1, j) in the 2D list `a` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 left-shifted by `j` is true, then the element at index (i, mask) in the 2D list `dp` is incremented by the value at index (i - 1, mask XOR 1 left-shifted by `j`). The result is then taken modulo MOD. This condition holds true for all possible cases and edge scenarios.***
