Postcondition: ***The variables `mask`, `n`, `a`, `dp`, and `i` remain unchanged. If there exists at least one value of `j` in the range of `n` where `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are both true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulus by `MOD`. All other variables retain their initial values. If the condition is not met, there is no change in the program state.***
