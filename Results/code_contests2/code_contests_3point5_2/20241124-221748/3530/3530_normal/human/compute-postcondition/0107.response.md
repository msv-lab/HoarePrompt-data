Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The initial values of `n` and `j` do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. The element at position (i-1, j) in matrix `a` is 1 and the j-th bit in the variable `mask` is set, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. The element at position (i-1, j) in matrix `a` is 1 and the j-th bit in the variable `mask` is set, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
