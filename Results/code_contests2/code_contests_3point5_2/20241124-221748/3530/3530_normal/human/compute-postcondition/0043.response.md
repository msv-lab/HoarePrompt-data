According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `j`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
