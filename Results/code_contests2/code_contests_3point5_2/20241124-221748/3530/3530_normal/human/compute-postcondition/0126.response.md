Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The elements in the (i-1)th row and jth column of matrix `a` are 1, and the jth bit of `mask` is set. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `dp` array is updated based on conditions involving matrices `a`. The element in the (i-1)th row and jth column of matrix `a` is 1, the jth bit of `mask` is set, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
