Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the elements of my_list separated by spaces after converting each element to a string. If test_list is empty, my_list will remain empty and nothing will be printed. If my_list contains elements, they will be printed as described. Therefore, the Output State is: my_list contains the count of each element in test_list, with each count appended.
Output State: **my_list contains the count of each element in test_list, with each count appended**
