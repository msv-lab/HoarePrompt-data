Example Answer:
A float value `e` is appended to the empty list `test_list`. Since `e` is provided as an input float, it will be added to the `test_list`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: m is a positive integer, test_list contains the float value `e`.
Output State: **m is a positive integer, test_list contains the float value `e`**
