According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. If `test_list` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `my_list` is an empty list, it needs to be adjusted so that `test_list` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute, `i` needs to be the first element in `test_list`.
State: **`my_list` is an empty list, `test_list` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `test_list`**
