Example Answer:
The value of e is assigned the float value of the input. Since the previous values of m and test_list are known and not affected by this code, the output state is: m is a positive integer, test_list is an empty list, e is an input float.
Output State: **m is a positive integer, test_list is an empty list, e is an input float**
