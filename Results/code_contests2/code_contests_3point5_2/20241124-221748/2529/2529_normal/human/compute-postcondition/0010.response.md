Example Answer:
The value `e` is appended to the `test_list`. The `test_list` originally contains the float value `e`. After execution, the `test_list` will have two elements with the same float value `e`. The value of `m` is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`m` is m + 2; `test_list` contains two float values of `e`**
