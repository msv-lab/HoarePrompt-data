Example Answer:
The count of the first element in `test_list` is appended to `my_list`. Since `test_list` has at least 2 elements, the count will always be at least 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `my_list` contains the count of the first element in `test_list`, `test_list` has at least 2 elements with the updated count appended.
Output State: **`my_list` contains the count of the first element in `test_list`, `test_list` has at least 2 elements with the updated count appended**
