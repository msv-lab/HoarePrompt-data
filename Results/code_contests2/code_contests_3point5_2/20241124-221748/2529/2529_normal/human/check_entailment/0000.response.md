Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program description specifies that the input expressions consist of an opening parenthesis, a positive integer a of up to two decimal digits, a plus sign, a positive integer b of up to two decimal digits, a closing parenthesis, a slash, and a positive integer c of up to two decimal digits. However, the code is reading float values directly from input without considering the specified format of the expressions. This means that if the input expressions do not follow the exact format described in the problem description, the code will not work correctly. 

Additionally, the output hints mention that the function reads an integer `m` from input, but the code is actually reading float values directly. This discrepancy indicates that the output hints do not agree with the code, making it difficult to determine the correctness of the code based on the provided information.
