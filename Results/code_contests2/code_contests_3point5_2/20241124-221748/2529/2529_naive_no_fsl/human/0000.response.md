Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description. The input format in the program is different from the specified format in the problem description. The program expects float inputs, while the problem description clearly states that the input will be in the form of arithmetic expressions like (a+b)/c. This inconsistency makes the program incorrect as it will not be able to handle the input as described in the problem.
