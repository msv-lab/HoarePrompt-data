Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the input format specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the input will be in the form of arithmetic expressions, but the program is trying to read float values directly, which will cause a ValueError. Additionally, the program is not parsing the arithmetic expressions to calculate the coordinates correctly.

An example input that will cause the program to fail:
Input
```
3
(4+5)/2
(3+6)/3
(7+8)/5
```

Expected Output
```
2 2 1
```

The program will fail to correctly calculate the number of ships at each coordinate due to the issues mentioned above.
