According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `test_list` contains the input float `e`. Since `m` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `m`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be 1.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `test_list` contains the input float `e`**
