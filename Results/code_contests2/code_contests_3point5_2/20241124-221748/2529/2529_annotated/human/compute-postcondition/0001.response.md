Example Answer:
The empty list `test_list` is initialized. The variable `m` representing the number of ships is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: m is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **m is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` is an empty list**
