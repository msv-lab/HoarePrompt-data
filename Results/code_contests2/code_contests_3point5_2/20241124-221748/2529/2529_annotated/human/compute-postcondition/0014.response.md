According to the code, the loop will execute if `test_list` is not empty. Since `my_list` is an empty list, it needs to be adjusted so that `test_list` is not empty. Additionally, since the loop is iterating over `test_list`, the loop will execute if there is at least one element in `test_list`. Therefore, `i` should be the first element in `test_list` for the loop to execute.
State: **`my_list` is an empty list, `test_list` is not empty, `i` is the first element in `test_list`**
