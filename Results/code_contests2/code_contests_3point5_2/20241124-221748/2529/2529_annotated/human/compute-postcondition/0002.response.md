According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `test_list` being empty does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `m` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0, and `i` should be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `test_list` is an empty list**
