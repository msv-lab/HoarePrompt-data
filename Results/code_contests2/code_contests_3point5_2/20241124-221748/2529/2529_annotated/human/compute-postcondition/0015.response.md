Example Answer:
The code appends the count of the first element `i` in `test_list` to `my_list`. Since `test_list` is not empty and `i` is the first element, the count of `i` in `test_list` will be at least 1. Therefore, `my_list` will have at least one element after execution.
Output State: **`my_list` is a list containing at least one count of the first element in `test_list`, `test_list` is not empty, `i` is the first element in `test_list`**
