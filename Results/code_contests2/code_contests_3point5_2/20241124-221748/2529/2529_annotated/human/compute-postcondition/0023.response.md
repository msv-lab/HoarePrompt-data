The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function `func` calculates and returns the total distance covered by a fleet of ships based on their jump coordinates. The total distance is calculated by summing up all the jumps made by each ship, where each jump coordinate is given in the form (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers of up to two decimal digits. The function returns the total distance covered by the fleet of ships as a floating-point number.
