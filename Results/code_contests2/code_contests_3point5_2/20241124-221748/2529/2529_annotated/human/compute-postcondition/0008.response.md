According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. This means the loop can execute one more time. The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `test_list` contains the input float `e` appended**
