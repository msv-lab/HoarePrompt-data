Example Answer:
The code appends the value of `e` to the `test_list`. The value of `e` is an input float, and `test_list` was initially an empty list. After execution, the `test_list` will contain the value of `e`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `test_list` contains the input float `e`.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `test_list` contains the input float `e`**
