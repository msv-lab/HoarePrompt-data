Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, where `raw_input` accepts an input. Since the initial state mentions that `p` is a string containing only characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126 (inclusive), the variable `a` would also be a string satisfying the same conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing only characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126 (inclusive), `a` is a string containing only characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126 (inclusive).
Output State: **`p` is a string containing only characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126 (inclusive), `a` is a string containing only characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126 (inclusive)**
