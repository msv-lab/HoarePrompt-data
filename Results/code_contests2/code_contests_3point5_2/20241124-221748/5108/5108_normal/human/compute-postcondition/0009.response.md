Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the value `'tstr123'`, which means it is no longer retaining its original value. The variable `i` is set to the second character in `a`, which is `'s'`. The variable `p` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing only characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's'.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing only characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's'**
