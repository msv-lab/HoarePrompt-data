Example Answer:
The code snippet does not affect the variables `p`, `a`, or `i`. The `print('YES')` statement simply outputs 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing only characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, `a` is either 'tstr123' or it retains its original value, `i` is the second character in string `a`.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing only characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, `a` is either 'tstr123' or it retains its original value, `i` is the second character in string `a`**
