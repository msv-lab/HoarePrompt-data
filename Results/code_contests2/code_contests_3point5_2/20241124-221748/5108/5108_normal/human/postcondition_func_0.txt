The function `func` reads input from the user, iterates over each character in the input. If the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9' are found, it prints 'YES', sets `a` to 'tstr123', and breaks the loop. If none of these characters are present, no changes occur, and no output is produced. After the loop, if `a` is not 'tstr123', it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
