According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the string `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `a`. To execute the loop one more time, the string `a` should still have more characters after the first character. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`a` is a non-empty string with more characters after the first character, `i` is the next character in `a`**
