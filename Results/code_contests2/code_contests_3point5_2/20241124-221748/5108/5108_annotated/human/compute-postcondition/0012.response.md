According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in string `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty string with more characters after the first character, and `i` is the next character in `a`. To execute the loop one more time, the next character `i` should not be in ['H', 'Q', '9']. So, the next character `i` should be different from 'H', 'Q', '9'.
State: **`a` is a non-empty string with more characters after the next character, `i` is the character after the next character in `a` and not in ['H', 'Q', '9']**
