Example Answer: 
The code snippet contains a `break` statement, which is typically used to break out of loops or switch statements. In this case, we are not inside any loop or switch statement, so the `break` statement has no effect on the program. The initial state remains the same.
Output State: **`a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's'**
