According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty string with more characters after the next character, and `i` is the character after the next character in `a` and not in ['H', 'Q', '9']. 

To execute the loop one more time:
- If `i` is in ['H', 'Q', '9'], then 'YES' is printed, `a` is set to 'tstr123', and the execution breaks.
- If `i` is not in ['H', 'Q', '9'], then the loop will continue without any changes to the values of `a` and `i`.

State: **`a` is a non-empty string with more characters after the character following `i`, `i` is the character following the next character in `a` and not in ['H', 'Q', '9']**
