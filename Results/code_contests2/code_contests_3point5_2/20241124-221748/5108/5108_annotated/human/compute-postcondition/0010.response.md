Example Answer: 
The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
