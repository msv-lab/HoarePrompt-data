Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty string with more characters after the next character, `i` is the character after the next character in `a` and not in ['H', 'Q', '9']. If `i` is in ['H', 'Q', '9'], then 'YES' is printed, `a` is set to 'tstr123', and the execution breaks. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `a` and `i`.***
