Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty string with more characters after the first character, `i` is the next character in `a`. If `i` is found in ['H', 'Q', '9'], then 'YES' is printed, `a` is updated to 'tstr123', and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `a` and `i`.***
