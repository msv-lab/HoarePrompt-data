Example Answer:
The variable `a` is reassigned to the string 'tstr123'. The value of `i` is the first character of the new string `a`, which is 't'. The first character `i` does not belong to the list ['H', 'Q', '9']. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 't' and the first character `i` does not belong to the list ['H', 'Q', '9'].
Output State: **`a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 't' and the first character `i` does not belong to the list ['H', 'Q', '9']**
