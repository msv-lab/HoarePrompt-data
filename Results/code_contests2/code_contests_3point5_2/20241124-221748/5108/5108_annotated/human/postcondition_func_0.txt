The function reads user input, checks if the input contains any of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If it does, it prints 'YES', updates the value of `a` to 'tstr123' and stops. If none of the characters are found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
