Postcondition: ***If S contains only 'I' characters, the result is equal to the length of S. If S contains only 'D' characters, the result is equal to the negative length of S. If S contains a mix of 'I' and 'D' characters, the final result depends on the number of 'I' and 'D' characters in S. If N is 0, the loop does not execute and the result remains 0. After the execution of the if block, if the result is less than 0, it is set to 0.***
