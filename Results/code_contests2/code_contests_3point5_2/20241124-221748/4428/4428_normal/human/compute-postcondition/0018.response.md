Output State: **If S contains only 'I' characters, then result is equal to the length of S. If S contains only 'D' characters, then result is equal to the negative length of S. If S contains a mix of 'I' and 'D' characters, the final result depends on the number of 'I' and 'D' characters in S. If N is 0, the loop does not execute and result remains 0.**
