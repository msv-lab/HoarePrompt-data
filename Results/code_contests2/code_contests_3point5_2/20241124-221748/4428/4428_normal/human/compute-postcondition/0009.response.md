According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` remains 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D', i is 1**
