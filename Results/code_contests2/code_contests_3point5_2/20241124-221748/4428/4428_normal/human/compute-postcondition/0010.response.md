Example Answer: 
The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, so after execution, `result` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D', i is 1, result is incremented by 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D', i is 1, result is incremented by 1**
