Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer representing the length of the string S with at least 1 character, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D'. If the character at index i in string S is 'I', then the result is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the character at index i in string S is 'D', then the result is decremented by 1. This covers all possible cases of incrementing and decrementing result based on the character at index i in string S.***
