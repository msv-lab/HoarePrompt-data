Postcondition: ***N is at least 1, S is a string. The loop executed for each character in S. If S[i] is 'I', result was incremented by 1; if S[i] is 'D', result was decremented by 1. The final result after the loop reflected the total changes based on the characters in the string S. If N is 0, the loop did not execute and result remained 0. result is less than 0***
