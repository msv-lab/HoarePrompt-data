Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer representing the length of the string S with at least 1 character, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D'. If S[i] == 'I', the result is increased by 1; if S[i] == 'D', the result is decreased by 1. The program handles all edge cases where 'I' and 'D' are correctly processed, ensuring the final result reflects the appropriate changes based on the characters in the string.***
