Example Answer: 
The value of `result` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer representing the length of the string S with at least 1 character, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D'; result is decremented by 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer representing the length of the string S with at least 1 character, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D'; result is decremented by 1**
