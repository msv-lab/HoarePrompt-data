Example Answer: 
`result` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, so the new value of `result` is 1 less than its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer representing the length of the string S with at least 1 character, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D', `i` is less than N; result is 1 less than its previous value.
Output State: **N is a positive integer representing the length of the string S with at least 1 character, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D', `i` is less than N; result is 1 less than its previous value**
