Example Answer:
The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer representing the length of the string S with at least 1 character, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D', `i` is less than N, `result` is increased by 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer representing the length of the string S with at least 1 character, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D', `i` is less than N, `result` is increased by 1**
