Example Answer:
`t` and `x` are assigned the values of `float(input().split())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `split()` splits the input into separate values. Since `t` and `x` are positive integers, the values are converted to float. The output state is: t and x are positive floats.
Output State: **t and x are positive floats**
