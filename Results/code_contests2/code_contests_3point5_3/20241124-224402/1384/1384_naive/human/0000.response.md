Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input values of T and X as integers, then calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A by dividing T by X. The output is then printed with 10 decimal places, as required by the problem description. The program handles all potential cases where T and X are within the given constraints and provides the expected output.
