Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It takes two integer inputs, `t` and `x`, calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B, and then prints the result. The use of `map(float, input().split())` ensures that the inputs are converted to floats for accurate division. The output is also formatted correctly according to the problem description. 

I have reviewed the problem description and the program, and I couldn't find any potential case where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
