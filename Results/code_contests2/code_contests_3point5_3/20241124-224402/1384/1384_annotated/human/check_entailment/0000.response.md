Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes two inputs T and X, calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B, and outputs the result. The calculation is done correctly by dividing T by X, which aligns with the problem description. The program handles float inputs and outputs the result with the required precision. I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
