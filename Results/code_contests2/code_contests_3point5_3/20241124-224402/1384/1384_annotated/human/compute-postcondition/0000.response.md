Example Answer:
t and x are assigned the values of float(input().split()), where input accepts an input and split() splits the input by spaces and float converts them to floating-point numbers. Since the initial state does not specify the input values, the output state will be t and x are floating-point numbers.
Output State: **t and x are floating-point numbers**
