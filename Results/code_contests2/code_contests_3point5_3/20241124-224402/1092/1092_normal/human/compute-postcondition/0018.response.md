According to the code, the loop will execute if there are more elements in list `l` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains greater than 0, `m` is the maximum value between the count of uppercase letters in the last word in list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is the last word in list `l`, `s` is the count of uppercase letters in the string `i`. If `i` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `s` remains 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **After the loop executes, `n` remains greater than 0, `m` is the maximum value between the count of uppercase letters in the last word in list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is the second to last word in list `l`, `s` is the count of uppercase letters in the string `i`. If `i` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `s` remains 0.**
