According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more characters to iterate in the non-empty string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate, and `j` is the next character in `i`. If `j` is an uppercase character, `s` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `j` in `i` must be available. Therefore, `j` should be the character after the current `j` in the string `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate, the next character in `i` is the next character after the current `j`, `s` may be increased based on the new `j`**
