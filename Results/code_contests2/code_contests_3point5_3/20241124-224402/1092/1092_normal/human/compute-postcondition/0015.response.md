According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `i` and the current character `j`. If there are more characters left in `i` to iterate, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate, the next character in `i` is the next character after the current `j`, `s` is increased by 1 if `j` is an uppercase character. No changes occur to `n`, `m`, `i`, or `s` if `j` is not an uppercase character. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `i` should be the one after the current `j`. If `j` is an uppercase character, `s` should be increased by 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate, the next character in `i` is the next character after the current `j`, `s` is increased by 1 if `j` is an uppercase character.**
