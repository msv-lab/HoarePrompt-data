Postcondition: ***`n` remains greater than 0, `m` is the maximum value between the count of uppercase letters in the new last word in list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is the new last word in list `l`, `s` is increased by 1 if the condition `j.isupper()` is true, `j` represents the elements of `i` as the loop iterates. This postcondition accounts for the scenario where `j` is an uppercase letter, resulting in `s` being incremented by 1 while maintaining the initial conditions and relationships specified in the precondition.***
