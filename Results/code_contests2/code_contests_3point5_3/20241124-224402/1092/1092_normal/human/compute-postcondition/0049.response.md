Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` remains greater than 0, `m` captures the maximum count of uppercase letters in any word in list `l`, `i` iterates through each word in list `l`, `s` is the count of uppercase letters in the current word. If `l` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `m` remains 0. If a word in `l` is an empty string, the inner loop does not execute for that word and `s` remains 0.**
