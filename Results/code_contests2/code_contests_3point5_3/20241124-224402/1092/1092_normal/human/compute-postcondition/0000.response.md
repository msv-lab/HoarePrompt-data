Example Answer:
The `raw_input()` function reads input from the user, but it does not store the input in any variable. Since there are no variables affected or changed by this operation, the state remains the same.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200. The text consists of n single-space separated words, each word consisting of small and capital Latin letters.**
