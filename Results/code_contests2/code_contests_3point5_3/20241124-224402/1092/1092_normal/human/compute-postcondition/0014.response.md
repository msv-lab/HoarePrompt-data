Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate, the next character in `i` is the next character after the current `j`, `s` is increased by 1 if `j` is an uppercase character. No changes occur to `n`, `m`, `i`, or `s` if `j` is not an uppercase character.***
