According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and the list `l`. If there are more elements in the list `l` after the last word `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains greater than 0, `m` is updated based on the conditions, `i` is the last word in list `l`, `s` is recalculated based on the updated `i`, `j` is the next element in the new value of `i`. If `j` is an uppercase letter, then `s` is increased by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` should be updated to the next word in the list `l`.
- `s` should be recalculated based on the updated `i`.
- `j` should be updated to the next element in the new value of `i`.
- If the new `j` is an uppercase letter, `s` should be increased by 1.

State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `m` is updated based on the conditions, `i` is the next word in list `l`, `s` is recalculated based on the updated `i`, `j` is the next element in the new value of `i`. If `j` is an uppercase letter, then `s` is increased by 1**
