Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an input, splits it into words, and then calculates and prints the maximum count of uppercase letters in any word. It does not accept any parameters explicitly. The function assumes the input text consists of words separated by spaces. The function does not return any value explicitly. However, there might be potential issues with empty lists or empty strings within the input text that are not handled explicitly.**
