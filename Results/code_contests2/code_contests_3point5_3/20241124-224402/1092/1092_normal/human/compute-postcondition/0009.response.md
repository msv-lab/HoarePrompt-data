According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the `i` string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is a non-empty string, and `j` is the first character of `i`. If `j` is an uppercase letter, `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, or `s. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the string `i` must be available.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate, `j` is the next character in `i`.**
