According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the list `l` has at least 1 word. Since `n` represents the number of words in the list `l`, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the loop, `m` is 0 which does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, and `i` is the first word in list `l`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`**
