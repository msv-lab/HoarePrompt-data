Postcondition: ***`n` remains greater than 0, `m` is updated based on the conditions, `i` is the next word in list `l`, `s` is recalculated based on the updated `i`. If `j` is an uppercase letter, then `s` is increased by 1 after the execution of the if block. All initial conditions are retained, and the program state is modified accordingly based on the uppercase nature of `j`.***
