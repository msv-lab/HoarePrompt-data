Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the volume of the given text by finding the maximum count of uppercase letters in a word in the text. It iterates through each word in the text, counts the number of uppercase letters in each word, and keeps track of the maximum count encountered. Finally, it prints the maximum count, which represents the volume of the text.

The program logic aligns with the problem description and handles both uppercase and lowercase letters. It correctly calculates the volume of the text for all potential cases.
