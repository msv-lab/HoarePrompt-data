According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `l`. The loop will iterate over each word in the list. Before the loop starts, `m` is 0 indicates that the loop has not yet executed. To ensure the loop executes, the list `l` must have at least 1 word, and `i` should be the first word in the list.
State: **`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list**
