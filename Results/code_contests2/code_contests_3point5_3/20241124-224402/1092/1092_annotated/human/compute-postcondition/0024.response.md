According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the iterable object `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between s and m, `i` is an iterable object containing words, `j` is assigned the first word in `i`, `s` is the maximum value between s and m. If the first word in `i` is in uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `l` remains a list of n words with at least 1 word.
- `m` remains the maximum value between s and m.
- `i` remains the iterable object containing words.
- `j` needs to be assigned the next word in `i`.
- `s` needs to be the maximum value between s and m.
- If the next word in `i` is in uppercase, `s` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between s and m, `i` is an iterable object containing words, `j` is assigned the next word in `i`, `s` is the maximum value between s and m.**
