According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is iterable. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 1 if the first character of the first word in the list is an uppercase letter. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to move to the next word in the list. Therefore, the next word in the list becomes `i`.
State: **`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the next word in the list, `s` is 1 if the first character of the next word in the list is an uppercase letter**
