According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more words left in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the next word in the list, and `s` is either 0 or 1. If the first character of the next word in the list is an uppercase letter, `s` is incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next word in the list should not be the last word in the list. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to the next word in the list. If the first character of the next word is an uppercase letter, `s` should be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the next word in the list, and `s` is either 0 or 1**
