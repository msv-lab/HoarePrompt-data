According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since `i` is the first word in the list, and the loop is iterating over `i`, the loop will execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `j` is the first character of the first word in the list.
State: **`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 0, `j` is the first character of the first word in the list**
