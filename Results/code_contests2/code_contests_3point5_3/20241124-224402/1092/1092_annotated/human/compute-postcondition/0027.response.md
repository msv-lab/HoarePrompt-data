According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more words in the iterable object `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is an iterable object containing words, `j` is assigned the next word in `i`, `s` is the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1`. If `j` is uppercase, `s` is increased by 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the conditions should be as follows:
- `l` remains a list of n words with at least 1 word.
- `m` remains the maximum value between `s` and `m`.
- `i` remains an iterable object containing words.
- `j` should be assigned the next word in `i`.
- `s` should be the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1`.
- If `j` is uppercase, `s` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is an iterable object containing words, `j` is assigned the next word in `i`, `s` is the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1`**
