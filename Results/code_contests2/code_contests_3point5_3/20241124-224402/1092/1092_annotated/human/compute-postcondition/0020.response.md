According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is an iterable object such as a list or a string. Since `i` is the next word in the list, it should be an iterable object containing words. Additionally, `j` will iterate over the elements of `i` so `j` can take one of the words from `i`. In order for the loop to execute, `i` must be iterable, `j` should be assigned the first word in `i`, and `s` should be updated to be the maximum value between `s` and `m`.
State: **`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between s and m, `i` is an iterable object containing words, `j` is assigned the first word in `i`, `s` is the maximum value between s and m**
