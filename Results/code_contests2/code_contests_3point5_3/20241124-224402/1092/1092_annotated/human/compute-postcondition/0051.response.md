The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on the precondition that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200. The function processes a text consisting of n single-space separated words, each consisting of small and capital Latin letters. The function does not return any specific value, as the output is not specified.
