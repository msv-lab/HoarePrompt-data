Postcondition: ***`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between s and m, `i` is an iterable object containing words, `j` is assigned the next word in `i`, `s` is the maximum value between s and m + 1. If `j` is uppercase, `s` is increased by 1. Overall, after the if statement executes, the program variables retain their initial conditions except that if `j` is uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1.***
