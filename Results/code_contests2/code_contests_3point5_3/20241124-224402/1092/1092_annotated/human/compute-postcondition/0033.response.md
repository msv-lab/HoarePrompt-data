According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more words in the list `l` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is an iterable object containing words, `j` is assigned the next word in `i`, `s` is the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1`. If `j` is in uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1, `m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` and `m`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should still contain more words to iterate over, and `j` should be assigned the next word in `i`.
State: **`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is an iterable object containing words with more words to iterate over, `j` is assigned the next word in `i`, `s` is the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1**.
