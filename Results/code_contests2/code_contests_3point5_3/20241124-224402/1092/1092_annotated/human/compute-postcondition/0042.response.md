According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the iterable object `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is an iterable object containing more than 1 word, `j` is assigned the second word in `i`, `s` is the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1`, `s` is 1 if the second word in `i` is uppercase, otherwise `s` remains 0. If the second word in `i` is uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted so that the next iteration can occur. In this case, `i` needs to contain more than 2 words, and `j` should be assigned the third word in `i`.
State: **`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is an iterable object containing more than 2 words, `j` is assigned the third word in `i`, `s` is the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1`, `s` is 1 if the third word in `i` is uppercase, otherwise `s` remains 0. If the third word in `i` is uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1**.
