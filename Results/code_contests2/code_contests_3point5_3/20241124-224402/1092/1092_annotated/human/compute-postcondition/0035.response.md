According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is not empty. The loop iterates over the words in `i`, so for the loop to execute, `i` must contain more than 1 word. The variable `j` is assigned the next word in `i`, so initially `j` should be assigned the first word in `i`. At the end of the loop, `s` should be the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is an iterable object containing more than 1 word, `j` is assigned the first word in `i`, `s` is the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1, `s` is 0**
