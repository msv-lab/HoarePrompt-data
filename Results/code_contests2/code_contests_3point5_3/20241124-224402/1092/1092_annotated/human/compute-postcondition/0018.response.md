According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more words left in the list `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between s and m, `i` is the next word in the list, `s` is the count of words where the first character is an uppercase letter in the list. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the next word `i` needs to be the word following the current word, and `s` needs to be updated based on the next word's first character. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between s and m, `i` is the next word in the list, `s` is the count of words where the first character is an uppercase letter in the list**
