According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the iterable object `i`. If `i` has more words to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is an iterable object containing more than 2 words, `j` is assigned the third word in `i`, `s` is the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If the third word in `i` is uppercase, `s` should be incremented by 1 and set to the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1`.
2. If the third word in `i` is not uppercase, `s` should be set to the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1`.

State: **`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is an iterable object containing more than 2 words, `j` is assigned the third word in `i`, `s` is the updated value based on the conditions above**
