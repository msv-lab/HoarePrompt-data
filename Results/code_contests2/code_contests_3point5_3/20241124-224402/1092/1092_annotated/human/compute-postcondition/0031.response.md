Output State: 
- `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word
- `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`
- `i` is an iterable object containing words
- `j` is assigned the next word in `i`
- `s` is the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1`. If `j` is in uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1.

If the iterable object `i` does not contain any uppercase words, the loop will not execute and `s` will remain 0.
