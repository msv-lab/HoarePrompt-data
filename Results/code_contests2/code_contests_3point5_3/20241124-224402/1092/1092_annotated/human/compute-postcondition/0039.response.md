According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more words in the iterable object `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is an iterable object containing more than 1 word, `j` is assigned the first word in `i`, `s` is the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1`, `s` is 1 if the first word in `i` is uppercase. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. The list `l` should still have n words with at least 1 word.
2. The maximum value `m` should remain the same.
3. The iterable object `i` must still contain more than 1 word.
4. The variable `j` should now be assigned the second word in `i`.
5. The maximum value `s` should be updated to be the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1`.
6. The value of `s` should be 1 if the second word in `i` is uppercase. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.

State: **`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is an iterable object containing more than 1 word, `j` is assigned the second word in `i`, `s` is the maximum value between `s` and `m + 1`, `s` is 1 if the second word in `i` is uppercase. Otherwise, `s` remains 0**
