Example Answer:
`s` is incremented by 1 if the first character of the next word in the list is an uppercase letter. The initial state indicates that `s` is 0, and `i` is the next word in the list. After execution, if the condition is met, `s` will be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the next word in the list, and `s` is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **`l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the next word in the list, and `s` is either 0 or 1**
