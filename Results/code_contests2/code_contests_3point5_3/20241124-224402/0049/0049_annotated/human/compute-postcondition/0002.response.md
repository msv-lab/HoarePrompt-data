Example Answer: 
`c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, but the state of `n` is unknown as it was reassigned to the first element of the list `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is reassigned to the first element of the list `n`, `c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`.
Output State: **`n` is reassigned to the first element of the list `n`, `c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`**
