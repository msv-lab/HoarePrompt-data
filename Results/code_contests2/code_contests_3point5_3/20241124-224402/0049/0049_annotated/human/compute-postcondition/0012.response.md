Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is assigned a value from raw_input(), flag is True if c[i] > c[i + 1], pos is equal to i in that case, i is less than n - 2. If c[i] > c[i + 1], flag is set to True and pos is assigned the value of i. In all other cases, flag remains False.***
