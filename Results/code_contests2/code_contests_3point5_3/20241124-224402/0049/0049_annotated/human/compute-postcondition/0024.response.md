Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is assigned a value from raw_input(). If there exists at least one pair of elements in c where the first element is greater than the second, flag is True and pos is assigned the index of the first such pair. If flag is True, then the program prints 'YES' and the indices of the first pair where the first element is greater than the second. If there does not exist any pair of elements where the first element is greater than the second, flag remains False and the program prints 'NO'.***
