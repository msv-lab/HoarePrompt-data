Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the result of mapping `int` to the input split by spaces. Since the input is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5. s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
Output State: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5. s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
