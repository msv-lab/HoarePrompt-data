Example Answer:
The variable `flag` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The previous values of `n` and `c` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is reassigned to the first element of the list `n`, `c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, `flag` is False.
Output State: **`n` is reassigned to the first element of the list `n`, `c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, `flag` is False**
