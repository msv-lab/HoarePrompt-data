Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `c` from the user input. It then loops through the string `c` and checks if there exists at least one pair of elements where the first element is greater than the second. If such a pair is found, it sets a flag to True and stores the index of the first occurrence in `pos`. Finally, the function prints 'YES' along with the indices of the first pair where the condition is met. If no such pair is found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely based on the input provided.**
