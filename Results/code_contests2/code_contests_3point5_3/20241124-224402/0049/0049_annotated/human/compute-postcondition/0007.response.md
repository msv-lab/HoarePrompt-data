Example Answer:
The variable `pos` is assigned the value `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is assigned a value from `raw_input()`, `flag` is True, and `pos` is assigned the value `i`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is assigned a value from `raw_input()`, `flag` is True, `pos` is assigned the value `i`**
