According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is assigned a value from `raw_input()`, `flag` is True if the condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]` is met, and in that case, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. Otherwise, `flag` remains False. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n - 2`.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is assigned a value from `raw_input()`, `flag` is True if the condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]` is met, and in that case, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. Otherwise, `flag` remains False, `i` is less than `n - 2`**
