Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program only checks if there exists at least one pair of adjacent characters in the string where the first character is greater than the second character. However, the problem requires finding a substring that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
aabcfg
```
The expected output should be "NO" since there is no possible substring that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less. However, the given program would output "YES" with indices 3 and 4, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
