Correctness: False

The given program is incorrect because it only checks if there exists at least one decreasing pair of characters in the string. However, it does not guarantee that reversing that substring would result in a lexicographically less string. 

For example, if the input string is "acbd", the program would output "YES 2 3" as there is a decreasing pair "c" and "b". However, reversing this substring would result in "adcb" which is not lexicographically less than "acbd". The correct output should be "NO" for this case. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
