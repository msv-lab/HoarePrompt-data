Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` and a string `c`, then iterates through the elements of `c` to find if there exists a pair of elements where the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it sets `flag` to True and stores the index of the first occurrence in `pos`. After the loop, if `flag` is True, it prints 'YES' followed by the indices `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. If no such pair is found, it prints 'NO'.

The code follows the problem description as it correctly identifies if there exists a substring that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less. It iterates through the string checking for the condition where a character at an index is greater than the character at the next index. If it finds such a pair, it prints the indices of the characters to reverse the substring and outputs 'YES'. If no such pair is found, it outputs 'NO'. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
