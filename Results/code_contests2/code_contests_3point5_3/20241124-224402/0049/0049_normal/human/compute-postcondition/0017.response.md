According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is either True or False, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is either True or False, `i` is 3, `c` is a list of elements**
