Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a string `c`, then iterates through the elements of `c` to find if there exists a pair of elements where the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it sets `flag` to True and stores the index of the first occurrence in `pos`. After the loop, if `flag` is True, it prints 'YES' followed by the indices `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. If no such pair is found, it prints 'NO'.**
