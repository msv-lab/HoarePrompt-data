Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is False or True depending on the condition, `i` is 0, `c` is a list of elements. If the element at index `i` in list `c` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, `flag` is set to True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.***
