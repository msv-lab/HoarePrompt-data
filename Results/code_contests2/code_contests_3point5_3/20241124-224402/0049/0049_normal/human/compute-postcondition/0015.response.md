Example Answer:
The value of `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. Since `i` is 2, the value of `pos` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is True, `i` is 2, `c` is a list of elements, and `pos` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is True, `i` is 2, `c` is a list of elements, `pos` is 2**
