Postcondition: ***If n is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute. If there is at least one pair of elements in list c where the element at index i is greater than the element at index i + 1, flag is True and pos holds the index of the first occurrence. Otherwise, flag remains False. If flag is True, 'YES' is printed, followed by the indices pos + 1 and pos + 2. If the conditions are not met, 'NO' is printed.***
