According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is either True or False, `i` is 0, and `c` is a list of elements. The loop condition requires `i` to be less than `n - 1`, so `i` needs to be adjusted to `1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is False or True, `i` is 1, `c` is a list of elements**
