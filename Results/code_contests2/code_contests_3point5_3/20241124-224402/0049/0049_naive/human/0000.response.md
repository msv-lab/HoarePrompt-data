Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly determines if it is possible to reverse a substring of the given string to obtain a lexicographically less string. It iterates through the string and checks if there exists a character at position i that is greater than the character at position i+1. If such a character is found, it prints "YES" along with the positions of i and i+1. If no such character is found, it prints "NO". The logic implemented in the code is correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
