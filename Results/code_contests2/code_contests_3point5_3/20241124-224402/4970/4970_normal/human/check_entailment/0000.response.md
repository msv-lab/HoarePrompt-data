Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly takes an integer input `a` (0 ≤ a ≤ 15) from the user and prints the element at the index `a` from the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The code aligns with the problem description as it handles all potential cases of `a` within the given range. The output hints also support the code by confirming that the program simply prints the element at the specified index, which the code does effectively. Overall, the code is correct in this case.
