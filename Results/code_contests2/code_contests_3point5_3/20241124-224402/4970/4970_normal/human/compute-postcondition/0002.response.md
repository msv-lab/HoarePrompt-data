Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input a non-negative integer `a` such that 0 <= a <= 15. Then, it prints the element at the index `a` from a predefined list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The function does not return any specific output or perform any specific task beyond printing the element at the given index.**
