The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates solely based on the constraints of a non-negative integer `a` such that 0 <= a <= 15. The function does not return any specific output or perform any specific task. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to be executed without accepting any parameters and without returning any specific output.
