Correctness: True

Explanation: The given Python program takes an integer input and then uses it as an index to retrieve the corresponding value from a hardcoded list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Since the input range is specified as 0 ≤ a ≤ 15, the program covers all possible input values and returns the correct output according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
