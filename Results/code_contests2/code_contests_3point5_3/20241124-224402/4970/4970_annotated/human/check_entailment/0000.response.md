Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program takes an integer input and directly indexes a list of integers to print the corresponding value. Since the program does not have any specific conditions or logic, it will always output the correct integer based on the input. In this case, for any integer input between 0 and 15, the program will output the correct integer as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
