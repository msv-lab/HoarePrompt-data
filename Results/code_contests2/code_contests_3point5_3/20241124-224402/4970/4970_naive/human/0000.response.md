Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program takes an integer input, and based on the input value, it returns the corresponding element from a predefined list. Since the input range is from 0 to 15 and the list contains elements from 0 to 15 in the correct order, the program will always return the correct output for any valid input. Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
