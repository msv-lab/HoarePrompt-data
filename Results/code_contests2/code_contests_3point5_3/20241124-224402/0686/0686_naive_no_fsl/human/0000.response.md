Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program is empty, so it does not have any logic to determine the minimal amount of burles organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations. As a result, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for any input case. Since there is no code to verify, we can confidently say that the program is incorrect for all potential cases.
