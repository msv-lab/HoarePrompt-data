Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on predefined positive integers `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` that satisfy the given constraints. The function should perform calculations on these predefined integers and return a value based on the results. However, the actual code implementation is missing, so the functionality of the function cannot be accurately determined without the code logic. **
