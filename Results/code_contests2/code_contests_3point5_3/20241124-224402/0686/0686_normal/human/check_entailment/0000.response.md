Correctness: **False**

The given code is missing, so it is impossible to determine if it follows the problem description accurately. Without the code implementation, we cannot assess if the functionality aligns with the requirements. The output hints also indicate the absence of the code logic, making it impossible to confirm if the code is correct. Therefore, without the actual code, we cannot determine the correctness of the program.
