Example Answer:
The values of l and r are assigned based on the input split operation, converting the input values to integers. The variables P, N, and Q remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: P is a list of zeros with length N, l and r are assigned values based on the input split operation, Q is incremented by 1.
Output State: **P is a list of zeros with length N, l and r are assigned values based on the input split operation, Q is incremented by 1**
