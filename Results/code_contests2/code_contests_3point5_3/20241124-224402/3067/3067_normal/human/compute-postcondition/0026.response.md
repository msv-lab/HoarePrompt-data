Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', P is a list with elements incrementing by 1 from 0 to N. If i == 0, then P[0] is set to 0. For any index i, if S[i - 1:i + 1] is 'AC', then P[i] is incremented by 1 compared to P[i - 1]. Otherwise, P[i] remains the same as P[i - 1]. This condition covers all cases including the edge cases where i is at the boundaries of the list.***
