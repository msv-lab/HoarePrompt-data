The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates on predefined constraints: **Precondition**: **N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of only `A`, `C`, `G`, and `T`. Each query i has integers l_i and r_i such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N**. The function processes these constraints to perform a specific task, but the exact functionality is not specified in the given information.
