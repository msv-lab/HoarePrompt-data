According to the code, the loop will execute Q times. At the end of the previous iteration, P is a list of zeros with length N, l and r are assigned values based on the input split operation. To execute the loop one more time, you need to adjust the states as follows: l and r are assigned values based on the input split operation again, and the value of Q should be incremented by 1.
State: **P is a list of zeros with length N, l and r are assigned values based on the input split operation, Q is incremented by 1**
