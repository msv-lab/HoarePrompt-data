Example Answer:
The value of P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1]. This means that the value of P[i] will be the same as the value of P[i - 1]. The values of N, S, and other elements in P remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', P is a list of zeros of size N + 1 with the first element set to 0.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', P is a list of zeros of size N + 1 with the first element set to 0**
