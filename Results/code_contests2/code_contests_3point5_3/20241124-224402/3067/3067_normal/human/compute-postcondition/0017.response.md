Example Answer:
P[i] is assigned the value P[i - 1] + 1. The value of P[i - 1] depends on the previous state of P, which is a list of zeros. Therefore, after execution, P[i] will be 1 greater than P[i - 1]. 
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', P is a list with elements incrementing by 1 from 0 to N**
