Example Answer:
The code calculates the difference between the elements at index r-1 and l-1 in the list P. The values of l and r are based on the input split operation. Since P is a list of zeros, the value of P[r-1] will be 0 and the value of P[l-1] will also be 0. Therefore, the output will be 0 - 0 which is 0.
Output State: **P is a list of zeros with length N, l and r are assigned values based on the input split operation, Q is incremented by 1, and the output is 0**
