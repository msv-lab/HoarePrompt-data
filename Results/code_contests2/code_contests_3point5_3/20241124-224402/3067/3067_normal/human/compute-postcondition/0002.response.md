Example Answer:
`P` is a list of size `N + 1` filled with zeros. The values of `N` and `Q` are not affected by this code, and `S` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; P is a list of zeros of size N + 1.
Output State: **N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; P is a list of zeros of size N + 1**
