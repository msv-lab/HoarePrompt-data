Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', P is a list of zeros of size N + 1 with the first element set to 0, i is 0. If i equals 0, then P[0] is set to 0. After the execution of the if else block, if the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1 is 'AC', then P[i] is updated to be P[i - 1] + 1. Otherwise, P[i] is updated to be equal to P[i - 1]. The variables N, S, P, and i are not modified except for the update of P[i] based on the condition. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if else block.***
