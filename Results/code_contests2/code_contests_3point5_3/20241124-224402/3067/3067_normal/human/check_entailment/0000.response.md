Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values N, Q, and the string S from the user.
- It then initializes a list P of size N+1 with all zeros.
- The code then iterates over the string S and updates the P list based on the condition where if the substring at index i-1 to i is 'AC', then the value at index i in list P is updated.
- Finally, for each query, the code calculates the number of occurrences of 'AC' in the substring from index l to r by taking the difference between P[r-1] and P[l-1].
- The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each query.
