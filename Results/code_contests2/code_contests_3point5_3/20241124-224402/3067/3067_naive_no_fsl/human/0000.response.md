Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for N, Q, S, and the queries l and r.
2. It calculates the number of times 'AC' occurs as a substring in the given range [l, r] by precomputing the number of occurrences up to the index r and subtracting the number of occurrences up to the index l.
3. The logic of counting 'AC' substrings is implemented correctly in the program.
4. The program outputs the correct number of occurrences for each query as required by the problem description.
5. The program runs in O(N+Q) time complexity, which is acceptable given the constraints.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
