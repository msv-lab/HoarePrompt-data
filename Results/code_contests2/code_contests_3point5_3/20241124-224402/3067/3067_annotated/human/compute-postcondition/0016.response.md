Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length N, `P` is a list of length N+1 with P[0] = 0, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then the element at index 0 of list P is set to 0 and the loop continues. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `S`, `P`, `N`, and `i`. Ensure all boundary cases are covered, such as when `i` is not equal to 0.***
