Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length N, `P` is a list of length N+1. If the substring of `S` from index i-1 to i+1 is 'AC', then `P[i]` is incremented by 1 compared to `P[i-1]`. Otherwise, `P[i]` is equal to `P[i-1]`. `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `i` equals 0, then `P[0]` is set to 0. In all other cases, there is no change to the values or lengths of `S`, `P`, `N`, and `i`.***
