The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly stated in the function definition. However, based on the given constraints, the function should accept a string `S` of length `N` where each character in `S` is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and a positive integer `Q`. Additionally, the function should handle integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N.

The function should return the functionality based on the given constraints and relationships between the input parameters, but the specific details of this functionality are not provided in the prompt.
