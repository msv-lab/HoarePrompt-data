Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length N, `P` is a list of length N+1 with updated values based on the condition. If `i` is equal to 0, then `P[0]` is updated to 0. If `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is 'AC', then `P[i]` is updated to `P[i - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `P[i]` is updated to `P[i - 1]`. The program ensures that the values of `P` are correctly updated based on the conditions, taking into account all edge cases and preserving the relationships between elements in `P` and characters in `S`.***
