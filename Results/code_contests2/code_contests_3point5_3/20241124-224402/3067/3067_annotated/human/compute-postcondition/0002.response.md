Example Answer: 
A list `P` is initialized with length N+1 containing zeros. Since the value of N is not given, we can only determine that the list `P` will contain N+1 zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: S is a string of length N where each character is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'; P is a list of length N+1 containing zeros.
Output State: **S is a string of length N where each character is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'; P is a list of length N+1 containing zeros**
