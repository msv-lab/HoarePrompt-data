Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length N, `P` is a list of length N+1 with P[0] = 0, `N` is greater than 0. If `S[i - 1:i + 1]` equals 'AC', then the element at index i of list P is incremented by 1 compared to the previous element. Otherwise, the element at index i of list P retains the same value as the previous element. If `i` is equal to 0, then the element at index 0 of list P is set to 0. All boundary cases, including when `i` is not equal to 0, are handled appropriately.***
