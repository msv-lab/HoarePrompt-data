According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of Q. If Q is at least 1, the loop will execute. 

Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states to ensure the loop can execute. 

State: **`S` remains a string of length N, `P` becomes a list of length N+1 with P[0] = 0, `Q` is greater than 0**
