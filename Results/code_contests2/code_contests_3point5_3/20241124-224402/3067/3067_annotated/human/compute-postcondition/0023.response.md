Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length N, `P` is a list of length N+1 with updated values based on the condition, `N` is greater than the current value. If `i` is equal to 0, then `P[0]` is updated to 0. Otherwise, there are no changes to `S` or `P`. The program continues with the updated values of `S` and `P` after the if else block execution.***
