Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values N, Q, S, and the Q queries. It then calculates the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' within the specified ranges [l, r] in the string S. The program uses a prefix sum array P to keep track of the number of occurrences of 'AC' up to index i in the string S. The program correctly calculates the result for each query and prints it. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem description, and there are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program would not work as expected.
