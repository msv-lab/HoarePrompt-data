Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values for N, Q, S, and the queries. It then calculates the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' up to index i and stores it in the list P. Finally, it answers each query by calculating the difference between the number of occurrences at index r and l. The program follows the problem description for every potential case, and there are no edge cases identified where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness is True.
