Example Answer:
The code snippet appends the character at index `k` of the string `Cadena` to the list `Arreglo`. In this case, since `k` is 1, the character at index 1 of `Cadena` will be added to `Arreglo`. The initial state indicates that `Cadena` is a string, `Arreglo` is an empty list, and `k` is 1. After executing the code, the character at index 1 of `Cadena` will be added to `Arreglo`, resulting in the Output State:
Output State: **Cadena is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas and enclosed within opening and closing curved brackets, Arreglo contains the character at index 1 of Cadena, k is 1**
