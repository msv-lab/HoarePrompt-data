Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an input string `Cadena`, extracts characters at every third index starting from index 1, and stores them in a list `Arreglo`. It then prints the count of unique characters in `Arreglo`. The function does not explicitly return any value. It operates on the input provided within the function body.**
