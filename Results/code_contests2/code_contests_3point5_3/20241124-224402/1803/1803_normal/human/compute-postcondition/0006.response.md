Example Answer:
Arreglo is updated by adding the character at index k of Cadena to itself. Since k is 4, the character at index 4 of Cadena is added to Arreglo. The length of Cadena is greater than 4 and greater than 2, so the operation is valid. 
Output State: **Cadena is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas and enclosed within opening and closing curved brackets, Arreglo contains the character at index 1 of Cadena and the character at index 4 of Cadena**
