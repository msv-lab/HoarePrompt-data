Example Answer:
If the length of Cadena is greater than k and greater than 2, Arreglo will contain the characters at index 1, 4, 7, ... of Cadena until the condition is met. The last index accessed will be k - 3. If the length of Cadena is less than or equal to k, or less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute, and Arreglo remains empty. k remains 1. After that, the code prints the length of the list after converting it to a set to remove duplicates.
Output State: **Arreglo contains characters from Cadena, k is updated, and the length of the unique elements in Arreglo is printed.**
