According to the code, the loop will execute if the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and greater than 2. At the end of the last iteration, k is 4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, the length of `Cadena` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 4 and greater than 2.
State: **Cadena is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas and enclosed within opening and closing curved brackets, Arreglo contains the character at index 1 of Cadena, k is 4, and the length of Cadena is greater than 4 and greater than 2**.
