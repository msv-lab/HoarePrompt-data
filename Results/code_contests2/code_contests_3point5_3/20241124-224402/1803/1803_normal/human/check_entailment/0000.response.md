Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is extracting characters at every third index starting from index 1, which is not the correct approach to count the distinct letters in Anton's set. The code is not considering duplicate letters and may miss counting all distinct letters in the set. For example, in the input "{a, b, c, a}", the code would output 1 instead of 3, as it does not handle duplicate letters properly. Additionally, the code has unnecessary conditions and does not provide the correct solution to the problem described.
