Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly count the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. It has a logical error in how it processes the input string. For example, if the input is "{a, b, c}", the program will output 1 instead of 3. This is because the program is not correctly extracting the letters from the input string. It only considers every 3rd character starting from the second character, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program fails to follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
