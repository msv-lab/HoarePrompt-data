Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly count the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set as described in the problem. The program is only extracting characters at specific indices from the input string, which does not accurately capture the distinct letters in the set.

For example, for the input "{a, b, a, c}", the program would output 1 instead of the correct answer which is 3. This demonstrates that the program does not work for all potential cases and thus, the correctness is false.

The logic in the program is incorrect for the problem description.
