Example Answer:
The value at index 1 and index 4 of `Cadena` are added to the list `Arreglo`. As `k` is 7, the element at index 7 of `Cadena` is appended to `Arreglo`. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas inside opening and closing curved brackets, `Arreglo` is a list containing the element at index 1 and index 4 of `Cadena` along with the element at index 7, `k` is 7.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas inside opening and closing curved brackets, `Arreglo` is a list containing the element at index 1 and index 4 of `Cadena` along with the element at index 7, `k` is 7**
