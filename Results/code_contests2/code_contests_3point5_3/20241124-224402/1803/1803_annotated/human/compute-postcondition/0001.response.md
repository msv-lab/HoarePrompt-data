Example Answer:
Since `Arreglo` is initialized as an empty list, the execution of the given code snippet does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas inside opening and closing curved brackets; `Arreglo` is an empty list.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas inside opening and closing curved brackets; `Arreglo` is an empty list**
