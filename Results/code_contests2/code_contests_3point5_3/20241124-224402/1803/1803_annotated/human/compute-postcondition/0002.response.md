`k` is assigned the value `1`, so after execution, `k` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas inside opening and closing curved brackets; `Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas inside opening and closing curved brackets; `Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1**
