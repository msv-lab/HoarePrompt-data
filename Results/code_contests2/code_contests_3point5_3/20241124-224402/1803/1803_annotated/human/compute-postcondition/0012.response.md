Output State: **If the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and greater than 2, then `Arreglo` is a list containing elements at indices `k` in steps of 3 from the initial index, `k` is updated to the next index after the last one used. If the length of `Cadena` is less than or equal to `k` or less than or equal to 2, the loop doesn't execute and `Arreglo` remains an empty list, `k` stays at 1**
