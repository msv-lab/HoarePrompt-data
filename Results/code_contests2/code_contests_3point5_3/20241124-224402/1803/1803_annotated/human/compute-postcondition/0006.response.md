Example Answer: 
The value at index 4 of `Cadena` is added to the `Arreglo`. Given that `Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas inside opening and closing curved brackets, and `k` is 4, the value at index 4 of `Cadena` is extracted and added to `Arreglo`. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas inside opening and closing curved brackets, `Arreglo` is a list containing the element at index 1 of `Cadena` along with the element at index 4, `k` is 4.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters separated by commas inside opening and closing curved brackets, `Arreglo` is a list containing the element at index 1 of `Cadena` along with the element at index 4, `k` is 4**
