Functionality: **The function `func` reads an input string `Cadena` from the user, then processes this string to create a list `Arreglo` containing elements from `Cadena` at specific indices. The function iterates through `Cadena` by increments of 3 starting from index 1 until the length of `Cadena` is less than or equal to `k` or 2. After processing, it prints the number of unique elements in `Arreglo`. It does not accept any parameters.**
