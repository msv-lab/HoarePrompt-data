Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly count the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. It has logic issues that prevent it from working as expected. Here's an example case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
{a, b, a, c}

Expected Output:
3

Actual Output:
2

Explanation:
The program fails to correctly count the distinct letters when a letter is repeated in the set. In this case, the letter 'a' is repeated, but the program only counts it once, leading to an incorrect output.
