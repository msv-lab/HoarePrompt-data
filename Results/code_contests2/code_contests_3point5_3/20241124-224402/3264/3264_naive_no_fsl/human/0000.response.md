Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find Pythagorean triples based on the input side length 'n'. It handles both cases where 'n' is odd and even, and calculates the other two sides of the triangle accordingly. The code also takes care of the edge case where 'n' is less than or equal to 2 and prints -1 in that case. 

Upon reviewing the code and the problem description, it seems that the program covers all possible scenarios and provides the correct output as expected. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
