The function reads an integer input `n`, checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If so, it prints -1. If `n` is greater than 2, it further checks if `n` is odd or even. For odd `n`, it calculates and prints ((n * n - 1) / 2) and ((n * n + 1) / 2). For even `n`, it calculates and prints (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1). The function does not accept any parameters explicitly.
