Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates two values: n * n / 4 - 1 and n * n / 4 + 1. Since n is a positive even integer greater than 2, the output values will be different. For n = 4, the results will be 3 and 5, respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive even integer greater than 2 within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and n is an even number.
Output State: **n is a positive even integer greater than 2 within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and n is an even number**
