Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
