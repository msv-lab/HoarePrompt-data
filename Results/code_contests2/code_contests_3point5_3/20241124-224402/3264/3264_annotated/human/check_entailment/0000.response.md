Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find Pythagorean triples based on the input side length of a right triangle. It covers both odd and even side lengths and generates the corresponding Pythagorean triple. The program satisfies the problem description for all potential cases, as it outputs the correct Pythagorean triple for each given input within the specified constraints.
