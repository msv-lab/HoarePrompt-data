The function `func` reads input for the number of trolleybuses, acceleration, and initial distance. Then, based on the given time intervals and velocities for each trolleybus, it calculates the total distance traveled by the trolleybus. If the number of trolleybuses is less than 1, the loop does not execute. The function calculates the maximum total distance traveled by the trolleybus considering the time intervals and velocities provided.
