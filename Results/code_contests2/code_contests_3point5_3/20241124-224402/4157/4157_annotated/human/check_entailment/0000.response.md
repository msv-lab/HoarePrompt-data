Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of trolleybuses, maximum acceleration, and distance to the final station.
2. It then iterates through each trolleybus, calculates the minimum time to reach the final station based on the provided formulas, and prints the result.
3. The logic within the for loop ensures that the trolleybuses do not overtake each other and arrive at the final station as quickly as possible.
4. The program follows the problem description and provides the expected output for the given examples.
5. There are no missing edge cases or logic issues identified, and the program seems to handle all potential scenarios as described in the problem statement.
