Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. The previous values of `t1`, `ti`, and `t` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `t`. `i` is increased by 1, and `n` is equal to or greater than the updated value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated to a new value, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is equal to or greater than the updated `i` value.
Output State: **`t` is updated to a new value, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is equal to or greater than the updated `i` value**
