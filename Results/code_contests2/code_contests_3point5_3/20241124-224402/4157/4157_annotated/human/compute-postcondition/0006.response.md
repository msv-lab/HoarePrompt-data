Example Answer:
The code prints the current value of `t`. The value of `t` is the maximum value between the calculation of `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`. Since the specific values of `t1`, `ti`, and the previous value of `t` are unknown, we cannot calculate the exact value of `t`. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is the maximum value between the calculation of `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between the calculation of `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`**
