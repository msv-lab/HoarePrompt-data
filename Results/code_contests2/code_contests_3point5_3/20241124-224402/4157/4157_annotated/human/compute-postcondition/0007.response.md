According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the maximum value between the calculation of `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is the maximum value between the calculation of `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1**
