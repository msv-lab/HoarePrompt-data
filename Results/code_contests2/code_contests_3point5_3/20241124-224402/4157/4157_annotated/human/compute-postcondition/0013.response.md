Example Answer: 
`ti` and `v` are assigned the values returned by `map(float, raw_input().split())`. As `raw_input()` is not a valid Python function, the code will result in an error. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`t` is updated to a new value and that value is printed, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is equal to or greater than the updated `i` value**
