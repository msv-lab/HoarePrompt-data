According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is updated to a new value, and that value is printed. To execute the loop one more time, the `i` should be increased by 1. 
State: **`t` is updated to a new value and that value is printed, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is equal to or greater than the updated `i` value**
