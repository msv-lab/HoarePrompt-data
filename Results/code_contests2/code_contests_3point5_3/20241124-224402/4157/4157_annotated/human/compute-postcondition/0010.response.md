Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to be the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `t` will be the maximum between the sum of `t1` and the new value of `i`, and the previous value of `t`. 
Output State: **`t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + (previous value of i + 1)` and the previous value of `t`**
