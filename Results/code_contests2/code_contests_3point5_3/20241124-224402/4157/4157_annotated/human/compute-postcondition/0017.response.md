According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is updated to a new value, `i` is increased by 1, and `n` is equal to or greater than the updated `i` value. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than the updated `n` value. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` should be greater than the updated value of `i`.
State: **`t` is updated to a new value, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the updated value of `i`**
