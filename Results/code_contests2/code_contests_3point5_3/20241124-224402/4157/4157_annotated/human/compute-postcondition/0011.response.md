Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + (previous value of i + 1)` and the previous value of `t`. Since the initial state of `t` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `t`. After the update, `t` will have a new value. The program then prints the updated value of `t`.
Output State: **`t` is updated to a new value, and that value is printed**
