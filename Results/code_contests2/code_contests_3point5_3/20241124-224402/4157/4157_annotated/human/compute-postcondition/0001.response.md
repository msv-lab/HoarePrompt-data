Example Answer:
The variables `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned values using the `map` function which converts the input values to integers. Since the previous value of `t` is 0.0 and it's not affected by the code, the output state is: `t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are input integers.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are input integers**
