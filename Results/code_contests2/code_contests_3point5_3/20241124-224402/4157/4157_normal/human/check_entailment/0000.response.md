Correctness: **True**

Upon initial assessment, the code seems to correctly calculate the arrival time for each trolleybus as described in the problem. The code reads the input values for the number of trolleybuses, maximum acceleration, and distance to the final station. It then iterates through each trolleybus, calculates the time value `t1` based on the input values, and updates the maximum time `t` accordingly. The code prints the updated `t` value after each iteration, which aligns with the requirement to print the time each trolleybus arrives at the final station.

The output hints also agree with the code, stating that the function reads input values for `n`, `a`, and `d`, iterates `n` times, calculates a time value `t1` for each trolleybus, and updates the maximum time `t`. The hints accurately describe the code's functionality, confirming that the program follows the problem description for all cases.

Therefore, based on the initial assessment and the agreement between the code and the output hints, the code is deemed correct.
