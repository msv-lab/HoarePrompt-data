Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `a`, and `d`, then iterates `n` times. For each iteration, it calculates a time value `t1` based on input values and updates `t` to the maximum between `t1 + ti` and the current `t`. The function prints the updated `t` value after each iteration. However, the annotation states that the function does not accept any parameters, which is inaccurate since it reads input values. Additionally, the annotation does not mention the import of the math module used in the code.**
