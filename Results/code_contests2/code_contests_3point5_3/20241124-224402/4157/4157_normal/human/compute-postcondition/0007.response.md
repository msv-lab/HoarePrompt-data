According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the maximum value between (calculated based on the formula using `a`, `d`, and `v`) and `t` + `ti`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are input integers, `i` is 0, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1 and ensure that `i` is less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is the maximum value between (calculated based on the formula using `a`, `d`, and `v`) and `t` + `ti`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are input integers, `i` is 1, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float**
