According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is the maximum value between (calculated based on the formula using `a`, `d`, and `v`) and `t` + `ti`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are input integers, `i` is 2, `ti` and `v` are input floats, `t1` is assigned the value calculated based on the provided formula using the input values `a`, `d`, and `v`.**
