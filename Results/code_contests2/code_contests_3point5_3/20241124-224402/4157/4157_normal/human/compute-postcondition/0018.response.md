Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between the calculated value using `a`, `d`, and `v` and `t` + `ti`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are input integers, `i` is the iteration number, `ti` and `v` are input floats, `t1` is calculated based on the formula using `a`, `d`, and `v`. The loop will not execute if `n` is 0 or negative.**
