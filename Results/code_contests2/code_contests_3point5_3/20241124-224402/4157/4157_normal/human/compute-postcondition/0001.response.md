Example Answer:
The variables `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned values by mapping the input to integers. The `raw_input().split()` function splits the input by spaces, and `map(int, ...)` maps the integer conversion to each split part. Since the initial state does not mention the input values, the output state will be: `t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are input integers.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are input integers**
