Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case when multiple trolleybuses catch up with each other and travel together to the final station. The program only calculates the arrival time for each trolleybus individually without considering the possibility of them traveling together after catching up. This violates the problem description, which states that trolleybuses cannot overtake each other and will travel together if one catches up with another.
