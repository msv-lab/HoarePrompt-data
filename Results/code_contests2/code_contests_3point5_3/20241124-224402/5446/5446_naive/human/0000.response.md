Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it is using variables `b` and `c` which are not defined in the input. The correct variables should be `a` and `b` according to the problem description. Additionally, the program is trying to read input using `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python. The correct way to read input in Python is using the `input()` function.
