Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the integer value from the input split. The value of `x` is the ratio between the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`. The code then prints the result of the calculation `int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x))`. Since `b`, `n`, and `x` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact output. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 100, 2 <= n <= a + b; n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values from the input split; `x` is the ratio between the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 100, 2 <= n <= a + b; n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values from the input split; `x` is the ratio between the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`**
