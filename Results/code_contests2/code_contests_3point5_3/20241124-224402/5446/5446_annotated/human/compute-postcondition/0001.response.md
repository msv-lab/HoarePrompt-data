Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the ratio between the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`. The values of `b` and `c` are assigned from the input split, so the value of `x` is calculated accordingly. 
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `n` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 100, 2 <= n <= a + b; n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values from the input split; `x` is the ratio between the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`**
