The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the result of the arithmetic expression a^n + b^n. The parameters a, b, and n are integers satisfying the constraints 1 <= a, b <= 100 and 2 <= n <= a + b. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return the result of the expression a^n + b^n, where a, b, and n are integers that meet the specified constraints.
