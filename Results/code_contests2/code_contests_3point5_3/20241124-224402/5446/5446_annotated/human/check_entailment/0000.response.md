Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes input for the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake. It then calculates the maximum number x such that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake. The program calculates this by finding the maximum number of pieces in the cakes, dividing it by the minimum number of pieces in the cakes, and then adjusting it based on the number of plates. The logic seems to correctly follow the problem description and should work for all potential cases.
