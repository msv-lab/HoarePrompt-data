Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is calculated by taking the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`. The initial states are 1 ≤ `b`, `c` ≤ 100. Therefore, the maximum value of `b` and `c` will be 100 and the minimum value will be 1. So, `x` will be 100.0. 
Output State: **`b` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `x` is 100.0**
