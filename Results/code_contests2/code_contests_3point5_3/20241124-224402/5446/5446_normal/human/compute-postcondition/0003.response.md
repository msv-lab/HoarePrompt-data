The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the sum of two integers `a` and `b`, and increments the sum `n` times. The function then returns the final sum after the increments. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the sum of `a` and `b`, increment it `n` times, and return the final sum. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of two integers `a` and `b`, increments it `n` times, and returns the final sum.**
