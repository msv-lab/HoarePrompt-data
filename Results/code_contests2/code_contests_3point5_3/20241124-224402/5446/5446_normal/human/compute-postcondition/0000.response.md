Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned by splitting the input string into integers. Based on the preconditions, `n` is an integer between 2 and a + b, and `b` and `c` are integers between 1 and 100. Therefore, the output state is: 1 ≤ `b`, `c` ≤ 100; 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`.
Output State: **1 ≤ `b`, `c` ≤ 100; 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`**
