Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program description states that each plate must contain at least one piece of cake, but the code does not ensure this. Additionally, the code seems to have a typo where `c` is used instead of `b` in the input reading line. This can lead to incorrect calculations.

Output hints: The output hints do not provide any specific cases where the code might fail to meet the problem requirements. However, they describe the code functionality accurately, but the code itself does not implement the conditions specified in the problem description.
