Correctness: False

The provided code does not produce the correct output for all potential cases. The calculation of x is incorrect, as it should be the minimum of a and b, rather than the maximum. Additionally, the use of `ceil` function without importing it can lead to errors. 

For example, for the input:
4 7 10

The expected output is 3, as the minimum number of pieces on the plate is 3. However, the code will output 2, which is incorrect.
