Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of size 1000000 with all elements set to True, `i` is 2, the loop sets elements in the list `a` to False at specific indices based on the value of `i`** 

In cases where `i` is such that `i ** 2 - 1` is greater than or equal to 1000000, the loop will not execute and the list `a` will remain unchanged.
