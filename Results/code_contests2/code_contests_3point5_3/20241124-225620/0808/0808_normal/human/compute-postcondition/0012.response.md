According to the code, the loop will only execute if `i` is equal to 2. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has not executed yet, so `i` is still 2. The loop will iterate over all multiples of 2 starting from 3 and set the corresponding index in list `a` to False. Since the loop has not executed yet, `a` will still be a list of size 1000000 with all elements set to True. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of size 1000000 with all elements set to True, `i` is 2**
