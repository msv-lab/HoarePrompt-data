According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as the range specified is valid, i.e., the starting point `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000. Before the loop starts, `n` is not directly related to the loop execution, so it does not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute as long as the starting point is valid and within the range of the list `a`. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `j` is `i ** 2 - 1`, and `a` is a list of size 1000000 with all elements set to True.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of size 1000000 with all elements set to True, `i` is 2, `j` is `i ** 2 - 1`**
