Example Answer:
The value of `j` is calculated to be the next value within the range starting from `i`. As `i` is 3, `j` would be 4. Therefore, the 4th element of list `a` is set to False. The initial state of `a` is a list of size 1000000 with all elements set to True except the 9th element which is False. After running the code, the 4th element is also set to False.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of size 1000000 with elements set to True except the 9th and 4th elements which are False, `i` is 3, `j` is 4**
