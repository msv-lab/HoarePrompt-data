Output State: **If i is 2, the loop will iterate over all multiples of 2 starting from 3 and set the corresponding index in list a to False. If i is not 2, the loop will not execute. After the loop executes, a is a list of size 1000000 with all elements set to True except for the elements at indices that are multiples of 2 which are False.**
