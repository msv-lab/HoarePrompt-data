Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of size 1000000 with all elements set to True. If `i` is 2, the loop will iterate over all multiples of 2 starting from 3 and set the corresponding index in list `a` to False. If `i` is not 2, the loop will not execute. After the loop executes, `a` will be a list of size 1000000 with all elements set to True except for the elements at indices that are multiples of 2 which are False.***
