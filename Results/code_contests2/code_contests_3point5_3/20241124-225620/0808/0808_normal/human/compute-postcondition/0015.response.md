According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and the element at index 2 in list `a` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than 1000000. The next value of `j` can be calculated as `i ** 2 - 1 + i`. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to `i ** 2 - 1 + i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of size 1000000 with all elements set to True, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and the element at index 2 in list `a` is False, `j` is i ** 2 - 1 + i**
