According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `j` is 4. Since the loop increments `j` by `i`, to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value after 4 when incremented by 3. So, `j` should be updated to 7 to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of size 1000000 with elements set to True except the 9th and 4th elements which are False, `i` is 3, `j` is 7**
