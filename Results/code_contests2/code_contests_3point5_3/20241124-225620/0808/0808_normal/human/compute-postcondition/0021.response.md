Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of size 1000000 with all elements set to True, `i` is 2. If the condition `a[i - 1]` is True, then for all indices `j` in the range from `i ** 2 - 1` to 1000000 with step size `i`, the elements at those indices in the list `a` are set to False.***
