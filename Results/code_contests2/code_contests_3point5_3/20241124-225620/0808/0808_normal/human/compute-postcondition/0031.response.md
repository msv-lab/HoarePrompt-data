Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of size 1000000 with elements set to True except for those at indices that are multiples of 3. If `n` is less than 3, no changes occur to the list `a`. Otherwise, the elements of `a` at indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 up to 999,996 are set to False due to the loop execution.***
