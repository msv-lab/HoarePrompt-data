Example Answer: 
A list `a` of size 1000000 is created with all elements set to `True`. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; a is a list of size 1000000 with all elements set to True.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; a is a list of size 1000000 with all elements set to True**
