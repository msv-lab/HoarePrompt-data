Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly reads an integer n and calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to n using the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. It iterates through all numbers up to n and marks the multiples of each number as non-prime. Finally, it counts the number of remaining prime numbers. The algorithm is efficient and accurate in counting prime numbers. Additionally, the program handles multiple datasets as stated in the problem description.
