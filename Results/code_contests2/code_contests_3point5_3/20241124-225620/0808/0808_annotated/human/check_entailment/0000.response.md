Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads an integer n and calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to n. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find prime numbers. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and for all possible input cases within the given constraints, the program should work correctly.
