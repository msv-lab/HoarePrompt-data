According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of 3 to 999,999. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999 and `i` is within the range of 3 to 999,999. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` does not need to be changed.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999 and i is within the range of 3 to 999,999**
