According to the code, the loop will execute as long as i is within the range of 2 to 999,999. Before the loop starts, n is an integer within that range ensures the loop will execute. The list a with 1000000 elements all set to True is not directly used in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999**
