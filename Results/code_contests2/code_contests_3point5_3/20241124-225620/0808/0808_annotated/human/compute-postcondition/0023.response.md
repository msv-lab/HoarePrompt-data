According to the code, the loop can execute if the range in the for loop is valid. This means that the starting point `(i ** 2 - 1)` must be less than 1000000, and the stepping value `i` cannot be zero. Additionally, the initial state before the loop starts should ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `i` is within the range of 3 to 999,999 and `(i ** 2 - 1)` is less than 1000000.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, i is within the range of 3 to 999,999, (i ** 2 - 1) is less than 1000000**
