According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `j` is within the range of `(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000)` and increments by `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `i` is within the range of 2 to 999,999, `j` is equal to `i + i`, value at index `i` in list `a` is True, value at index `j` in list `a` is False. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `j` should be within the range of `(i ** 2, 1000000)` instead of `(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000)`
- The value at index `j` in list `a` needs to be updated to True

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `i` is within the range of 2 to 999,999, `j` is equal to `i + i`, value at index `i` in list `a` is True, value at index `j` in list `a` is True**
