Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999 and i is within the range of 3 to 999,999. If i is outside the range of 3 to 999,999 or n is less than 1 or greater than 999,999, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, all elements in the array a with indices in the range of i are set to False.***
