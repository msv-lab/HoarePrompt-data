Example Answer:
The value of `a` at index `j` is assigned `False`. Variable `j` starts at the value of `i`, and `i` is within the range of 2 to 999,999. Therefore, after execution, the value at index `i` in list `a` will be `False`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `i` is within the range of 2 to 999,999, `j` starts at `i, value at index `i` in list `a` is False**
