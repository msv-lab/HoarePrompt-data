Example Answer:
`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`, but the previous values of `a` and `j` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `i` is within the range of 3 to 999,999, and `a[j]` is False.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `i` is within the range of 3 to 999,999, `a[j]` is False**
