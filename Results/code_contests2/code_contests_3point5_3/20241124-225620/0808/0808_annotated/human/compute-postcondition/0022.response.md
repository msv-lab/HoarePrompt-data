According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of i in the range from 2 to 999,999. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999 and i is within the range of 2 to 999,999. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of i should be incremented by 1. Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999 and i is within the range of 3 to 999,999**
