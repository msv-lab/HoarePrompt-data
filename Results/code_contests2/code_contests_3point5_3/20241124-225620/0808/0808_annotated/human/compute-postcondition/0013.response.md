According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as the range defined by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)` is not empty. For this range to be non-empty, the starting point `i ** 2 - 1` must be less than `1000000` and `i` must be a factor of `1000000`.

To adjust the state before the loop starts for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `i` is within the range of 2 to 999,999, `j` starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and `i` must be a factor of `1000000`**
