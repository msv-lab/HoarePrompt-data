According to the code, the loop will execute based on the input from sys.stdin. Since i is crucial for the loop to update elements in the array 'a', the state must ensure that i is within the range of 2 to 999,999. The loop will update elements in the array 'a' starting at index i^2 - 1 and incrementing by i until reaching 999,999. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999 and `i` is within the range of 2 to 999,999.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `i` is within the range of 2 to 999,999**
