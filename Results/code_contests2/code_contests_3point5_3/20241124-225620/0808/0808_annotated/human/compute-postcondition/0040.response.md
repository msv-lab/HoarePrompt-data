According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there is input coming from the standard input `sys.stdin`. Since we cannot determine the specific values of `n` and `i` from the given information, the loop will execute again regardless of the values of `n` and `i`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999 and n > i, `i` is within the range of 2 to 999,999**
