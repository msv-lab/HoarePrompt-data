Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999. If a[i - 1] is True, the program updates elements in the array a based on the loop condition. If i is 1, the loop does not execute. If i is within the specified range, the loop updates elements in array `a` based on the loop conditions. The program ensures that a[j] is set to False for values of j ranging from i^2 - 1 to 999,999 with a step size of i.***
