According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `i` is within the range of 2 to 999,999, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, value at index `i` in list `a` is True, value at index `j` in list `a` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the specified range `[i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i]`, so it should be adjusted to `j` equals `i + i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `i` is within the range of 2 to 999,999, `j` is equal to `i + i`, value at index `i` in list `a` is True, value at index `j` in list `a` is False**
