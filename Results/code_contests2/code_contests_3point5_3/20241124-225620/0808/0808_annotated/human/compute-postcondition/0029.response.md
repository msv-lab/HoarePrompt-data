According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of `i` and `j` is less than 1000000. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `i` is within the range of 3 to 999,999, and all `a[j]` are set to False where `j` is within the range of `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted such that it is within the range of `i` and less than 1000000. Since `j` is currently set to `i ** 2 - 1`, it needs to be adjusted to the next value within the range of `i` and less than 1000000. Therefore, `j` needs to be incremented by `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `i` is within the range of 3 to 999,999, all `a[j]` are set to False where `j` is within the range of `i`, `j` is within the range of `i` and less than 1000000**
