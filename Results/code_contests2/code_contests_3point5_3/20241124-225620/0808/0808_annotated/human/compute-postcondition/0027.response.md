According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `i` is within the range of 3 to 999,999, and `a[j]` is False where `j` is within the range of `i. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration, which is `(i ** 2 - 1) + i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `i` is within the range of 3 to 999,999, `a[j]` is False where `j` is within the range of `i, `j` is equal to `(i ** 2 - 1) + i`**
