According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list or array satisfying `a[i - 1]` evaluates to True, `i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ 999,999, `j` is initialized to `i`, and `a[j]` is set to False. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration's `j`. Since `j` is incremented by `i` in each iteration, we need to increase `j` by `i`.  
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list or array satisfying `a[i - 1]` evaluates to True, `i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ 999,999, `j` is updated to `j + i`, `a[j]` is set to False**
