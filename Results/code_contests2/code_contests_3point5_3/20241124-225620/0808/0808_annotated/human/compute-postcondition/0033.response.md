Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999. If i is within the range of 2 to 999,999, the loop updates elements in the array 'a' based on the loop conditions. For each index j starting at i^2 - 1 and incrementing by i until reaching 999,999, the values in list 'a' are set to False. If i is less than 2 or greater than 999,999, no changes occur in list 'a'.**
