Output State: **If `i` is 1, the loop will not execute as `j` starts at 0 which is less than `i ** 2 - 1`. In this case, `a` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 1, the loop will execute and set every `j`th element of `a` to False where `j` ranges from `i ** 2 - 1` to 999,999 with a step size of `i`.**
