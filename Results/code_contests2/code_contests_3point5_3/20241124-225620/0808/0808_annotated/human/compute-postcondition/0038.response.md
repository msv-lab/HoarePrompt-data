According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input from the `sys.stdin`. Since `sys.stdin` can potentially provide multiple inputs, the loop could execute multiple times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999 and n > i, `i` is within the range of 2 to 999,999. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999 and n > i, `i` is within the range of 2 to 999,999**
