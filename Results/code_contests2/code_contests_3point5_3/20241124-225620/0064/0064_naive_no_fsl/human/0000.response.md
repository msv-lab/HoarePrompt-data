Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the sum of the coins each player has at the end of the game and checks if the sum is divisible by the number of players. If the sum is not divisible or the sum is 0, it outputs -1 indicating that there is no possible initial bet that would lead to the given final coin amounts. The program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
