Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input of the number of coins each player has at the end of the game and calculates the sum of all coins. If the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of players, it outputs -1 indicating that there is no possible initial bet value. Otherwise, it calculates the initial bet value by dividing the total sum by the number of players and outputs it.

The program correctly follows the problem description and covers all potential cases as mentioned in the problem statement. For any valid input where a solution exists, the program provides the correct initial bet value.
