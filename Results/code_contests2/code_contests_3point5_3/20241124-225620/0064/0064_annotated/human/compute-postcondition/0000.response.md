Example Answer:
The code snippet `c = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user and splits it based on spaces, converting each part to an integer. The values of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are assigned to c as a list of integers. Since the initial state specifies that c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers in the range 0 to 100, the output state would be: c is a list of integers representing the input values.
Output State: **c is a list of integers representing the input values**
