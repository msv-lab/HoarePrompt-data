Example Answer: 
The sum of all integers in list `c` is calculated and stored in variable `s`. The values in list `c` are used for calculation, and after execution, the sum is stored in `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: c is a list of integers representing the input values, s is the sum of all integers in list c.
Output State: **c is a list of integers representing the input values, s is the sum of all integers in list c**
