Example Answer:
The code checks if the sum of all integers in list `c` is equal to 0 or not divisible by the length of the list `c`. If either condition is true, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the average of all integers in list `c`. The state of variables `c` and `s` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: c is a list of integers representing the input values, s is the sum of all integers in list c.
Output State: **c is a list of integers representing the input values, s is the sum of all integers in list c**
