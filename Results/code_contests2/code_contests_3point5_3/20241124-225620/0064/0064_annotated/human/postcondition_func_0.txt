The function `func` reads a sequence of integers from user input, calculates the sum of the integers, and prints either -1 if the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of integers in the sequence, or the average of the integers if the sum is divisible by the number of integers. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
