Example Answer: 
The values from the input are split and converted to integers using the map function. Since the initial state includes c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 as integers, after running the code, the values from the input will be assigned to c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers with values obtained from the input.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers with values obtained from the input**
