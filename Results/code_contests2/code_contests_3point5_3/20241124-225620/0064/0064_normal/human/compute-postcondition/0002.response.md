Example Answer:
The code first checks if the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 is equal to 0 or if it is not divisible by the length of the list. If any of these conditions are met, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of the division of the sum by the length of the list. The previous values of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are used to calculate the sum. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers with values obtained from the input, s is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers with values obtained from the input, s is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5**
