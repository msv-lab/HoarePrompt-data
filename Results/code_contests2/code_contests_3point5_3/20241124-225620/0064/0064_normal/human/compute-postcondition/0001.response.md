Example Answer:
The sum of the integers c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 is calculated and assigned to variable s. The values of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are obtained from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers with values obtained from the input, and s is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers with values obtained from the input, and s is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5**
