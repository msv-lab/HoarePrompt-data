Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads a line of integers from the input, calculates the sum of those integers, and then prints either -1 if the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of integers in the input, or the average of the integers if the sum is divisible by the count of integers. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly handles the case where the sum of the coins is zero, and in that case, it returns -1. Additionally, if the sum of coins is divisible by the count of players, it calculates the average number of coins each player initially bet and returns that value. The code does not miss any edge cases and follows the problem description for every potential case.
