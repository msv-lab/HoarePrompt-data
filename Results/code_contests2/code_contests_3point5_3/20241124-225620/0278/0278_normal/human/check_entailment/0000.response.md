Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code uses reduce and zip functions in a complex way that makes it difficult to track the actual logic. Furthermore, the output hints indicate that the code should print the minimum value obtained from the calculations, but the code directly prints a specific value without any calculations. This discrepancy between the description and the code indicates that the program is not correct.
