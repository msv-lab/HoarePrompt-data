Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes the input values for n, V, a, and b.
2. It then calculates the volume of soup that Volodya will cook by iterating through each ingredient, finding the minimum proportion of that ingredient available, and then multiplying it by the amount of that ingredient to get the maximum possible volume of soup that can be cooked with that ingredient.
3. Finally, it takes the minimum of all these calculated volumes and the limit V, ensuring that the final volume does not exceed the pan size.
4. The program outputs the correct volume of soup that Volodya will cook.
5. The code logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, making it correct.
