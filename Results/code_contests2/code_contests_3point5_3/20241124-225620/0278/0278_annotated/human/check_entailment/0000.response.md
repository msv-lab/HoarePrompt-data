Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input as described in the problem statement, calculates the volume of soup that Volodya will cook, and outputs the result with the required precision. The logic of the program seems to be correctly implemented based on the problem description. The code considers all the ingredients and their proportions to calculate the maximum volume of soup that can be cooked. Additionally, the program uses lambda functions and the reduce function to iterate over the ingredients and calculate the volume accordingly. The program has provided examples as well, and they seem to be producing the correct output. Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the correctness of the program is considered True.
