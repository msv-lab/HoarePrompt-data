You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's a very unfortunate day for Volodya today. He got bad mark in algebra and was therefore forced to do some work in the kitchen, namely to cook borscht (traditional Russian soup). This should also improve his algebra skills.

According to the borscht recipe it consists of n ingredients that have to be mixed in proportion <image> litres (thus, there should be a1 ·x, ..., an ·x litres of corresponding ingredients mixed for some non-negative x). In the kitchen Volodya found out that he has b1, ..., bn litres of these ingredients at his disposal correspondingly. In order to correct his algebra mistakes he ought to cook as much soup as possible in a V litres volume pan (which means the amount of soup cooked can be between 0 and V litres). What is the volume of borscht Volodya will cook ultimately?

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and V (1 ≤ n ≤ 20, 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000). The next line contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100). Finally, the last line contains n space-separated integers bi (0 ≤ bi ≤ 100).

Output

Your program should output just one real number — the volume of soup that Volodya will cook. Your answer must have a relative or absolute error less than 10 - 4.

    a, b = [float(i) for i in raw_input().split()], [float(i) for i in
    raw_input().split()]
    print(min(reduce(lambda ans, ai: ans + reduce(lambda minx, ab: min(minx, ab
    [0] / ab[1]), zip(b, a), 2.0 ** 30) * ai, a, 0), V))

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
