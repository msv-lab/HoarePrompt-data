Functionality: **The function reads integer inputs `n` and `V`, followed by two lists of floating-point numbers `a` and `b`. It then calculates and prints the minimum value obtained by multiplying each element in list `a` with the minimum division result from each pair of elements in lists `b` and `a`. The function also multiplies the calculated value with `ai` and sums them up, ensuring the total sum does not exceed `V`.**
