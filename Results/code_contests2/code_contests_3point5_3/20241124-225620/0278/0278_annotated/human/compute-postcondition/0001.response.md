Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned lists of floats converted from user input. The values of `n` and `V` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `V` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000, `ai` and `bi` are positive integers such that 1 <= ai <= 100 and 0 <= bi <= 100, `a` and `b` are lists of floats converted from user input.
Output State: **`n` and `V` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000, `ai` and `bi` are positive integers such that 1 <= ai <= 100 and 0 <= bi <= 100, `a` and `b` are lists of floats converted from user input**
