Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum perimeter that can be achieved based on the input number of city blocks. It covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program checks if the square of an integer is equal to the input N, and then calculates the perimeter accordingly. It also considers the condition when the product of x and x+1 is greater than N. The logic and calculations in the program are correct for all possible scenarios, hence the correctness of the program is true.
