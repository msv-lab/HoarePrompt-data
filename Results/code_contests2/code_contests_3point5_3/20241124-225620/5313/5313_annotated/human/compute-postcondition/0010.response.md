Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, x is the integer part of the square root of n. If x^2 is equal to n, then answr is 4 times the integer part of the square root of n. If x^2 is not equal to n, and x * (x + 1) is greater than n, then answr is (x + x + 1) * 2. If x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, then answr is 4 * (x + 1).***
