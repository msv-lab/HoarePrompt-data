Example Answer: 
`answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`, where `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`. Since `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, `answr` is calculated as `x * 4`. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, x is the integer part of the square root of n, x^2 is equal to n, and answr is 4 times the integer part of the square root of n.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, x is the integer part of the square root of n, x^2 is equal to n, and answr is 4 times the integer part of the square root of n**
