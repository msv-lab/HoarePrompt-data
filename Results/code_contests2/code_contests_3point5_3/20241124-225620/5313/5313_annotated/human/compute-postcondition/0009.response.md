Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, but x^2 is not equal to `n`. If the product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `n`, then `answr` is calculated as (x + x + 1) * 2. If x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, then `answr` is calculated as 4 * (x + 1).***
