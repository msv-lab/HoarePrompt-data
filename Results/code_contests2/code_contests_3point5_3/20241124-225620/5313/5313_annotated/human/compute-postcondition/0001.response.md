Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the square root of `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` can be any positive integer between 1 and 10^6, the value of `x` will be the integer part of the square root of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, x is the integer part of the square root of n.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, x is the integer part of the square root of n**
