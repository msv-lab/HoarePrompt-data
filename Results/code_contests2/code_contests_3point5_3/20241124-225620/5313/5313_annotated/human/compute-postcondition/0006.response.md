Example Answer:
The value of `answr` is calculated as the product of `x + x + 1` and 2. As given, `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, and the product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `n`. Therefore, the product of `x + x + 1` and 2 is greater than `n`. The variable `answr` stores this calculated value.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, but x^2 is not equal to `n`, the product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `n`, `answr` is the calculated value**
