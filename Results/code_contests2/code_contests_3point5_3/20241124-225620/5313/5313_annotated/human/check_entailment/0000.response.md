Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes an integer input N and calculates the minimum perimeter required to enclose exactly N city blocks in a square grid pattern. The program correctly calculates the perimeter based on the provided problem description. It checks if the square root of N is an integer, if so, it calculates the perimeter accordingly. Otherwise, it calculates the perimeter based on whether x(x+1) is greater than N or not. The logic provided covers all the possible scenarios and the program produces the expected output for all test cases.
