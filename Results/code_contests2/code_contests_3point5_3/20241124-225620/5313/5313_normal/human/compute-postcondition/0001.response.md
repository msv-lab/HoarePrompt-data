Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the square root of `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^6, the square root of `n` will also be a positive integer. Therefore, after execution, `x` will be the integer square root of `n`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`**
