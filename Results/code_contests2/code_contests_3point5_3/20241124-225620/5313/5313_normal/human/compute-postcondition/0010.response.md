Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`. If the square of `x` is equal to `n`, then `answr` is 4 times the square root of `n`. If the product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `n`, `answr` is calculated as `(x + x + 1) * 2`. If the product of `x` and `x+1` is less than or equal to `n`, `answr` is 4 times the value of `x + 1`. Ensure to consider all possible edge cases within the given constraints.***
