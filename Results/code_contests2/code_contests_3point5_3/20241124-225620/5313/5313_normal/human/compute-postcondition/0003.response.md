Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`, where `x` is the integer square root of `n`. Since the square of `x` is equal to `n`, `x` is the square root of `n`, and `answr` is `x * 4`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, the square of `x` is equal to `n`, and `answr` is 4 times the square root of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, the square of `x` is equal to `n`, and `answr` is 4 times the square root of `n`**
