Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum perimeter that can be achieved to enclose exactly N city blocks as described in the problem. The program first calculates the integer square root of N and then based on different conditions, computes the value of `answr` as per the problem description. 

The code checks if the square of the integer square root is equal to N, in which case it sets `answr` to `4 * x`. If the product of x and x+1 is greater than N, it calculates `answr` as `(x + x + 1) * 2`. If the product of x and x+1 is less than or equal to N, it sets `answr` to `4 * (x + 1) as required.

The code operates within the constraints provided in the problem description (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6) and provides the correct output for all valid cases. The output hints also align with the logic implemented in the code, further confirming its correctness. Hence, the code follows the problem description for every potential case.
