The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the integer square root `x` of `n`, and then based on different conditions, computes the value of `answr`. If the square of `x` is equal to `n`, `answr` is set to `4 * x`. If the product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `n`, `answr` is calculated as `(x + x + 1) * 2`. If the product of `x` and `x+1` is less than or equal to `n`, `answr` is set to `4 * (x + 1)`. The final integer value of `answr` is printed. The function operates under the constraint that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
