Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly set the levels to the passages as required by the problem description. The logic used in the program does not guarantee that the number of times we pass through a passage when leaving a room and getting back to it is always even. 

For example, when N=3, the output of the program is:
```
1 2
1
```
This does not satisfy the condition mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
