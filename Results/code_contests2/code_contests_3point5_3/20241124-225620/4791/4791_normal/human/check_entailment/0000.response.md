Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The program does not have a proper termination condition for the while loop which may lead to an infinite loop.
- The code does not handle input validation and type conversion for `n`.
- The output hints do not match with the code provided, as they describe a different logic than what the code is actually doing.
- The code does not follow the problem description as it does not set levels for the passages as required by the given conditions.
