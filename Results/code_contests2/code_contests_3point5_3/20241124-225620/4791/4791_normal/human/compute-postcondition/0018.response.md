According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 3. Since `j` is less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 4, the code prints 1**
