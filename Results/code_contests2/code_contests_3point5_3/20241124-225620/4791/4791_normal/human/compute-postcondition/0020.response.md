According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop calculated the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to n. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The loop calculated the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to n, where n is greater than 1**
