Example Answer:
The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is initially greater than 0, after decrementing, it will still be greater than 0. Therefore, the rightmost set bit position calculation will continue for the next iteration. 
Output State: **The loop continues calculating the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to n, where n is greater than 0**
