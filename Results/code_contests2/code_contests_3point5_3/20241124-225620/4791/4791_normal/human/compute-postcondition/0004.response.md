According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 0 and `j` is 0. Since `n` being at least 0 does not ensure the loop will execute again, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is at least 0, `j` is 1**
