Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of (j + 1). Since j is 1, (j + 1) is 2, which in binary is 10. The rightmost set bit is at position 2 (from the right), so the code snippet outputs 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, the code snippet outputs 2**
