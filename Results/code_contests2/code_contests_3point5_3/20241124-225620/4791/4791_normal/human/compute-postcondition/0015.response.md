Example Answer:
The code calculates the binary representation of `j + 1`, reverses it, finds the position of the first '1' in the reversed binary representation, and adds 1 to it. 
`j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3, which is '11' in binary. Reversing it gives '11', and the position of the first '1' is 1. Adding 1 to it gives 2.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, the code prints 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, the code prints 2**
