According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than 0 and j is 1. To execute the loop one more time, j needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **n is greater than 0, j is 2**
