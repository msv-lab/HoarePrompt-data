According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. `n` being greater than 0 ensures that the loop will execute at least one more time, so no need to adjust it. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **n is greater than 0, j is 1**
