Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of (j + 1). Since j is 2, (j + 1) is 3, which in binary is 11. The rightmost set bit is at position 0 from the right, so the code outputs 1. The variables n and j remain unaffected.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, j is 2**. The code outputs 1.
