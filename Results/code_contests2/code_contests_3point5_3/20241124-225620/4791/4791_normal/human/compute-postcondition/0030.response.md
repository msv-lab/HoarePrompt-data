According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. After each iteration, the program prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted so that it is still greater than 0 after the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **No adjustments needed as long as n is greater than 0**
