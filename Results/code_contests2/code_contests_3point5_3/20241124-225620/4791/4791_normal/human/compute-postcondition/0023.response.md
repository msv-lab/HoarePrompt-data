Example Answer: 
The code calculates the index of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j + 1. Since j is 0, j + 1 is 1, and its binary representation is '1'. The rightmost set bit is at index 0. Therefore, the output state is n is greater than 0, j is 0.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, j is 0**
