According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a decreased input value does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 0 and `j` is now 0.
State: **`n` is at least 0, `j` is 0**
