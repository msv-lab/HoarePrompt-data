According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1. Since `j` is less than `n` and the code snippet outputs 2, it means the loop executed at least one more time. So the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
