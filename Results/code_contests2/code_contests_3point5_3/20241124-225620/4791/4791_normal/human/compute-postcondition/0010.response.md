According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `n` is non-zero. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The loop calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to n and n is greater than 0**
