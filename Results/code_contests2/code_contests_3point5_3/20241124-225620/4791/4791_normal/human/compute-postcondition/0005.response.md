Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` is 2, which in binary is '10'. The rightmost '1' bit is at position 2 (0-indexed), so the output is 2.
Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `j` is 1. The output is 2**
