Example Answer: 
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. 
- `j` is 3, so `j + 1` is 4, which in binary is 100. 
- Reversing the binary representation gives 001. 
- The rightmost set bit is at position 1 (from the right), so the code prints 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, the code prints 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, the code prints 1**
