Functionality: **The function reads an input value `n`, decrements `n` in a loop until `n` is 0, and then for each iteration, it prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, it should be noted that the code snippet provided is incomplete as it lacks a clear termination condition for the `while` loop. Additionally, the lack of input validation and type conversion for `n` could lead to unexpected behavior.**
