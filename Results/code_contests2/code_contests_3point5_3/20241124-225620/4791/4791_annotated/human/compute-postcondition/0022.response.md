According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `n` is updated to `n-1` before the loop starts, it implies that `n` was originally at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` should be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` should be 0.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0**
