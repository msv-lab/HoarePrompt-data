Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of (j + 1). Since j is 0, j + 1 is 1. The binary representation of 1 is 1. The rightmost set bit is at position 0. Therefore, the output state is: n is greater than or equal to 1, j is 0.
Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 1, j is 0**
