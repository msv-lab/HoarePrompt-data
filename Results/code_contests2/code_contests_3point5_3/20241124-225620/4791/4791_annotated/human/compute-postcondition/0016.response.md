According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1. To execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 2 so that `j` can be greater than 1 and the loop can continue.
State: **`n` is greater than 2**
