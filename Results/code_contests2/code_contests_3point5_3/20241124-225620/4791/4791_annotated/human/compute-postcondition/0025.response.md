Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` is 2, which in binary is `10`. The rightmost set bit is at position 2 (from right to left). Therefore, the output state is `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and the function prints 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and the function prints 2**
