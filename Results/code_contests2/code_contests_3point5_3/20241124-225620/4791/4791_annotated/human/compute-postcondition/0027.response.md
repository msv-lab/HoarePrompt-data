Example Answer:
The code calculates `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. 
`j + 1` is 3, `bin(3)` is '0b11', `[::-1]` reverses the string to '11', `find('1')` finds the first occurrence of '1' which is at index 0, and then `+ 1` is added to get 1. 
Therefore, the function prints 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, the function prints 2**
