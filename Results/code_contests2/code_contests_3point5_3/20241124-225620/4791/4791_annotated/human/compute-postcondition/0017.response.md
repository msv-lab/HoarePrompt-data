Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of the number `j + 1`. Since `n` is greater than 2, `j` is assumed to be greater than or equal to 1. The binary representation of `j + 1` is used to find the position of the rightmost set bit (1-indexed). The result is then printed. The state of variable `n` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2**
