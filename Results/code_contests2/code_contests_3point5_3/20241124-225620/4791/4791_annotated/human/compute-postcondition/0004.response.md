According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0, and the function returns 1. Since `n` being greater than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the function returns 1**
