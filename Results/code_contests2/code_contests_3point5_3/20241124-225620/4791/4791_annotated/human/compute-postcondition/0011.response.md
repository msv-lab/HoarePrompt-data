Example Answer:
The value of `n` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, where `n` initially holds a value greater than 0. The loop will continue until `n` becomes 0. The program prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to the initial value of `n`. As `n` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, the loop will print the positions of the rightmost set bits for numbers from 1 to the initial value of `n`. 
Output State: **The loop prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to n where n is greater than 0**
