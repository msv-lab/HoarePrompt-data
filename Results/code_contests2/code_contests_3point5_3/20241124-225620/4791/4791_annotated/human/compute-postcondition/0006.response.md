According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the function returns 1. Since `j` is less than `n`, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the function returns 1**
