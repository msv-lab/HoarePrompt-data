According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is greater than or equal to 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is the input provided by the user minus 1. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and `j` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0**
