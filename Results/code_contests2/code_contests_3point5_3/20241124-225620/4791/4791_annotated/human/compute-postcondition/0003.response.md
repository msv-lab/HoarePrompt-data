Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the least significant bit that is set to 1 in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Here, `j` is 0, so `j + 1` is 1. The binary representation of 1 is '1', and the least significant bit set to 1 is at position 0 (from right to left). Therefore, the output state is `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0, and the function returns 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0, and the function returns 1**
