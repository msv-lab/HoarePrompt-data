According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and the function prints 2. Since `j` is 2, it must be adjusted to be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 2, the function prints 2**
