Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. The value of `j` is 1, so `j + 1` is 2. Converting 2 to binary gives '10', and finding the rightmost set bit gives '1' at position 1. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the function returns 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the function returns 1**
