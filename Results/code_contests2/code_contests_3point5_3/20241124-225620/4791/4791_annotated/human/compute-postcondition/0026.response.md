According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1. Since `j` is less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, the function prints 2**
