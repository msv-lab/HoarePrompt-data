According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0**
