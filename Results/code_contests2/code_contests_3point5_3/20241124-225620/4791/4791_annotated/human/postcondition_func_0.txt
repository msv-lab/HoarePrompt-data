The function takes user input for variable `n`, decrements `n` in a loop, and for each value of `n`, it prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to `n`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute. There is a missing aspect in the code as the input method is not specified, and the loop logic seems to be incorrect as it may lead to an infinite loop due to the condition `while n`.
