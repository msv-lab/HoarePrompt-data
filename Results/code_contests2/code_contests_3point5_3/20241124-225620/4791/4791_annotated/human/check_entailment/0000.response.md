Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. It does not set levels to the passages as required, instead, it prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to n. This logic is not related to the problem description of setting levels for passages in AtCoder's head office. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
