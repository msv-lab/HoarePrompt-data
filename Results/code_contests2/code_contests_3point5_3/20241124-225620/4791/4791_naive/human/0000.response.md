Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly set levels to the passages as required by the problem description. The logic in the program is not handling the condition where the number of times we pass through a passage when leaving a room, passing through some passages whose levels are all equal, and getting back to the same room should always be even. The program is simply printing the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of the loop variable, which does not satisfy the given conditions of the problem.
