Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program is attempting to check if a string is a palindrome, which is not the same as finding the n-th even-length palindrome number. Additionally, the program seems to be attempting to convert alphabetic characters to lowercase, which is not needed for this problem. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
