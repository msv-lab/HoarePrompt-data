Example Answer:
The list comprehension iterates over each character in the string `n`, converts it to lowercase if it is an alphabet character, and then joins all the processed characters back together. The updated value of `x` will be the string `n` with all alphabet characters converted to lowercase. The original value of `n` is unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a string containing alphanumeric characters, `x` is a string with all alphabet characters converted to lowercase**
