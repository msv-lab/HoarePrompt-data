Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly solve the problem description. The code only checks if the input string is a palindrome after converting it to lowercase and removing non-alphabetic characters. However, the problem description is asking for the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, which is not the same as checking if a given string is a palindrome. The code is not handling the logic to generate the n-th even-length positive palindrome number. Therefore, the code is incorrect for this problem.
