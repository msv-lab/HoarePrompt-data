Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input, splits the values, calculates the minimum and maximum values, and then calculates the absolute difference between them, which represents the minimum distance to be traveled. The logic seems to be correct and is in line with the problem description. The program should work for all potential cases within the given constraints.
