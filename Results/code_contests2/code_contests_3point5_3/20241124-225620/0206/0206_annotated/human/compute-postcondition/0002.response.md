Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`. The values in list `a` represent the coordinates of the houses on TopCoDeer street. The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 1000. Therefore, the absolute difference between these values is 1000. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **N is a positive integer representing the number of houses along TopCoDeer street, a_i is an integer representing the coordinate of the i-th house, where 0 <= a_i <= 1000. `a` is a list containing the input values split by spaces, `ans` is 1000**
