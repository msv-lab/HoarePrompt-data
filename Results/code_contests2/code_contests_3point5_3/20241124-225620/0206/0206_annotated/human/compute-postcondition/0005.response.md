Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values, calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the input list, and prints the result. The code does not actually calculate the distance between houses along TopCoDeer street as mentioned in the annotations. Additionally, the function does not accept any parameters, contrary to the annotation that suggests it does.**
