Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because:
1. The `np` module is not imported in the code, so `np.abs`, `np.max`, and `np.min` will result in errors.
2. The program reads the input incorrectly, as it uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python. It should use `input()` instead.
3. The program does not calculate the minimum distance correctly. It simply calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list, which is not the correct approach to find the minimum distance to be traveled. 

Overall, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
