Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code reads the input as strings and does not convert them to integers, which will cause issues when calculating the maximum and minimum values. Additionally, the code uses `np.max` and `np.min` on a list of strings, which will not give the correct maximum and minimum values. The code needs to be modified to convert the input values to integers before performing the calculations.
