Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `ans`, which represents the absolute difference between the farthest and nearest houses on TopCoDeer street. The initial state includes `N`, a positive integer representing the number of houses, and `a_i`, the coordinate of each house. The calculation for `ans` involves finding the maximum and minimum coordinates among all houses and calculating the absolute difference between them. The code does not modify the initial state variables. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer representing the number of houses on TopCoDeer street, a_i is an integer representing the coordinate of the i-th house, ans is the absolute difference between the farthest and nearest houses on the street.
Output State: **N is a positive integer representing the number of houses on TopCoDeer street, a_i is an integer representing the coordinate of the i-th house, ans is the absolute difference between the farthest and nearest houses on the street**
