Functionality: ** The function reads input from the user, specifically the number of houses on TopCoDeer street and the coordinates of each house. It then calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates of the houses and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, contrary to the annotation that mentions reading input. **
