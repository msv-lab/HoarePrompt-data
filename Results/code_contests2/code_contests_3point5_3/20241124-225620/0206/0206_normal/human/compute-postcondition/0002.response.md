Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array `a`. The array `a` contains the coordinates of the houses on TopCoDeer street. After execution, `ans` will hold the absolute difference between the farthest and nearest houses on the street.
Output State: **N is a positive integer representing the number of houses on TopCoDeer street, a_i is an integer representing the coordinate of the i-th house, where 1 ≤ i ≤ N; ans is the absolute difference between the farthest and nearest houses on the street**
