Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the least super lucky number that is not less than n. It iterates through all possible combinations of 4s and 7s, checking if the count of 4s is equal to the count of 7s and finding the minimum super lucky number that is greater than or equal to n. The logic of the program seems sound and covers all potential cases as per the problem description.
