Example Answer: 
The variable `tem` is assigned the integer value of `x` after joining the characters. The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, so the integer value of `x` can be determined. The length of the string representation of `n` is stored in `l`, and `ans` is adjusted according to the initial state of the loop. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is adjusted according to the initial state of the loop, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is the integer value of `x`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is adjusted according to the initial state of the loop, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is the integer value of `x`**
