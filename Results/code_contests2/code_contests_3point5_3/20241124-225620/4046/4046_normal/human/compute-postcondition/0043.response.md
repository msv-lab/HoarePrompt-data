According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `i`. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0, l is less than 10, n is a positive integer greater than 0, i is incremented by 1. If the counts of '7' and '4' in x are equal, the integer representation of x (tem) is calculated and compared with n. If tem is greater than or equal to n, ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and tem. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows: 
State: **total is 0, l is less than 10, n is a positive integer greater than 0, i is incremented by 1, x should be a product of '74' with a repeat value of i+1**
