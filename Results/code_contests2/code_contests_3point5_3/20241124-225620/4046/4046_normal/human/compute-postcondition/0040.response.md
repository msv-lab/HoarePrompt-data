Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The value of `tem` is the integer representation of the string `x`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: total is 0, l is less than 10, n is a positive integer greater than 0, i is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and the integer representation of the string `x`.
Output State: **total is 0, l is less than 10, n is a positive integer greater than 0, i is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and the integer representation of the string `x`**
