According to the code, the loop can execute again if the integer value of `tem` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is adjusted according to the initial state of the loop, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is the integer value of `x`. If the integer value of `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. The count of '7' in `x` must be equal to the count of '4' in `x` for the next iteration to occur.
2. The integer value of `tem` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is adjusted according to the initial state of the loop, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is the integer value of `x` and `tem` is less than `n`.**
