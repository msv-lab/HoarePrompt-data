According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is a non-negative integer. Since `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we can assume it needs to be a non-negative integer for the loop to execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `l` is less than 10, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `i` is a non-negative integer.
State: **`l` is less than 10, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer**
