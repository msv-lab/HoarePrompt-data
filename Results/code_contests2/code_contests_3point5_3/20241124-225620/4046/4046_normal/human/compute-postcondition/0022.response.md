Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is adjusted according to the initial state of the loop, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of `x`, `tem` is less than `n`, and if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, the integer value of `x` is calculated and stored in `tem`, `i` is incremented. After the execution of the if statement, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the concatenated string `x`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `tem`.***
