Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`. The value of `ans` may change based on the comparison with `tem`. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`l` is less than 10, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is the next incremented non-negative integer, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of `x` after joining its elements, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of the current `ans` value and `tem`**
