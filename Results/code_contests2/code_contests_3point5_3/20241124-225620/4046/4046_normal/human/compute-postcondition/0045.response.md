According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l`, `n`, and `i`. If `l` is less than 10 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if l is not less than 10 or n is not a positive integer greater than 0, the loop didn't execute. So for the loop to be executed one more time, both `l` should be less than 10 and `n` should be a positive integer greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`l` is less than 10, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0**
