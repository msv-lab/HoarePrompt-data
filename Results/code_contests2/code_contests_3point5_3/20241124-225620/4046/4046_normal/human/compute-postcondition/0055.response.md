Example Answer: 
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of the current `ans` value and `tem`. The value of `tem` is the integer value of `x` after joining its elements. The conditions on `l`, `n`, `i`, and the count of '7' and '4' in `x` are not specified, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is less than 10, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is the incremented non-negative integer, count of '7' in x is equal to count of '4' in x, `tem` is the integer value of `x` after joining its elements, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of the current `ans` value and `tem`.
Output State: **`l` is less than 10, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is the incremented non-negative integer, count of '7' in x is equal to count of '4' in x, `tem` is the integer value of `x` after joining its elements, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of the current `ans` value and `tem`**
