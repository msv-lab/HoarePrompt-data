According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute for all possible combinations of '74' with a length of `i`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `i` can be any positive integer value. Before the loop starts, `l` is adjusted based on the length of the string representation of n means that it should be equal to the length of the string representation of n. Considering `ans` is 4444477777, it needs to be adjusted to reflect the initial state where the loop executes at the starting point of all possible combinations of '74' of length i. 
State: **n is a positive integer, l is equal to the length of the string representation of n, ans is adjusted according to the initial state of the loop**
