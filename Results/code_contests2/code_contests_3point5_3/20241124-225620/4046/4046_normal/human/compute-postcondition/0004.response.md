Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of n + 1, and `ans` is 4444477777. After the execution of the if-else block, if the length of the string representation of n is odd, then `l` is incremented by 1. In all other cases, `l` remains the same. `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777.***
