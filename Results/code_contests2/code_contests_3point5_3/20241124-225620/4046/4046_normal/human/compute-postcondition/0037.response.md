Postcondition: ***total is 0, l is less than 10, n is a positive integer greater than 0, i is defined and used in the product function, i is incremented by 1. If the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, then tem is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of list x. If tem is greater than or equal to n, ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and tem.***
