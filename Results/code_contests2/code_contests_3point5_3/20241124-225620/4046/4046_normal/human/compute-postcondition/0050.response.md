Example Answer: 
The minimum value between `ans` and `tem` is assigned to `ans`. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is less than 10, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer. The count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, `tem` is the integer value of `x` after joining its elements. The value of `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
