Postcondition: ***total is 0, l is less than 10, n is a positive integer greater than 0, i is incremented by 1. If the counts of '7' and '4' in x are equal, the integer representation of x (tem) is calculated and compared with n. If tem is greater than or equal to n, ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and tem.***
