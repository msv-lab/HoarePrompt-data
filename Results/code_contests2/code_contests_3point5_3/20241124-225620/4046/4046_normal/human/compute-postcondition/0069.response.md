Functionality: **The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` from the user input and calculates the minimum integer value that meets certain conditions involving '7' and '4' strings. The function then prints this minimum value as the output. If `n` is 0 or the length of the string representation of `n` is greater than or equal to 10, the loop does not execute, and the output remains as 4444477777.**
