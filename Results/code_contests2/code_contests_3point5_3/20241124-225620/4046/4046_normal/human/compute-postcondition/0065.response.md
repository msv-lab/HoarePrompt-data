According to the code, the loop can execute again if `l` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is less than 10 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `l` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 10. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `l` is greater than or equal to 10 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0**
