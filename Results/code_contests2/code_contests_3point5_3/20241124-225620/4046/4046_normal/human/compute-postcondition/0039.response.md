Example Answer:
The string x is converted to an integer and assigned to tem. The previous values of total, l, n, and i are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: total is 0, l is less than 10, n is a positive integer greater than 0, i is incremented by 1, and tem is the integer representation of the string x.
Output State: **total is 0, l is less than 10, n is a positive integer greater than 0, i is incremented by 1, tem is the integer representation of the string x**
