Example Answer:
The length of the string representation of `n` is calculated and stored in `l`. The value of `ans` is assigned as 4444477777. Since `n` is a positive integer, the length of its string representation will be greater than 0. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of n, `ans` is 4444477777.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of n, `ans` is 4444477777**
