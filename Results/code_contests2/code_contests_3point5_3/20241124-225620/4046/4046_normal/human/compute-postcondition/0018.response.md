According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `i`. If `i` allows for another iteration, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is adjusted according to the initial state of the loop, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of `x`, `tem` is less than `n`, and if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, the integer value of `x` is calculated and stored in `tem`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be incremented. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is adjusted according to the initial state of the loop, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of `x`, `tem` is less than `n`, and if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, the integer value of `x` is calculated and stored in `tem`, `i` is incremented**
