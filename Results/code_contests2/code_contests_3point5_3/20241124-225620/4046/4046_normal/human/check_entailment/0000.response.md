Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The program description specifies that the output should be the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to n. However, the code does not handle the case when the input number n is itself a super lucky number. 

For example, if the input is 47, the code will output a number greater than 47 (e.g., 74) instead of the input number itself. This deviation from the problem description makes the code incorrect.
