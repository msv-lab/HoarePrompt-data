Correctness: False

The provided program does not always produce the correct output based on the problem description. It fails to handle cases where the input number `n` is a super lucky number itself. In such cases, the program should output the input number itself as it is the least super lucky number that is not less than `n`. However, the program does not account for this scenario.

For example:
Input
```
4747
```

Expected Output
```
4747
```

Actual Output
```
4444477777
```

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description.
