Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `tem`, `l` is an even length, `ans` is either the updated minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is the updated next even number greater than the current `i` value and is the length of the string '74' repeated i times, and `tem` is an integer value based on the conditions in the code. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`.***
