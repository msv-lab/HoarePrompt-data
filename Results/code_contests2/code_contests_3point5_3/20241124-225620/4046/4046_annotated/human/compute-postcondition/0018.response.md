According to the code, the loop will execute again if the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4'. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is the minimum value between 4444477777 and tem, i is a positive integer, tem is greater than or equal to n. If the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4', then tem is set to the integer value of x. If tem is greater than or equal to n, ans is updated to the minimum value between the current ans and tem.

For the loop to be executed one more time, the count of '7' in x must be equal to the count of '4'. Hence, the count of '7' and '4' in x need to be adjusted accordingly to satisfy this condition.

State: **n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is the minimum value between 4444477777 and tem, i is a positive integer, tem is greater than or equal to n, count of '7' in x is equal to count of '4'**
