According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `i` is the length of the string '74' repeated i times. Therefore, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the updated next even number `i`, `l` is an even length, `ans` is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, `i` is the updated next even number greater than the current `i` value and is the length of the string '74' repeated i times, and `tem` is an integer value based on the conditions in the code**
