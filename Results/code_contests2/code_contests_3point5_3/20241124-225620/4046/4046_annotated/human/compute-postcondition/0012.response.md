Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is 4444477777, i is a positive integer. If the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, then tem is set to the integer value represented by x. If tem is greater than or equal to n, then ans is updated to the minimum value between the current ans and tem.***
