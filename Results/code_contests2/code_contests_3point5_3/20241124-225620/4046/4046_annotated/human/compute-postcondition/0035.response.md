Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum between the current `ans` value and `tem`. The value of `ans` can either remain as 4444477777 or be updated to a new minimum value. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, i is the updated next even number greater than the current i value, and tem is an integer value obtained by converting the string x to an integer.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, i is the updated next even number greater than the current i value, and tem is an integer value obtained by converting the string x to an integer**
