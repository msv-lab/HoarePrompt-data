Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the updated value of tem, i is a positive integer, tem is greater than or equal to n, count of '7' in x is equal to count of '4'. After the execution of the if statement, ans will be updated to the minimum value between the current ans and tem, ensuring that it remains within the range of 4444477777 and the updated value of tem. All other variables maintain their initial conditions as stated in the precondition. The if statement handles the case where the count of '7' is equal to the count of '4' in x, then the string x is converted to an integer tem. If tem is greater than or equal to n, ans is updated to the minimum of the current ans and tem. This ensures that the final value of ans remains within the range of 4444477777 and the updated value of tem. All other variables maintain their initial conditions as described in the precondition, including the even length of l and the count of '7' being equal to the count of '4' in x.***
