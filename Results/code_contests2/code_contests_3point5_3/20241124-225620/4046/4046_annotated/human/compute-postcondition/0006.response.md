According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`, which is not explicitly given in the initial state. The loop will execute as long as `i` is a positive integer. Additionally, the loop will iterate over the product of '74' with a repeat of `i`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even length, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is a positive integer**
