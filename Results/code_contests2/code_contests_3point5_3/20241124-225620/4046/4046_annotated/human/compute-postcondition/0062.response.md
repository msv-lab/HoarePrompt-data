Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than the updated next even number `i`, `l` is an even length, `ans` is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, `i` is the updated next even number greater than the current `i` value and is the length of the string '74' repeated i times, and `tem` is an integer value based on the conditions in the code. If the count of '7's in string `x` is equal to the count of '4's, `tem` is set to the integer value of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to hold the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. This ensures that `ans` stores the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios considering the preconditions and ensures that `ans` holds the appropriate minimum value.***
