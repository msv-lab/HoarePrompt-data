Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the updated value of tem, i is a positive integer, tem is greater than or equal to n, count of '7' in x is equal to count of '4'. After the execution of the if statement, ans will be updated to the minimum value between the current ans and tem, ensuring that it remains within the range of 4444477777 and the updated value of tem. All other variables maintain their initial conditions as stated in the precondition.***
