According to the code, the loop can execute again if the next even number `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than the updated next even number `i`, `l` is an even length, `ans` is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, `i` is the updated next even number greater than the current `i` value and is the length of the string '74' repeated i times, and `tem` is an integer value based on the conditions in the code. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
- Update `n` to be greater than the next even number `i`
- Update `i` to the next even number greater than the current `i` value
- Update `tem` based on the conditions in the code

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the updated next even number `i`, `l` is an even length, `ans` is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, `i` is the updated next even number greater than the current `i` value and is the length of the string '74' repeated i times, and `tem` is an integer value based on the conditions in the code**
