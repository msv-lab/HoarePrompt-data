Output State: **If the loop executes, ans will be updated to the minimum value between the current ans and the integer value represented by x, where the count of '7' is equal to the count of '4' in x and if that value is greater than or equal to n. The loop will not execute if the condition is not met, and the variables will maintain their initial values. n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, i is a positive integer.**
