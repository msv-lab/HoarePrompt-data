According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the conditions mentioned in the loop body. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are known:
- n is a positive integer
- l is an even length
- ans is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value
- i is the next even number greater than the current i value
- tem is an integer value obtained by converting the string x to an integer, based on certain conditions

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of i needs to be updated to the next even number greater than the current i value.

State: **n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, i is the updated next even number greater than the current i value, and tem is an integer value obtained by converting the string x to an integer**
