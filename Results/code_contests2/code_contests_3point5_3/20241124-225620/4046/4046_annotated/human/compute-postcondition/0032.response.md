Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, i is the next even number greater than the current i value, and tem is an integer value obtained by converting the string x to an integer. If x contains an equal number of '7' and '4', then tem is calculated and if tem is greater than or equal to n, ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and tem. Otherwise, the values of n, l, ans, and i remain unchanged.***
