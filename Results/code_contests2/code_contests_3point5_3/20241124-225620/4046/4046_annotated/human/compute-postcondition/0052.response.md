Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than the updated next even number `i`, `l` is an even length, `ans` is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, `i` is the updated next even number greater than the current `i` value and is the length of the string '74' repeated i times, and `tem` is an integer value based on the conditions in the code. If the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4', then `tem` is formed by converting x to an integer. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment.***
