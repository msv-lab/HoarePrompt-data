Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than the updated next even number `i`, `l` is an even length, `ans` is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, `i` is the updated next even number greater than the current `i` value and is the length of the string '74' repeated i times, and `tem` is the integer value of the concatenated string `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. This ensures that `ans` holds the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem` after the if statement execution. This covers all cases where `tem` can be greater or equal to `n` based on the given preconditions.***
