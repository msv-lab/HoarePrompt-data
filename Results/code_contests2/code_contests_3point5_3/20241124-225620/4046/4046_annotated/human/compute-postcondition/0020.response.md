Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The value of `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`. The initial value of `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the previous value of `tem`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the updated value of `tem`, i is a positive integer, tem is greater than or equal to `n`, count of '7' in `x` is equal to count of '4'.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the updated value of `tem`, i is a positive integer, tem is greater than or equal to `n`, count of '7' in `x` is equal to count of '4'**
