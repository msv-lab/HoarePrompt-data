Example Answer:
`tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining all elements of list `x`. The value of `tem` is determined by the values in list `x`, which is not provided. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is the minimum value between 4444477777 and tem, i is a positive integer, tem is greater than or equal to n, count of '7' in x is equal to count of '4'.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is the minimum value between 4444477777 and tem, i is a positive integer, tem is greater than or equal to n, count of '7' in x is equal to count of '4'**
