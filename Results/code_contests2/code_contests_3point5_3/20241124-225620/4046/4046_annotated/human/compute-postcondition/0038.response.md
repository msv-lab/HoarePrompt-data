According to the code, the loop will execute again if the next even number greater than the current i value is still less than the given positive integer n. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, i is the updated next even number greater than the current i value, and tem is an integer value obtained by converting the string x to an integer. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Update n to be greater than the updated next even number i.
2. Update l to remain an even length.
3. Update ans to either remain as 4444477777 or the updated minimum value.
4. Update i to the next even number greater than the current i value.
5. Update tem based on the conditions mentioned in the code snippet.

State: **n is a positive integer greater than the updated next even number i, l is an even length, ans is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, i is the updated next even number greater than the current i value, and tem is an integer value obtained by converting the string x to an integer based on the conditions in the code.**
