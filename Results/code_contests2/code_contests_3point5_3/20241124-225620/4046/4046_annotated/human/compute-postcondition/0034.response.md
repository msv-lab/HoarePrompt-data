Example Answer:
The string `x` is converted to an integer and assigned to `tem`. The previous values of the affected variables are not mentioned, so the output state is: n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, i is the updated next even number greater than the current i value, and tem is an integer value obtained by converting the string x to an integer.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, i is the updated next even number greater than the current i value, and tem is an integer value obtained by converting the string x to an integer**
