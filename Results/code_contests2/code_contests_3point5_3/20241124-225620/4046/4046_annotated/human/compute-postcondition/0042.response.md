Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than the updated next even number i, l is an even length, ans is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, i is the updated next even number greater than the current i value, and tem is an integer value obtained by converting the string x to an integer based on the conditions in the code. If the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, tem is set to the integer value of x. If tem is greater than or equal to n, ans is updated to the minimum value between its current value and tem.***
