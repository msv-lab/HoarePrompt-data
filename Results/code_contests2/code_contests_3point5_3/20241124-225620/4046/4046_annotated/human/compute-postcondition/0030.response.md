Example Answer: 
The minimum value between `ans` and `tem` is assigned to `ans`. The previous value of `ans` is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value. The value of `tem` is an integer obtained by converting the string `x` to an integer, and it is greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, i is the next even number greater than the current i value, tem is an integer value obtained by converting the string x to an integer and tem is greater than or equal to n.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, i is the next even number greater than the current i value, tem is an integer value obtained by converting the string x to an integer, and tem is greater than or equal to n**
