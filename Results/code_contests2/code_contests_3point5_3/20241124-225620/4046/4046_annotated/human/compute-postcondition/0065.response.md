According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than the updated next even number `i`, `l` is an even length, `ans` is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, `i` is the updated next even number greater than the current `i` value and is the length of the string '74' repeated i times, and `tem` is an integer value based on the conditions in the code.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Update `i` to the updated next even number greater than the current `i` value for the next iteration.
- If `i` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute, so ensure that `i` is greater than 0 for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted for the next iteration.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the updated next even number `i`, `l` is an even length, `ans` is either 4444477777 or the updated minimum value, `i` is the updated next even number greater than the current `i` value and is the length of the string '74' repeated i times, and `tem` is an integer value based on the conditions in the code**
