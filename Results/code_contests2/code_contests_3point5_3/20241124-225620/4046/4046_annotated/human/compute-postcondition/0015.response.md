Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. Since `ans` is initially 4444477777 and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the new value of `ans` will be the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, i is a positive integer, tem is greater than or equal to n.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, l is an even length, ans is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, i is a positive integer, tem is greater than or equal to n**
