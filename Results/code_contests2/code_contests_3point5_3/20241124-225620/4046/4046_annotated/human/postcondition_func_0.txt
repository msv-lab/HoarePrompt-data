The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and calculates a specific value `ans` based on certain conditions. It then iterates through a nested loop to find the minimum value that satisfies a condition involving the count of '7's and '4's in the number `x`. The final minimum value found is printed as the output. The function does not explicitly return any value but performs the aforementioned calculations and print operation.
