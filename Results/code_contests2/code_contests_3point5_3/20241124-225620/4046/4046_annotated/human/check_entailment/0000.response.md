The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes a positive integer as input, finds the least super lucky number that is not less than the input integer, and outputs the result. The logic in the code ensures that the output number has an equal number of digits 4 and 7. The implementation covers all potential cases and correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem description.
