Output State: **If the loop executes, `c` is either 0 or 1, `a` is an integer. If `a` is odd, it is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, no changes are made to `a` and `c` remains 0. If `a` is in the values (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), print -1. Otherwise, print the result of `a / 4 + c`. If the loop does not execute (input is 0), `c` remains 0 and `a` retains its initial positive integer value.**
