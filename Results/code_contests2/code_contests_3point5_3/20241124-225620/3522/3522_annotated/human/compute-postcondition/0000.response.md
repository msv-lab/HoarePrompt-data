According to the code, the loop will execute based on the input value returned by `input()`. Since `a` is a positive integer, the loop will execute if the input value is greater than 0. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `a` is a positive integer and the input value returned by `input()` is greater than 0.
State: **Precondition**: **`a` is a positive integer, input value returned by `input()` is greater than 0**
