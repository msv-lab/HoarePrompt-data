Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over a range of integers provided by the user, calculates a new value for `a` based on whether it is odd, and prints different values based on certain conditions. If `a` is odd, it is decremented by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is one of the specified values (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `a / 4 + c`. If the input range is 0, then nothing is printed.**
