Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program iterates over the number of queries and handles each query correctly.
2. If the integer is odd, it is reduced by 9 and `c` is set to 1, ensuring that the number of summands is maximized.
3. If the integer is in the list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), which are prime numbers less than 12, then -1 is printed as there are no valid splittings.
4. For all other integers, the program calculates the maximum possible number of summands by dividing by 4 and adding `c`.
5. The code logic covers all cases mentioned in the problem description and produces the correct output for each query.
