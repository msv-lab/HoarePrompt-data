Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting to composite summands as described in the problem statement. It handles the case where the input is not composite by checking if the input is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11} and then returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of summands by dividing the input by 4 and adding a correction factor if needed. The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
