Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes the input queries and for each query, it determines the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting to composite summands and prints the result. If the input number is odd, it subtracts 9 and sets a flag `c` to 1, then checks if the number is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11} and prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the result by dividing the number by 4 and adding `c`. This logic aligns with the problem description and correctly handles all possible cases as specified. The code produces the expected output for all the given examples in the problem description.
