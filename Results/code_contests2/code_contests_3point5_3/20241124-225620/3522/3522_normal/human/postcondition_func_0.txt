The function `func()` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Inside the function, it iterates over a range specified by the user input, modifies the input number `a` by subtracting 9 if it is odd, sets `c` to 1 in that case, and then prints -1 if `a` is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}; otherwise, it prints the result of `a` divided by 4 plus `c`.
