Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value `0`, which means it is set to 0 regardless of the initial oddness of `a`. The initial state indicated that `c` could be either 0 or 1 depending on the oddness of `a`, but this assignment overrides that. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input value greater than 0, `c` is now 0.
Output State: **`a` is the input value greater than 0, `c` is now 0**
