Output State: **`a` is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1 if `a` is an odd integer. If `a` is an even integer, `c` remains 0. The output is -1 if `a` is 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11. Otherwise, the output is the result of `a` divided by 4 plus `c`. If the loop does not execute, `a` and `c` remain unchanged.**
