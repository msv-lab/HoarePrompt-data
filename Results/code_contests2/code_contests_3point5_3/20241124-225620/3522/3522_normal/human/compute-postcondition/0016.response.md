Example Answer:
The input value is stored in `a`. The initial oddness of `a` determines the value of `c`, which can be either 0 or 1. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the input value greater than 0, `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the initial oddness of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is the input value greater than 0, `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the initial oddness of `a`**
