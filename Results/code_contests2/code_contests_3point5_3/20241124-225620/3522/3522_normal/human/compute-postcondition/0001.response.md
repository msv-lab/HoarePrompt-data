Example Answer:
The value returned by `input()` is stored in variable `a`. Since `input()` returns a value greater than 0, `a` will hold a positive integer value. Therefore, the output state is: `a` stores a positive integer value greater than 0.
Output State: **`a` stores a positive integer value greater than 0**
