Example Answer:
If `a` is odd, then it is decreased by 9, and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, there is no change, but `c` remains either 0 or 1 depending on the initial oddness of `a`. The code then checks if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates `a / 4 + c`. Based on the initial state, we need to consider the possible values of `a` and `c` before the print statement.

Output State: **`a` is an input. If `a` is odd, `a` is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, there is no change. `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the initial oddness of `a`. The print statement either outputs -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) or `a / 4 + c` otherwise.**
