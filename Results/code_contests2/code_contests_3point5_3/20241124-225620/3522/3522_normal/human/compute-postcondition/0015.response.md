According to the code, the loop execution depends on the input value. If the input value is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is an input. If `a` is odd, `a` is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, there is no change. `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the initial oddness of `a`. The print statement either outputs -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) or `a / 4 + c` otherwise. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the input value should be greater than 0.
State: **`a` is an input value greater than 0, `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the initial oddness of `a`**
