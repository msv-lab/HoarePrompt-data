Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program iterates through the queries and for each query, it checks if the number is odd. If it is odd, it subtracts 9 from it and increments a counter. Then, it checks if the resulting number is one of the prime numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), if so, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of composite summands by dividing the number by 4 and adding the counter. The logic seems to be correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.
