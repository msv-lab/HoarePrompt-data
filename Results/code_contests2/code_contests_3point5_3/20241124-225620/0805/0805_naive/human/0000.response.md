Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes an integer N and a string S as input, which follows the problem description.
2. It shifts each character of the string S by N in alphabetical order, considering the edge case where `A` follows `Z`.
3. The program correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem description.
4. The logic of shifting characters is implemented correctly using modular arithmetic.
5. The program produces the correct output for all provided examples and potential cases.
