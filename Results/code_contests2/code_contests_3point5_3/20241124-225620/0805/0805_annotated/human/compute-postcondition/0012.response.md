Example Answer: 
`added_index` is assigned the value `index + n`. The value of `index` is the index of the next character in `strings` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. Therefore, the value of `added_index` depends on the specific character in `strings`. No other variables are affected by this operation.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is assigned the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string that contains the characters converted from `strings` based on the rotation by `n`, `s` is the next character in the `strings` string, `index` is the index of the next character in `strings` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `added_index` is the result of `index + n` based on the next character, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26 based on the next character, `new_s` is the character in `letters` at the `new_index` based on the next character**
