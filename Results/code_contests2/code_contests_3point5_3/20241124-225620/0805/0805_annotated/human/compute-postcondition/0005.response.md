Example Answer:
The variable `index` is assigned the value of the index of the character `s` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The value of `s` is the first character in the `strings` string, and `letters` is assigned the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. Therefore, the index of the first character in `strings` is assigned to `index`. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is assigned the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in the `strings` string, `index` is the index of the first character in `strings` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'**
