Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `strings` from user input. It then rotates each character in `strings` by `n` positions in the English alphabet, wrapping around if needed. The function prints the resulting rotated string `new_strings`. The function expects `n` to be between 0 and 26, and `strings` to consist of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4. If `strings` is empty, the function will not execute the rotation loop. **
