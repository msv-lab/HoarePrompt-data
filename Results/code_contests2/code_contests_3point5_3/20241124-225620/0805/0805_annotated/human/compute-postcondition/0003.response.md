Example Answer:
`new_strings` is assigned an empty string. The other variables `N`, `S`, `n`, and `letters` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `strings` is an input string, `letters` is assigned the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `strings` is an input string, `letters` is assigned the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string**
