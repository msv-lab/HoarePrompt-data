Example Answer:
The next character `s` in the `strings` string is considered. Its index `index` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' is calculated. The new index `added_index` is determined by adding `n` to the index. The character at the new index in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' is assigned to `new_s`, and `new_strings` is appended with `new_s`. The new index is then calculated as `added_index % 26`. The initial state variables are modified accordingly.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is assigned the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string that contains the characters converted from `strings` based on the rotation by `n`, `s` is the next character in the `strings` string, `index` is the index of the next character in `strings` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `added_index` is the result of `index + n` based on the next character, `new_s` is the character in `letters` at the `new_index` where `new_strings` is appended with `new_s, `added_index` is calculated as `index + n`, and `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26**
