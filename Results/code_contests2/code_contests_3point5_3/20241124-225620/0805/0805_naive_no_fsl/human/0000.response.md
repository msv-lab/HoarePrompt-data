Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes an integer N and a string S as input. It then shifts each character of the string S by N in alphabetical order and prints the resulting string. The program correctly handles the shifting logic by calculating the new index after shifting and wrapping around if the index exceeds 26. It uses the provided constraints of 0 <= N <= 26 and ensures that the input string consists of uppercase English letters. The output is also correctly formatted. The program works as expected for all potential cases and fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
