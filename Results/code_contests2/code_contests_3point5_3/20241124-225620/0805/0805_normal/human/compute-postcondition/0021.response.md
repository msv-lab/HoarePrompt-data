Example Answer:
`new_s` is added to `new_strings`. The value of `new_s` is the character at the `new_index` position in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The previous values of `new_strings`, `new_s`, `index`, `added_index`, and `new_index` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer, S is a string, n is an input integer, strings is assigned the remaining elements in the input string after the last iteration with at least one more element, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is the concatenation of new_s based on the input string, index is the index of string `s` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', added_index is the sum of `index` and `n', new_index is the result of added_index % 26, new_s is the character at the new_index position in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
Output State: **N is an integer, S is a string, n is an input integer, strings is assigned the remaining elements in the input string after the last iteration with at least one more element, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is the concatenation of new_s based on the input string, index is the index of string `s` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', added_index is the sum of `index` and `n', new_index is the result of added_index % 26, new_s is the character at the new_index position in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'**
