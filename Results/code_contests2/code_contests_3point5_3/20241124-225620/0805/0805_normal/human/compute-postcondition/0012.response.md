Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`, where `index` is the index of string `s` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' and `n` is the input integer. The calculation of `added_index` depends on the specific values of `index` and `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer, S is a string, n is an input integer, strings is assigned the remaining elements in the input string after the last iteration, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is the concatenation of new_s based on the input string, index is the index of string `s` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and added_index is the sum of `index` and `n`.
Output State: **N is an integer, S is a string, n is an input integer, strings is assigned the remaining elements in the input string after the last iteration, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is the concatenation of new_s based on the input string, index is the index of string `s` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and added_index is the sum of `index` and `n**'
