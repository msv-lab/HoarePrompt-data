Example Answer: 
added_index is assigned the value of index + n. The value of index is the index of s in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and n is an input integer. Therefore, added_index will be the sum of these two values. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **N is an integer, S is a string, n is an input integer, strings is assigned the input value, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, index is the index of s in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', added_index is the sum of index and n**
