Example Answer:
The new character new_s is calculated based on the index of the input string s in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The value of new_s is appended to the new_strings variable. The previous values of variables do not change except for the addition of new_s to new_strings. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer, S is a string, n is an input integer, strings is assigned the input value, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is the concatenation of new_s based on the input string.
Output State: **N is an integer, S is a string, n is an input integer, strings is assigned the input value, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is the concatenation of new_s based on the input string**
