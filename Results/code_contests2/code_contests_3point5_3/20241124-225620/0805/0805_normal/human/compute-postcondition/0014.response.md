Example Answer:
new_s is assigned the value of letters[new_index], where new_index is calculated as the result of the sum of index and n modulo 26. The variables N, S, n, strings, letters, new_strings, index, added_index are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer, S is a string, n is an input integer, strings is assigned the remaining elements in the input string after the last iteration, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is the concatenation of new_s based on the input string, index is the index of string `s` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', added_index is the sum of `index` and `n, and new_index is the result of added_index % 26, new_s is the character at the new_index position in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
Output State: **N is an integer, S is a string, n is an input integer, strings is assigned the remaining elements in the input string after the last iteration, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is the concatenation of new_s based on the input string, index is the index of string `s` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', added_index is the sum of `index` and `n, and new_index is the result of added_index % 26, new_s is the character at the new_index position in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'**
