Example Answer:
index is assigned the index of s in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' using the index method. The value of s is determined by the input value, and the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' is constant. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer, S is a string, n is an input integer, strings is assigned the input value, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, index is the index of s in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
Output State: **N is an integer, S is a string, n is an input integer, strings is assigned the input value, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, index is the index of s in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'**
