The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it is expected to utilize the constraints provided: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, and S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4. The function is expected to use these constraints in some way to perform its operations. As the function signature does not explicitly mention any parameters, it is likely that the function will internally access these constraints to achieve its functionality. 

Functionality: **The function internally accesses the constraints N (0 <= N <= 26) and S (string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4) to perform its operations, but does not explicitly accept any parameters.**
