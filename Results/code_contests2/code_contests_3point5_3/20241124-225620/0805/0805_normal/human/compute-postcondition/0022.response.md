At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

1. `strings` should have at least one more element than it had at the end of the previous iteration.
2. `new_strings` should be updated based on the new input string.
3. `index` should be updated based on the new `s` string in the iteration.
4. `added_index` should be recalculated as the sum of the new `index` and `n`.
5. `new_index` should be recalculated as the result of `added_index % 26`.
6. `new_s` should be updated as the character at the `new_index` position in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.

State: **N is an integer, S is a string, n is an input integer, strings is assigned the remaining elements in the input string after the last iteration with at least one more element, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is the concatenation of new_s based on the input string, index is the index of string `s` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', added_index is the sum of `index` and `n', new_index is the result of added_index % 26, new_s is the character at the new_index position in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'**.
