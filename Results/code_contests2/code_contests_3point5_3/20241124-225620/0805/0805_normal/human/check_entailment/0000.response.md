Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads an integer `n` and a string of uppercase English letters.
- It then shifts each letter in the input string by `n` positions in the alphabet and prints the resulting string.
- The code operates within the constraints of `n` (0 <= n <= 26) and the length of the input string (between 1 and 10^4).
- The code handles the case when the input string is empty by printing an empty string.
- The logic of shifting each character by `n` in alphabetical order is correctly implemented using the modulo operation to handle cases where the shift goes beyond the range of letters.

The output hints also agree with the code in terms of the functionality and constraints mentioned. Therefore, based on the code, the problem description, and the output hints, the correctness of the code is **True**.
