The function reads an integer `n` and a string of uppercase English letters. It then shifts each letter in the input string by `n` positions in the alphabet and prints the resulting string. If the input string is empty, the function prints an empty string. The function operates within the constraints of `n` (0 <= n <= 26) and the length of the input string (between 1 and 10^4). However, it does not explicitly accept any parameters as inputs.
