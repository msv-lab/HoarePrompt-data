Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is less than s + 1. If j is greater than k, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The loop continues without affecting other variables. The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] mod `mod`.**
