According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`. Based on the initial state provided, the values of `i`, `k`, `s`, and `n` are not directly related to the loop execution. The important conditions are that `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` values are determined.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute as follows:
State: **`i`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined**
