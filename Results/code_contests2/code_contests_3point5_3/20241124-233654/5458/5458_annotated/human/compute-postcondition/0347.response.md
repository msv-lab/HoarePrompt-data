Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not changed in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `j + 1` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`, `k` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s+1`, `s` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `j + 1` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`, `k` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s+1`, `s` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`, `n` is greater than 0**
