Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions. `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s]`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. In the other case where `j` is not greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program after the if else block execution.***
