According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` ranges from 0 to `n^2 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

1. Since `j` ranges from 2 to `m + 1` after each iteration and `j` needs to be incremented by 1, the new value of `j` should be `j + 1`, which implies `j` needs to be adjusted accordingly.
2. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, so `i` should be updated to 0.
3. Since `k` is between 1 and `s`, `k` should be adjusted to a valid value within this range depending on the end conditions of the previous iteration.
4. Considering the conditions for updating `dp` values based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` need to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` ranges from 2 to `m + 1` after each iteration, and `dp` values are updated based on the given conditions.**
