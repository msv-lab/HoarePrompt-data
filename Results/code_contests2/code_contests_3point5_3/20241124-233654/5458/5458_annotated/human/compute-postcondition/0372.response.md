Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are specified as 1, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are already determined, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j + 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`**
