Output State: 
After the loop executes, the values of the variables are as follows:
- `i` is within the range of 1 to `m`
- `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`
- `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`
- The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined based on the conditions within the loop.
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.
- If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.
- Additionally, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.
- If the loop does not execute, the values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
