According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` array is updated, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.

State: **`dp` array is updated. `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0**
