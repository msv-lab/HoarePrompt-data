Output State: 
- If the loop executes:
  - The value of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod` is printed where `n`, `m`, `s` are integers, and `mod` is a constant.
- If `n` is 0 or the loop does not execute due to initial conditions:
  - All variables remain unchanged.
- If `s` is less than or equal to 0:
  - The loop does not execute, and all variables remain in their initial state.
- If `s` is 1 or greater but `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`:
  - The loop does not execute, and no changes are made to the variables.
Output State: **The value of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod` is printed if the loop executes, otherwise variables remain unchanged.**
