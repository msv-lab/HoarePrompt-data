According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is in the range `[1, s]`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is updated in various ways based on the conditions provided. `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `k`. Since `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s]`, it needs to be incremented to the next value in that range.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s + 1]`**
