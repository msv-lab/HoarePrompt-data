Example Answer: 
If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. All other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 1 and `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 or maintains its initial condition, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and the calculation for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` as described above.**
