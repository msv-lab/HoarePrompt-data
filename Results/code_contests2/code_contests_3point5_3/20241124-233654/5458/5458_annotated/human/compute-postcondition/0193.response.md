Postcondition: ***`dp` array is updated. `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If none of the above conditions are met, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
