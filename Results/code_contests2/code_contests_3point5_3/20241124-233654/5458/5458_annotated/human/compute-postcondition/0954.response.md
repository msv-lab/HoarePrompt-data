According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is between 1 and `s+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 1 and `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or retains its initial value, and `j` equals `m + 1`..

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
- `j` needs to be updated to `m + 2` to maintain the condition `j = m + 1` after the execution of the loop.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 2 and `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or retains its initial value, and `j` equals `m + 2**
