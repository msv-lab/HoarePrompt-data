Output State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k` are all 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
