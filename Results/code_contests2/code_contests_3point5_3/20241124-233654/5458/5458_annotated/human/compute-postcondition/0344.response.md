According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `j + 1` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`, `k` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s+1`, `s` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`, `n` is greater than 0**
