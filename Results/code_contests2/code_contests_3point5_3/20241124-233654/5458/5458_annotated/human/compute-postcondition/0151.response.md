Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the first value in the range `[1, s]`, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. All edge cases, including the specified ranges and relationships between variables, are accurately handled, ensuring the correct state of the program variables after the execution of the if statement.***
