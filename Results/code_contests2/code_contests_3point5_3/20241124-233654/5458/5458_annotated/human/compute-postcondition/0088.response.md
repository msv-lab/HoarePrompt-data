Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `s` are integers. If `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In the if part, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. In the else part, if `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. All other variables retain their initial conditions within the specified ranges.***
