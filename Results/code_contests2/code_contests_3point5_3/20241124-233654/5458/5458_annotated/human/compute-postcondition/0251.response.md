According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Furthermore, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. If the loop does not execute, `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i` maintain their initial values. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `m + 1`.
State: **If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
