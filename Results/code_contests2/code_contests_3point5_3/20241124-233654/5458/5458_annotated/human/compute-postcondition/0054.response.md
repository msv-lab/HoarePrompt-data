Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases where `i` is not equal to 0, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, which is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and further incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Additionally, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m + 1` and `k` should be greater than 0 and less than or equal to `s`. When `(j >= k)` holds true, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are calculated as per the specified formula. The constraints `(j >= k)` and `(j <= m + 1)` are maintained, and `k` remains within the range of 1 to `s` inclusively.***
