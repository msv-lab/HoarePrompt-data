Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i` and `j` are incremented by 1, but the values of `m` and `k` are unknown. The state of variable `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `m`, `k` (incremented by 1), `s` (unchanged), and the assignment of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `k` (incremented by 1), `s` (unchanged), and the assignment of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
