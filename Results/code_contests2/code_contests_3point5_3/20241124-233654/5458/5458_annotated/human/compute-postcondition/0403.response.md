Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at the specified index in the 3D array `dp` is set to 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and `n`.***
