Postcondition: ***For the updated `dp` array in the next iteration, `i` is an integer updated based on the conditions, `j` is an integer updated based on the conditions, `m` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. All other elements in the `dp` array remain unchanged.***
