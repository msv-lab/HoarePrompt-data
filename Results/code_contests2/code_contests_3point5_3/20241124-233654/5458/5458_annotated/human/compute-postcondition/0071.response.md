Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The initial state shows that `i`, `j`, and `k+2` are integers. Therefore, the output state would be `i`, `j`, and `k+2` are integers, and the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is based on the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, and `k+2` are integers, and the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is based on the conditions mentioned above**
