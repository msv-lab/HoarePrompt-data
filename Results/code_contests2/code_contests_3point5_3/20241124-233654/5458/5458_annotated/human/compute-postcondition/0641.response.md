Output State: 
- `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `s`, `m`, `mod` are updated based on the conditions.
- If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
- If `i` is 1 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- If `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
- The loop will not execute if `s` is less than 1 or `j` is not less than `m`, in which case all variables remain unchanged.
