According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration. To adjust it, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` for the next iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 1**
