Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k` are all integers meeting the specified constraints, and `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k` are all integers meeting the specified constraints, and `k` is incremented by 1**
