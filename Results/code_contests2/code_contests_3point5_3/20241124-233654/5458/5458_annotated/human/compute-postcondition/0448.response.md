Postcondition: ***`i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.***
