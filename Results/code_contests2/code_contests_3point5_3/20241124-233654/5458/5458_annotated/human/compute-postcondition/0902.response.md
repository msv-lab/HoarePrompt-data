Postcondition: ***`dp` array values are adjusted based on if-else conditions. The variables `m`, `k`, `s`, and `i` maintain their initial conditions where `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. All other variables and array elements retain their respective values and relationships as per the precondition.***
