Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `i` and `j` are integers. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and the loop continues. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
