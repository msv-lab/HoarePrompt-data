Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is the next value in the range from 0 to `n^2 - 1`, `k` is 1, `i` equals 0, and `j` is an integer. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is updated to 1. The program maintains the initial conditions and updates the `dp` list accordingly, ensuring the integrity of the variables and indexes within the specified boundaries.***
