Postcondition: ***The `dp` array values are adjusted based on the conditions specified. The variables `m`, `k`, `s`, and `i` maintain their initial conditions where `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than `s`, and `i` is either 0 or not 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at the updated index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values in the `dp` array. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated using modulo operations. The variables `k` range from 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1.***
