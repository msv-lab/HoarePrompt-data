According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 1. Since `k` is 2, which is less than `s`, the loop will execute again. 

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2**
