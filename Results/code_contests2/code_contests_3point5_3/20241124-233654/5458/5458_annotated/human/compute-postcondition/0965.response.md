According to the code and the given conditions:
- The loop will execute if `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The loop will execute if `i` is either 0 or maintains its initial condition.
- The loop will execute if `j` is equal to `m + 1` or `m + 2` after each iteration.

Given the conditions, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `s` should be greater than or equal to 1
- `m` should be greater than or equal to 1
- `i` should either be 0 or maintain its initial condition
- `j` should be equal to `m + 1` or `m + 2` after the next iteration

State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is between 1 and `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or maintains its initial condition, `j` is equal to `m + 1` or `m + 2`**
