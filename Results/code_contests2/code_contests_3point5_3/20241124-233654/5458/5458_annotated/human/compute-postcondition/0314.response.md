Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are within the range of 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, otherwise, there is no change in the values of `dp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
Output State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
