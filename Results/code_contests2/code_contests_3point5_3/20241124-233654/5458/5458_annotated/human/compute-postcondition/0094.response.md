Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k+1`, `m`, `s` are integers. If the condition `j > k` holds true, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. This maintains the initial conditions where `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1`, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` is set to 1.***
