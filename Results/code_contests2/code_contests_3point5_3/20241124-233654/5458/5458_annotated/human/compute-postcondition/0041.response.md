According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases, where `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, then updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and further incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m + 1`.
State: **If i equals 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. In all other cases, where i is not equal to 0, if j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], then updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and further incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m + 1`**
