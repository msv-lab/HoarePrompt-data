Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is less than `s`, `s`, `m`, `mod` are updated.
Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is less than `s`, `s`, `m`, `mod` are updated**
