Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is `s + 1`, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined.
Output State: **`i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is `s + 1`, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined**
