According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is larger than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. Additionally, if `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the sum of the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to continue within the range of 1 to `m`. No other states need adjustment.
