Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is within the range [1, m], `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After running the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
