Postcondition: ***`dp` array values are adjusted based on if-else conditions, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. All other variables retain their initial conditions and relationships.***
