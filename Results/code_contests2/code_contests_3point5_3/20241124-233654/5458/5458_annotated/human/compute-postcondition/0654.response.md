According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a 2D list containing lists of zeros with dimensions `(2, m + 2, s + 1)` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is 1.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list containing lists of zeros with dimensions `(2, m + 2, s + 1)`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0**
