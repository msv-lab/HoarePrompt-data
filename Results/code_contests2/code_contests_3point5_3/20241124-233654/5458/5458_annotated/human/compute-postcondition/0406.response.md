Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and the specific relationship between them, the output state will be: `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has been made.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has been made**
