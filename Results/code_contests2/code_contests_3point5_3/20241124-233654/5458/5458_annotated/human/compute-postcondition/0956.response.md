Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 2 and `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or retains its initial value, `j` equals `m + 2`, and after the execution of the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The postcondition covers all possible edge cases and summarizes the state of the program variables accurately.***
