According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, `k` is incremented by 1 (less than or equal to `s - 1`)**
