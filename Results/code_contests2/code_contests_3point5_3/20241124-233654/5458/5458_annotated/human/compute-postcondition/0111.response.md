According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` 2D list is updated based on certain conditions. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be less than `n ** 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The `dp` 2D list is updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n ** 2`**
