Example Answer: 
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified in the initial state, the output state is: `dp` array values are adjusted based on if-else conditions, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`dp` array values are adjusted based on if-else conditions, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
