According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2**
