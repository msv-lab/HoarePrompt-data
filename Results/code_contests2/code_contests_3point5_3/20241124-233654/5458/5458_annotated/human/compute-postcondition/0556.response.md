Postcondition: ***For the updated `dp` array in the next iteration, `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer incremented by 1 or 2 based on the conditions. `m` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][1]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. `i`, `j`, and `m` are updated based on the conditions. `k` is incremented by 1***
