Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 1, `i` and `j` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then added with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program.***
