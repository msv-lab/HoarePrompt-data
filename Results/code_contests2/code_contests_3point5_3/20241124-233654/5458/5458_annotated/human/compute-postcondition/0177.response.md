Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions. `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s + 1]`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In the else part, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed by taking the modulo of the value at `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then adding the modulo of the value at `[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the correctness of the 2D list `dp` after the execution of the if-else block.***
