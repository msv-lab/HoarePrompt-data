According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2**
