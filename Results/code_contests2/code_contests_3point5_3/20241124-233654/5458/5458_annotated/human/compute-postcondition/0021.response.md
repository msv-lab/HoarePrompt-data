According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range `[1, s]`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions [2][m+2][s+1], `k` is greater than 1. 

In order for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is incremented by 1.
State: **mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m is greater than 0, s is greater than or equal to 0, j is 1, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions [2][m+2][s+1], k is incremented by 1**
