Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k` are known as integers, and `s` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is incremented by 1**
