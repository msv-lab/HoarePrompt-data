Example Answer: 
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`. The previous value of `mod` is 100000. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are determined by the input provided at runtime. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` are input integers obtained from splitting the input.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` are input integers obtained from splitting the input**
