Output State: **For the updated `dp` array in the next iteration, `i` is an integer updated based on the conditions, `j` is an integer updated based on the conditions, `m` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and the loop continues. Otherwise, there is no change in the `dp` array and the loop moves forward.**
