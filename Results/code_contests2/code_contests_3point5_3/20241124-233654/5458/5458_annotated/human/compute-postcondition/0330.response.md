According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `m` is at least 1. The variables `i`, `j + 1`, `k`, and `s` are within the range of 1 to `s`, and `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 1. 
State: **`i`, `j` is 1, `j + 1`, `k`, `s` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`, `n` is greater than 0**
