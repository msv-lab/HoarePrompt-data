According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the condition `k < s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be less than `s + 1`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k is less than s`.
State: **`i`, `j`, and `k+2` are integers, `k` is less than `s`**
