Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1. `j` is incremented by 1. `k` remains the same as the previous value. `s`, `m`, `mod`, `dp` are updated based on the mentioned conditions. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp` at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp` at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. All other variables retain their previous values and relationships as mentioned in the precondition.***
