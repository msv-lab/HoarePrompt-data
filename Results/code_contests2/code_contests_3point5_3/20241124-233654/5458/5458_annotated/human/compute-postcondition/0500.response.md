Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo operation of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then adding the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
