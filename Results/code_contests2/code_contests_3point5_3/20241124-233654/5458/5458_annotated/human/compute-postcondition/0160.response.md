According to the given conditions and the loop statement, the loop will execute one more time if `k` is less than `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is the first value in the range `[1, s]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range `[1, s]`.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s]`**
