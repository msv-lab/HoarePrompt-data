Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list containing lists of zeros with dimensions `(2, m + 2, s + 1)`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0. The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After executing the provided code snippet, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulus `mod`.**
