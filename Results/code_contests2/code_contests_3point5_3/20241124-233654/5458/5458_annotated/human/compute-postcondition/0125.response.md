Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the existing values of `dp`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated by taking the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with the modulus operation applied, maintaining the initial conditions and variable relationships.***
