Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` are not explicitly mentioned, so their values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` array values are adjusted based on if-else conditions, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`dp` array values are adjusted based on if-else conditions, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
