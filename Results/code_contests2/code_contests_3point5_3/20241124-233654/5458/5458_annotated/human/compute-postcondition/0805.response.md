Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` and `j` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
