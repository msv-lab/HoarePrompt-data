According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`, `m`, and the conditions specified for `dp`. Before the loop starts, the conditions need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases where `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, then updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and further incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m + 1`. Additionally, `k` should be greater than 0 and less than or equal to `s`.**

This adjustment ensures that the loop can execute with the specified conditions.
