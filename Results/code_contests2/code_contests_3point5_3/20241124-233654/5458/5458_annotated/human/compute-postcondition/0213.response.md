Output State: *`dp` array is updated. `k` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and then increased by the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. If `s` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the `dp` array remains unchanged. If `k` is 0, no updates are made to the `dp` array.**
