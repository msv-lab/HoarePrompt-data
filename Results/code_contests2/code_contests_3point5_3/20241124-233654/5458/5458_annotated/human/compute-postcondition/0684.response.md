Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), and `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers with `n` > 0, `m`, `s` are integers, `j` = 1, `k` = s - 1, and `s` > 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` >= `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` > `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the program continues. In the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Furthermore, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This covers all possible cases and edge scenarios of the program's execution.***
