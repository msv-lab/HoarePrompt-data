According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i`, `j`, `m`, `k` are integers incremented by 1, and `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **At the end of the loop execution, `i`, `j`, `m` are integers incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `s` remains unchanged**
