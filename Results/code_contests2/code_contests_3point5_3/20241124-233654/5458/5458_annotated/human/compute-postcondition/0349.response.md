Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `n` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the iteration continues without any change in the state. This condition covers all possible cases within the given ranges of `j`, `k`, and `s`.***
