Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 1 and `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or retains its initial value, and `j` equals `m + 1`. After the execution of the if-else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions:
- If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues.
- If `i` is not 0, `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then added to the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases for the program execution.***
