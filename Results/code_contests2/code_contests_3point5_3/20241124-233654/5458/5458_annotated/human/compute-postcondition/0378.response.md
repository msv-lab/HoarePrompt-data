According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are all equal to 1, `s` is at least 1. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined based on conditions involving `i`, `j`, and `k`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variable `k` as it is the looping variable. Since the loop is executed until `k` reaches `s`, we need to increment `k` by 1.

State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k` are all equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined as described. Increment `k` by 1.**
