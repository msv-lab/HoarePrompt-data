Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Since `i` is 0, it remains the same. `j` is incremented by 1, as `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, it maintains that condition. `m` remains at least 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
