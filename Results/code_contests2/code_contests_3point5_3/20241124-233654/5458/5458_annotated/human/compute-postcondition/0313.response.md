Postcondition: ***`i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `dp`, and the loop proceeds without any modification.***
