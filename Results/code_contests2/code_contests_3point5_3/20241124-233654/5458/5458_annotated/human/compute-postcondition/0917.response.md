Output State: **The `dp` array values are adjusted based on the if condition where `j` is greater than `k`. The variables `m`, `k`, `s`, and `i` maintain their initial conditions where `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than `s`, and `i` is either 0 or not 0. The state of the program after the if condition is executed ensures the continuity of the `dp` array values and the maintenance of the initial variable conditions.**
