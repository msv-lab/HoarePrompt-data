Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo calculation of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. All other variables remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block.***
