According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive). Therefore, the states need to be adjusted so that `k` is within that range. Additionally, the loop will execute based on the values of `i`, `j + 1`, and `s`. 

State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is an integer**
