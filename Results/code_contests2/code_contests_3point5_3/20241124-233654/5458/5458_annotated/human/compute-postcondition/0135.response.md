According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range `[1, s]`, and all other variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, covering all possible edge cases and scenarios.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s]`**
