Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned to 1. Since the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 0 when `i` is 0, the value is assigned to `dp[0][j + 1][k]` which changes the state of the variable. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is 1**
