According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`, so they are already within the acceptable range. The `dp` array being updated based on specified conditions does not affect the loop execution directly. If `n`, `m`, `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 
Therefore, the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n` is greater than 0.
State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`, `n` is greater than 0**
