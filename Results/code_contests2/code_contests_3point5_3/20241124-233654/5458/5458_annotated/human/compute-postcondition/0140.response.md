Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s]`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. This ensures the state of the program variables is maintained according to the initial conditions and the relationship between `j` and `k` is handled appropriately.***
