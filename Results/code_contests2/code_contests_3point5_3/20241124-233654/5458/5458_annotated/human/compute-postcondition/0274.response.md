According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. Therefore, to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is larger than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. Additionally, if `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the sum of the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. `k` is less than `s`. `k` is less than `s + 1`.**
