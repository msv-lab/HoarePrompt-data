Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1). `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers where `n` > 0, `m`, `s` are integers, `j` = 1, `k` = s - 1, and `s` > 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program continues without further modifications.***
