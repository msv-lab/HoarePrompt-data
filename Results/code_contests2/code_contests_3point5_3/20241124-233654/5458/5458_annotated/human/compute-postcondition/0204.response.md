Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` array is updated, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`dp` array is updated, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0**
