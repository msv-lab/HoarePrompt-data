Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s]`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The postcondition covers all possible edge cases including the specific values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` in the given ranges and conditions.***
