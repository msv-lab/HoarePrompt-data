Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and `n`.***
