Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions [2][m+2][s+1], `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. This assignment covers all possible edge cases and scenarios for the given program fragment.***
