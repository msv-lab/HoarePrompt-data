Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, `k` is incremented by 1 (less than or equal to `s - 1`). If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This condition continues for all valid values of the variables, ensuring the correctness of the program state after the execution of the if statement.***
