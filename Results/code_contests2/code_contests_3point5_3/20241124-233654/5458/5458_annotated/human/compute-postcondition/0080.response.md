Postcondition: ***`i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions within the specified ranges.***
