Postcondition: ***`i`, `j + 1`, `k` are all equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined based on the condition: if `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Additionally, `i` remains 0 throughout the execution of the program fragment.***
