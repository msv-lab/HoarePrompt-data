Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned in the else part. In the case where `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.**
