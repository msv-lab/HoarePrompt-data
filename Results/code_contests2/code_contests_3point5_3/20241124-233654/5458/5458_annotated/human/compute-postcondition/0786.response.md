Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k` are all integers meeting the specified constraints, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` in the `dp` list. Otherwise, no changes are made to the `dp` list. This postcondition accounts for the scenario where `j` is greater than `k` and ensures the proper handling of the values in the `dp` list based on this condition.***
