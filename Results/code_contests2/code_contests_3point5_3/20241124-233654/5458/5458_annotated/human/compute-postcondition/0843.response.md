Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly mentioned, so the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 1, `i` and `j` are integers.
Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 1, `i` and `j` are integers**
