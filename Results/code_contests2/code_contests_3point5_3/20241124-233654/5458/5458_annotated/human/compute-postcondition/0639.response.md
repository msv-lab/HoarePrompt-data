Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1. `j` is incremented by 1. `k` is less than `s`. `s`, `m`, and `mod` are updated. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Ensure all possible cases are covered to accurately represent the final state of the program variables after the execution of the if else block.***
