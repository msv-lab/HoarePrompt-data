According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `mod` are not provided, but we know that `i` is an integer (0 or 1). 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Set `i` to either 0 or 1 based on the loop condition.
- Increment `j` by 1 or 2 based on the conditions provided.
- Set `k` to an integer less than or equal to `s`.
- Set `m` to at least 1.
- Set `mod` to a constant value.

State: **`dp` array is updated with the above conditions.**
