Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 1, adjusted values of `i` and `j` based on the logic of the code. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. The program execution continues without any change to other variables.**
