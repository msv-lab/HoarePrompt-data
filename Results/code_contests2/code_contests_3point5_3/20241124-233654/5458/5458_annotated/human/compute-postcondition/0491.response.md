Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k` and `i` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then added to the sum of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. In the case where `i` is 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, no change occurs in the state.***
