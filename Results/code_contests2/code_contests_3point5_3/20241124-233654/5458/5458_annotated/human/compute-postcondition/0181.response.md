According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, dp array is updated does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is now 1. 
State: **`dp` array is updated, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0**
