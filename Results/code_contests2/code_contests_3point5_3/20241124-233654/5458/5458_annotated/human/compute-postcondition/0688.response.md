According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated**
