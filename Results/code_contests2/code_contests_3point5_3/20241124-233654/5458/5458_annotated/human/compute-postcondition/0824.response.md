According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `s + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1, `i` and `j` are integers**
