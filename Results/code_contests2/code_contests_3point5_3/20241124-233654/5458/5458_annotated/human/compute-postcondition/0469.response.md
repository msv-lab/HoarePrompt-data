According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows:
- `i` is within the range of 1 to `m`
- `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`
- `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`
- The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` have been determined based on the conditions within the loop.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Increment `j` by 1 to ensure that it remains within the range of 1 to `m`.
- Since the instructions do not mention any changes to `i` and `k`, they remain the same.
- Apply the conditions provided to update the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the logic within the loop.

State: **`i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the loop conditions**
