According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers, so they don't affect the loop execution directly. However, for the loop to execute, `k` should start from 1. 
State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
