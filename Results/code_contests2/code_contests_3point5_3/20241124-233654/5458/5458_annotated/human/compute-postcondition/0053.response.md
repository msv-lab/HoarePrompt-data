Example Answer:
dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. The previous values of i, j, and k are not provided, so the output state is: If i is not equal to 0, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the mentioned calculations.
Output State: **If i is not equal to 0, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the mentioned calculations**
