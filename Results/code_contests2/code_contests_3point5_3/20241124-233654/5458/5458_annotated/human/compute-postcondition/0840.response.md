According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 1, `i` and `j` are integers**
