According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` has to be set to 1 initially. Additionally, the loop conditions require `i` to be within the range of 1 to `m` and `j` to be within the range of 1 to `m`. Hence, for the loop to execute, `i` and `j` should be set to 1 as well.
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the loop conditions**
