Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, `k` is incremented by 1 (less than or equal to `s - 1`). If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, in the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This postcondition covers all the possible cases and edge scenarios of the program execution.***
