According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `n` are integers. `j + 1` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and `n` is greater than 0. The conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are also specified based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the state of `k` needs to be updated. Since the loop iterates over `k` in the range of 1 to `s`, and at the end of the previous iteration, `k` is within this range, the next value of `k` should be considered. Therefore, `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value within the range of 1 to `s`.

State: **`i`, `j`, `k+1`, `s`, `n` are integers. `j + 1` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and `n` is greater than 0.**
