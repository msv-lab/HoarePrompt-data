Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` and `j` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if-else block.***
