Postcondition: ***`dp` array values are adjusted based on if-else conditions, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then the element at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than 2, then the element at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is updated to the modulo of the element at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][2]`. Additionally, the element at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is increased by the modulo of the element at `dp[i & 1][j][2 - j]`. In all cases, the values of `m`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
