Postcondition: ***The `dp` array values are adjusted based on the if-else conditions. The variables `m`, `k`, `s`, and `i` maintain their initial conditions where `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is either 0 or not 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Subsequently, if `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified to be the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. All other variables and array elements retain their respective values and relationships as per the precondition.***
