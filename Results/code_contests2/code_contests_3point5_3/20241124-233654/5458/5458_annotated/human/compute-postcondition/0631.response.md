According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `s`, `m`, `mod` are updated based on the conditions. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. 
If `i` is 1 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
If `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Based on the above conditions, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:
State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is less than `s`, `s`, `m`, `mod` are updated**.
