Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. The previous values of i, j, and k are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: s is greater than or equal to 1, k is 2, j is within the range [1, m], i is an integer.
Output State: **s is greater than or equal to 1, k is 2, j is within the range [1, m], i is an integer**
