Postcondition: ***For the updated `dp` array in the next iteration, `i` is an integer updated based on the conditions, `j` is an integer updated based on the conditions, `m` is at least 1, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and the loop continues. In all other cases, there is no change in the `dp` array, and the loop progresses accordingly.***
