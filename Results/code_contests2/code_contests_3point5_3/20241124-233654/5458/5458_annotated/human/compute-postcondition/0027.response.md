Output State: **mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m is greater than 0, s is greater than or equal to 0, j is 1, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions [2][m+2][s+1], k is incremented by 1. If j is greater than k, then the value in dp at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value in dp at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k], otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.**
