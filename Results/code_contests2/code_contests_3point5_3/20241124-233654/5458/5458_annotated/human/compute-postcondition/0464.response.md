Output State: **`i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is `s + 1`, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues. Otherwise, no changes are made to the values of the variables, and the program proceeds as is.**
