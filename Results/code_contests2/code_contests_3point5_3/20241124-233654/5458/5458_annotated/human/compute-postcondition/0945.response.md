According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 or maintains its initial condition, `j` is equal to `m + 1`. Based on the conditions provided, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

1. Since the loop variable is `k`, it will iterate from 1 to `s`. As the loop is executed for each value of `k`, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. No other states need to be adjusted based on the information provided.

State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 1 and `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 or maintains its initial condition, `j` is equal to `m + 1**
