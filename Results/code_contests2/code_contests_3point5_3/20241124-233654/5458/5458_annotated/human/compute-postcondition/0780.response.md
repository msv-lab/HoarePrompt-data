Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k` are all integers meeting the specified constraints, `k` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the element at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] in dp is assigned the value of the element at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod in dp, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. All other elements in dp remain unchanged.***
