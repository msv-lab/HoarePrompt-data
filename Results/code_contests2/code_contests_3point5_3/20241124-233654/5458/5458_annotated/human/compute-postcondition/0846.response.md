Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the division of the previous value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 1, `i` and `j` are integers, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the given formula.
Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 1, `i` and `j` are integers, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the given formula**
