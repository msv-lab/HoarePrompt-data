Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. The previous values of i, j, and k are not explicitly given, but k is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to s - 1. Therefore, the output state is: i, j, k are integers, s is at least 1, n is an appropriate integer, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **i, j, k are integers, s is at least 1, n is an appropriate integer, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1**
