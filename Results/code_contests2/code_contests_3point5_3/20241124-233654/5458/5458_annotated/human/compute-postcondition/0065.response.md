Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k+2` are unknown, so after execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, and `k+2` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, and `k+2` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
