According to the code, the loop will execute for `s` times. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are all equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, and `n` is an appropriate integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **If `i` is 0 and `j >= 1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][1]` is set to 1. For all other cases, the loop will execute for `s` times updating the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` based on the given conditions and calculations. After the loop execution, `i`, `j + 2`, `k` will all be equal to 1, `s` will be at least 1, `n` will be an appropriate integer.**
