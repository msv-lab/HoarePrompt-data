Output State: **`dp` array values are adjusted based on if-else conditions, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. If `m` is less than 1 or `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `dp` array values remain unchanged.**
