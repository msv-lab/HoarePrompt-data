Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `n` are integers. `j + 1` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, `s` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and `n` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
