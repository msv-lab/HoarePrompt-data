Output State: **i, j, k, s, n remain integers where i is not equal to 0. j is 1, j + 1 is within the range of 1 to s, k is within the range of 1 to s, and s is within the range of 1 to s. Additionally, n is greater than 0. If j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. No other changes occur to the variables i, j, k, s, or n after the execution of the if statement.**
