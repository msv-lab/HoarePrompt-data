Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **`i`, `j`, and `k+2` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
