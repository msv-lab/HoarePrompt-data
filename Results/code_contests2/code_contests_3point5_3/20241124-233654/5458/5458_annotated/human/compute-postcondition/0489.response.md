Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no change occurs in the state. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.**
