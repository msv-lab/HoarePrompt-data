Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `k`, `s` are integers. `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1. `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. This assignment represents a specific state transition in the program, where the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to 1 based on the condition `j >= k`. No other changes occur to the variables `i`, `j`, `m`, `k`, `s` as a result of this if statement.***
