Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s + 1]`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the 2D list `dp` is set to the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
