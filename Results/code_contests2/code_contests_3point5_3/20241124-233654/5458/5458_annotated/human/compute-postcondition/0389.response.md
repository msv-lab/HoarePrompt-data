Postcondition: ***`i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are all equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` are determined as described. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. This condition holds true for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`, ensuring the correct assignment to `dp` based on the comparison between `j` and `k`.***
