Postcondition: ***If i is not equal to 0, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and further incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod when j is less than or equal to m + 1 and k is greater than 0 and less than or equal to s. In cases where j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].***
