Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is within the range [1, m], `i` is an integer. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.***
