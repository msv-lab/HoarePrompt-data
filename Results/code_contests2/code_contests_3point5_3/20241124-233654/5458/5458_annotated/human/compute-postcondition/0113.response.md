According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` 2D list being updated based on given conditions does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1.
State: **`dp` 2D list is updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
