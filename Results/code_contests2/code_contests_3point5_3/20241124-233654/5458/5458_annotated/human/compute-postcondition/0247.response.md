Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j` is within the range [1, m], `i` is an integer. If `j` is greater than 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After the execution of the code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
