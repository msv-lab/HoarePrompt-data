According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is `s + 1`, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` have been determined based on the conditions provided. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since `k` is currently `s + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be adjusted to `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`.
2. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` need to be updated based on the conditions stated in the code.

State: **`i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` have been properly adjusted.**
