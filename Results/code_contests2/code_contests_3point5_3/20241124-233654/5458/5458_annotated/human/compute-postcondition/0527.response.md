Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The value of i, j, and k are not explicitly mentioned but given that `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2, we can deduce that `i`, `j`, `k` are incremented by 1. Therefore, the output state is: `i`, `j`, `k` are integers incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
