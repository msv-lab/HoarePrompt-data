According to the code, the loop can execute if the range from 1 to s is valid. So, for the loop to execute, the value of `s` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1. Since the loop variable is `k`, to ensure the loop executes, `k` should start from 1. 
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is the next value in the range from 0 to `n^2 - 1`, `k` is 1**
