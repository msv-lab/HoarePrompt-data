Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1. `j` is incremented by 1. `k` is less than or equal to `s`. `s`, `m`, and `mod` are updated based on the conditions. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the program continues execution. All variables retain their initial conditions, and the relationship between `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `m`, `mod`, and `dp` is maintained. Potential edge cases such as `j` being equal to `k` are accounted for, ensuring the correctness of the program execution.***
