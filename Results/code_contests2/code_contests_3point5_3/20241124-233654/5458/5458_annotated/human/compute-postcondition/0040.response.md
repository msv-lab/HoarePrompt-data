Output State: **If i equals 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. In all other cases, where i is not equal to 0, if j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and further incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. This postcondition covers all edge cases and scenarios for the given program fragment.**
