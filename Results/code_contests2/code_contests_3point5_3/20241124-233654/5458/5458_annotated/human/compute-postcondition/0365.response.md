According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `k` reaches `s+1` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is 1. Additionally, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` being determined implies that `i`, `j + 1`, and `n` should have appropriate values to support the loop execution.
State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined**
