Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the condition provided. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. The other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is incremented by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions provided**
