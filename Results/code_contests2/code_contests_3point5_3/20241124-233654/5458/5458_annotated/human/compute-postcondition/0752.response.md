Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to s+1. If i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then the element at index [1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. In all other cases, the values in dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] are determined by the previous values of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases within the given range of variable values.***
