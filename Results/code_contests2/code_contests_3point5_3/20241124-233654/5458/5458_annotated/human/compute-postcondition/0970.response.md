According to the code, the `while` loop will execute indefinitely as it is a `while True` loop. Hence, the program state at the end of the previous iteration can simply be repeated for the next iteration. No adjustments need to be made.
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` either maintains its initial condition or is 0, `j` ranges from 1 to `m` after each iteration, and the value of `dp[n`**
