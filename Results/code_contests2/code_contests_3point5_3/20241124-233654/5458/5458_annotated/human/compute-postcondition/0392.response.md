Postcondition: ***`i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are all equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` are determined as described. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This accounts for all possible scenarios of the variables involved in the program fragment.***
