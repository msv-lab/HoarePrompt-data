Output State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `k`, `s` are integers. `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
