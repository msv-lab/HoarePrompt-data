According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. Since `k` is defined by the loop iterator, it will always be within the required range. Therefore, the key states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `m`, `s`, and `j`.

State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` maintains its initial condition, `j` is `m + 1**
