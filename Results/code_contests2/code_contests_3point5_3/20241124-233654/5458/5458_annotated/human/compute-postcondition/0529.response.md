Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not changed in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2**
