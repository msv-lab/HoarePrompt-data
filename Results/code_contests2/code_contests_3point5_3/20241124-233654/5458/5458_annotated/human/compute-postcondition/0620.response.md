Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` remains the same, `s`, `m`, `mod` are updated based on conditions, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp` at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp` at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` plus `dp` at indices `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
