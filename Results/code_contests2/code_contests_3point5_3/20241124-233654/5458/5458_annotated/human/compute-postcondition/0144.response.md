According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is in the range `[1, s]`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s]`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. The value of `k` should be incremented to the next value in the range `[1, s]`.
2. If the value of `k` reaches `s`, then the loop will not execute again.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s]`**
