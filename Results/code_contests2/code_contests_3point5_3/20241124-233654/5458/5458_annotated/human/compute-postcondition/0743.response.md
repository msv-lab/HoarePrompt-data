Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1). `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to s. If i == 0 and j >= k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i != 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, if j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. All other elements of dp remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block, covering all possible edge cases.***
