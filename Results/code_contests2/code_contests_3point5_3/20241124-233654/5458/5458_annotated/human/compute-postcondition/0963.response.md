According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is between 2 and `s+1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 2 and `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or retains its initial value, and `j` equals `m + 2`. 

To prepare for the next iteration:
- Since `k` is between 2 and `s+1` in the previous iteration, it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, adjust `k` to `k + 1`.
- No other states need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 3 and `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or retains its initial value, `j` equals `m + 2**.
