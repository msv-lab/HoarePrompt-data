According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are all equal to 1, `s` is at least 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k + 1` and `s` needs to be adjusted to at least `s + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are all equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer**.
