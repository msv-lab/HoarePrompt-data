According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` iterates from 1 to `s` inclusively. Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the values of `i`, `j`, `m`, and `s` are set such that the conditions `(j >= k)`, `(j <= m + 1)`, and `(k > 0 and k <= s)` are satisfied. Since the loop initializes `k` from 1, we need to set the initial values accordingly.
State: **`i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 based on the conditions**.
