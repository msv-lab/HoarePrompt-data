Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions and relationships.***
