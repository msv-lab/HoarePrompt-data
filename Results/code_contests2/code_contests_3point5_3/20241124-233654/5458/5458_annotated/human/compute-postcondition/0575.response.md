According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i`, `j`, and `m` are not directly related to the loop execution, but since `k` is the loop variable, it needs to be adjusted to start from 1. 
State: **`i`, `j`, `m` are integers, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1**
