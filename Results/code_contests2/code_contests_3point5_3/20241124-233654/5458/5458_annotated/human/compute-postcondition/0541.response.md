According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` for the next iteration indicates that `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `m` is at least 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` for the next iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 1.
State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` for the next iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 1**
