According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k ranges from 1 to s+1. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, and `k` ranges from 1 to s+1. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range 1 to s+1, which is k+1.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to s+1, with k incremented by 1**
