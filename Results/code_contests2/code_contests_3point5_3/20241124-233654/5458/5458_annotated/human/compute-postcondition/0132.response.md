Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions. `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
