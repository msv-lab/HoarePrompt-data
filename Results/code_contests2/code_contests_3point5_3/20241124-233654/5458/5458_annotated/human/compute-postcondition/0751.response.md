Example Answer: 
The values in dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] are updated by adding the values in dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. The dimensions of dp remain the same, the values in the specific indices are modified accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to s+1, values in dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] are updated based on the previous values of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to s+1, values in dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] are updated based on the previous values of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod**
