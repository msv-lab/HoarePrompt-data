According to the code, the loop can execute again if `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute. At the end of the last iteration, the previous state is the Output State. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `s` needs to be at least 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `dp` array is updated, all other variables remain the same as the initial state**
