Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list containing lists of zeros with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `s` are integers, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Regardless of the condition, all other variables retain their initial values and constraints.***
