Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k` are all integers with the specified constraints. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The program continues without any changes to the other variables.**
