Postcondition: ***`dp` array is updated, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then the element at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than 3, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. In all other cases, the `dp` array remains unchanged. The values of `k` and `s` stay the same.***
