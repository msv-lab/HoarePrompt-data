Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers where `n` > 0, `m`, `s` are integers, `j` = 1, `k` = 1, `s` > 0. If `i` = 0 and `j` >= `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` != 0 and `j` > `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After the provided code snippet executes, the value at `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulus `mod`. All other variables remain within their initial constraints and values.***
