Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but since `k` is given as 2, the value of `k` remains 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` array is updated, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`dp` array is updated, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0**
