According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m` and `n`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` 2D list is updated based on the given conditions does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is 1. 
State: **`dp` 2D list is updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1**
