According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k` are all integers meeting the specified constraints, and `k` is incremented by 1. Since `k` is incremented by 1 and the loop can execute until `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`, which should now be the incremented value of the previous `k`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k` are all integers meeting the specified constraints, `k` is incremented by 1**
