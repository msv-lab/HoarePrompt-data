According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range [1, s]. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is within the range [1, m], and `i` is an integer. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since the loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s+1`, `k` needs to be updated to `k` is 3.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j` is within the range [1, m], `i` is an integer**
