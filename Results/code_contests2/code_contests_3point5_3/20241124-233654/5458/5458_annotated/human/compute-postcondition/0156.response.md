Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the first value in the range `[1, s]`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the specific update to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the if else block executes.***
