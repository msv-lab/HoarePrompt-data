According to the code, the loop can execute as long as s is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `s` is the condition that determines if the loop will execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is 1.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
