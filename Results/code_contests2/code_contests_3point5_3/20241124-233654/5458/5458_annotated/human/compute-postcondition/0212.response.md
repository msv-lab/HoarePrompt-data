According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` in the range from 1 to `s` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `dp` array is updated, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0. If the loop is to execute one more time, `k` will need to be adjusted to the next value in the range, which is 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` array is updated, `k` is 4, `s` is greater than 0**
