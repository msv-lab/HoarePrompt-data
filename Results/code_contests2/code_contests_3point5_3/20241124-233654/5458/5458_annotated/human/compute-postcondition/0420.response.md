Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, `k` is incremented by 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
