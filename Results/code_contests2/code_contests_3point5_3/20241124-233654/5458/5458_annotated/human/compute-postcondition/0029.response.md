Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m is greater than 0, s is greater than or equal to 0, j is 1, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions [2][m+2][s+1], k is incremented by 1. After the execution of the if-else block, the state of the program is as follows: if i == 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1; otherwise, no changes occur. In the else part, if j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the value in dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. All other variables and structures maintain their initial values and relationships, handling all edge cases comprehensively.***
