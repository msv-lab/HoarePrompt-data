Output State: **`dp` array values are adjusted based on if-else conditions. `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is set to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program continues without any other changes.**
