Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to s + 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. After the execution of the if else block, the program retains its initial state with the specified conditions, ensuring the integrity of the variables and their relationships.***
