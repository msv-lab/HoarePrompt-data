Output State: **After the loop executes, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. If `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `j` is 1, and `k` is at least 1. 
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
- After the execution of the loop, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is further updated by adding the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulus `mod`.
- In cases where the loop does not execute (e.g., when `s` is 0), all variables retain their initial values as per the initial state.**
