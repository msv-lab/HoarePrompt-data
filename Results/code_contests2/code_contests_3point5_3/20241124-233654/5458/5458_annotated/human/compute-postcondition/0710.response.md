According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 2. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to a value less than `s + 1`.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is less than s + 1**
