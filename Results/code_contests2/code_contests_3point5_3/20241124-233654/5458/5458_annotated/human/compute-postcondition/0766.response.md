Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not altered by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k` are all integers with the specified constraints, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has been made.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k` are all integers with the specified constraints, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has been made**
