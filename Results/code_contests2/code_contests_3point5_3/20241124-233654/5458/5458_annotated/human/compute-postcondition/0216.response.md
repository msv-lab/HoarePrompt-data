According to the code, the loop will execute at least once when `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` will be within the range `[1, s]`. At the end of the last iteration, if `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute. If `k` is 0, no updates are made to the `dp` array. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **Adjust `s` to be greater than or equal to 1 and adjust `k` to be within the range `[1, s]`**.
