According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a 2D list containing lists of zeros with dimensions `(2, m + 2, s + 1)` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. 
State: **`dp` is a 2D list containing lists of zeros with dimensions `(2, m + 2, s + 1)`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers assigned the values returned by `map(int, raw_input().split())`**
