According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`, and specific conditions are checked to update the `dp` array. If `s` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `s` is a positive integer, then the loop will execute again. 
- Increment `j` by 1 to continue with the next iteration.
- All other states (`i`, `k`) remain the same as they are not directly involved in the loop condition.

State: **`i`, `j + 2`, `k` are integers within the range of 1 to `s` (assuming `s` is a positive integer)**
