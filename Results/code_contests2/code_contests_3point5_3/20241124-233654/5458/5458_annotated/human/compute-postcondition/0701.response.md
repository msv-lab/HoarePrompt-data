According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted accordingly. Since the loop is iterating over `k` from 1 to `s + 1`, the next value of `k` should be incremented by 1. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 2**
