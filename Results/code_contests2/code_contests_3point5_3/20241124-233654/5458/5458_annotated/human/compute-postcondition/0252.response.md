According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is equal to `s`. 
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is equal to `s`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
