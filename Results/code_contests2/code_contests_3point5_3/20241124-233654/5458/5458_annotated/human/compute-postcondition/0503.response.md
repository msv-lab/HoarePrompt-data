According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k` and `i` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then added to the sum of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. In the case where `i` is 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, no change occurs in the state.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `s` must be at least 1.
State: **`i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers with `s` being at least 1**
