Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The initial state of the variables remains the same with the specified conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to s + 1, `i` is not equal to 0.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to s + 1, `i` is not equal to 0**
