Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the loop conditions where if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.**
