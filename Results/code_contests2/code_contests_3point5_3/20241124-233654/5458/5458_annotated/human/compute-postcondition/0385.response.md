Output State: `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are all equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no assignment is made. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined by the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
