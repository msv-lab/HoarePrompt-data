According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range [1, `s`]. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3. To execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to 4, as it should be within the range [1, `s`]. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 4, `j` is within the range [1, m], `i` is an integer**
