According to the code, the loop will execute if `s` is at least 1. Since `m` is greater than 1, it does not affect the loop execution. Before the loop starts, the variables that need to be adjusted are `s` to be at least 1 and `k` to be 1.
State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 1**
