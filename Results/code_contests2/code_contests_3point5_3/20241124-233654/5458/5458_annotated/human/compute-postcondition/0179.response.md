Output State: 
If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. For all other cases where `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Additionally, in the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The loop will execute at least once when `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` will take on values in the range `[1, s]`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and the values of all variables will remain the same as the initial state.
