Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1, the new state of `i`, `j`, and `k` will be incremented by 1. The value of `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `m`, `k` are all incremented by 1, `s` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `k` are all incremented by 1, `s` remains unchanged**
