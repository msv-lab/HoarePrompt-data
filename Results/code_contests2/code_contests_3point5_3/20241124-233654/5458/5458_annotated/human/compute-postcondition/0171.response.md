Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions. `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s + 1]`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. This update ensures that the specific condition is met in the 2D list `dp`, considering the constraints on `i`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k`.***
