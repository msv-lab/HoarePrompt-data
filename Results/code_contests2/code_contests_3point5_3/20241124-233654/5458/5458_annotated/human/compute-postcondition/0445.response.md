Postcondition: ***`i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
