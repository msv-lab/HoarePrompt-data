Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `k`, `s` are integers. `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All other variables remain unchanged based on the conditions in the program fragment.***
