Postcondition: ***The `dp` array values are updated based on the conditions specified. The variables `m`, `k`, `s`, and `i` maintain their initial conditions throughout. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at the updated index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values in the `dp` array. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated using modulo operations. The range of `k` is between 1 and `s + 1`, where `s` is greater than or equal to 1.***
