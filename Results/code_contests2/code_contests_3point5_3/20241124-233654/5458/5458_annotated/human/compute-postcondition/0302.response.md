Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This means the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment.
Output State: **No change in the values of `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
