Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 or maintains its initial condition, `j` is equal to `m + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of its previous value modulo `mod` and the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
