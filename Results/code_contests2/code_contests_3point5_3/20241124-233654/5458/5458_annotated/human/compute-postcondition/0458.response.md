According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined based on the conditions provided. 

To execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since `k` is currently within the range of 1 to `s`, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `k` should be outside the range of 1 to `s`. Therefore, `k` should be adjusted to `k` equals `s + 1`.
State: **`i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is `s + 1`, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined**
