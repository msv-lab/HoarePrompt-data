Postcondition: ***`dp` array is updated. `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 2, the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then added with the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment.***
