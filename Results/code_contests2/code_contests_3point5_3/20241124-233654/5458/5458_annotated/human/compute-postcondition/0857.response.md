Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 1. After the execution of the if statement, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1 with adjusted values of `i` and `j` based on the code logic. In the else part, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Furthermore, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. All other variables retain their initial values.***
