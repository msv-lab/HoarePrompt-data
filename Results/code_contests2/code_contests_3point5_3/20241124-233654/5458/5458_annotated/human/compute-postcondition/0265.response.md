According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is larger than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. Additionally, if `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the sum of the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be less than `s`.
State: **`i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is larger than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. Additionally, if `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the sum of the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. `k` is less than `s`**
