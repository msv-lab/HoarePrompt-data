Postcondition: ***`i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.***
