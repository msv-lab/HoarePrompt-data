According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than `s`.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. `n` > 0, `m`, `s` are integers, `j` = 1, `k` = s - 1, `s` > 0**
