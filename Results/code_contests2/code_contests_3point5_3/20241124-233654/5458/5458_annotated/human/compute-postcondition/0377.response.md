Postcondition: ***`i`, `j + 1`, `k` are all equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined as follows: if `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Subsequently, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` with the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`***.
