Output State: **`i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 based on the conditions. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After executing the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
