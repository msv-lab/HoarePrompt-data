Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, `k` is incremented by 1 (less than or equal to `s - 1`), `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
