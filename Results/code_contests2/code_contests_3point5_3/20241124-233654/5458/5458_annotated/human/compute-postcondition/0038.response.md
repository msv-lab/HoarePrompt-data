Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m is greater than 0, s is greater than or equal to 0, j is 1, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions [2][m+2][s+1], k is incremented by 2. If i == 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i != 0, and j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and then increased by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. The program variables retain their initial values and the updated values in dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] reflect the modifications made during the execution of the if else block.***
