Postcondition: ***`i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is `s + 1`, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modular division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modular division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.***
