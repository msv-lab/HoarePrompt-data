Example Answer: 
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i`, `j`, and `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, the affected variables are `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`, where `s` is an integer, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`, where `s` is an integer, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
