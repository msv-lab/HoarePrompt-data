Example Answer:
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions determined by the values of `m` and `s`. The values of `m` and `s` are not altered by this operation, so they retain their initial values. The elements of `dp` are lists of zeros, with the number of elements in each list determined by the value of `s + 1`. The outer list has `m + 2` elements and the inner lists have `s + 1` elements. The value of `mod` is unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` are integers obtained from splitting the input, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions [2][m+2][s+1].
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` are integers obtained from splitting the input, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions [2][m+2][s+1]**
