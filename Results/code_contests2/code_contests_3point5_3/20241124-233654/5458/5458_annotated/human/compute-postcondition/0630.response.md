Postcondition: ***`i` is 0 or 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `s`, `m`, `mod` are updated based on the conditions. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1. If `i` is 1 and `j > k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
