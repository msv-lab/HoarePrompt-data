Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m is greater than 0, s is greater than or equal to 0, j is 1, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions [2][m+2][s+1], k is incremented by 1. After the execution of the if statement, if j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. All other variables and structures remain unchanged.***
