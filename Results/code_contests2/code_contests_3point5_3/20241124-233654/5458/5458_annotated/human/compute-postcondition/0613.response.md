Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` remains the same as the previous value, `s`, `m`, `mod` are updated according to the conditions, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. The function modifies the state of the variables as described, ensuring that all the mentioned conditions are met.***
