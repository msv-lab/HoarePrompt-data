According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `s` is at least 1, the loop calculates values in the `dp` array based on the conditions provided by the if-else statements. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the variables remain unchanged. `m` is greater than 1**
