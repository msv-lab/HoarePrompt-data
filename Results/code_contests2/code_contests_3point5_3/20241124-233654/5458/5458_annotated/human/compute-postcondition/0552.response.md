Output State: For the updated `dp` array in the next iteration, `i` is not equal to 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][1]` is equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
