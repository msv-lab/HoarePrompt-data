Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, and the values of `j` and `k` are increased by 1 and 0 respectively. Therefore, the output state is: `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`.
Output State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`**
