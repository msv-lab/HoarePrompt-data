Example Answer:
The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. The values of the variables remain the same as the `continue` statement does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is less than `s`, `s`, `m`, `mod` are updated.
Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is less than `s`, `s`, `m`, `mod` are updated**
