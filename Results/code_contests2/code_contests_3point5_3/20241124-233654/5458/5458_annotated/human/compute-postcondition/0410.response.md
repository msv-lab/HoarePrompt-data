Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of the variables are not directly given, so the output state is: No change in the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and `n`. The assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the calculation described.
Output State: **No change in the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and `n`. The assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the calculation described**
