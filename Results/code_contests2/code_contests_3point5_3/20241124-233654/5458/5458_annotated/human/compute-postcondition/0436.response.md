According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`. Before the loop starts, `i` and `j` are within the range of 1 to `m`, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the states need to be adjusted such that `i` and `j` remain within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are preserved.
State: **`i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined**
