According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are all equal to 1, `s` is at least 1. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are already determined as described. `k` is incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to the next value within the range of 1 to `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are all equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` are determined as described.**
