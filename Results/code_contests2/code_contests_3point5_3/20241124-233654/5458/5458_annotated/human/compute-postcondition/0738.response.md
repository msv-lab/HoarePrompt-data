Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the dimensions of `dp` are (2, m + 2, s + 1), the affected variables are `i`, `j`, and `k`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, but the dimensions of `dp` suggest that they are within the specified ranges. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to s.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to s**
