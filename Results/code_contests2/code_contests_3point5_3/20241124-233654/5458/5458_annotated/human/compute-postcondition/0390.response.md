Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are all equal to 1, and the state of `s` is not affected. After execution, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, which is determined elsewhere in the program.
Output State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are all equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined as described**
