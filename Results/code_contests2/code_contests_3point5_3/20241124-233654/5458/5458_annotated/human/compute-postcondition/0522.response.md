Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables and the loop moves to the next iteration.***
