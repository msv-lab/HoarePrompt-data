Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no change occurs in the state. This postcondition ensures that the program maintains the integrity of the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` based on the conditions specified in the code fragment, covering all edge cases.***
