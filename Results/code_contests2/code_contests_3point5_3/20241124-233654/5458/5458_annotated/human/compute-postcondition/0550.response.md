Postcondition: ***For the updated `dp` array in the next iteration, `i` is not equal to 0, `m` is at least 1, and `j` is incremented by 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][1]` is equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the `dp` array.***
