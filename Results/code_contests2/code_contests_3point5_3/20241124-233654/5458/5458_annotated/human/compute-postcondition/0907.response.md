Postcondition: ***`dp` array values are adjusted based on if-else conditions, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program continues without any change in state.***
