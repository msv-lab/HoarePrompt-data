According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s + 1]`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In the else part, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed by taking the modulo of the value at `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then adding the modulo of the value at `[i & 1][j][k - j]`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to be the next value in the range `[1, s + 1]`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s + 1]**
