According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `s`. If `n` is greater than 0 and `s` is within the range of 1 to `s`, the loop will execute. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions are met:
- `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `n` are integers.
- `j + 1` is within the range of 1 to `s`.
- `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and in the last iteration, `k` can reach `s+1`.
- The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined based on the conditions in the loop code.

So for the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` should be greater than 0.
- `s` should be within the range of 1 to `s`.
- `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `n` should remain integers.
- `j + 1` should be within the range of 1 to `s`.
- `k` should be within the range of 1 to `s` and in the last iteration, `k` can reach `s+1`.
- The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be determined based on the conditions in the loop code.

State: **`i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `n` are integers, `j + 1` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` and can reach `s+1`, values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined**.
