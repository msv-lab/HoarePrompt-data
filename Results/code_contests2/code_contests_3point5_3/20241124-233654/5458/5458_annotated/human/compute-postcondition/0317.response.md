According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`, where `s` is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted in the state. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `s`, for the next iteration, `k` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k + 3` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`, where `s` is an integer.**
