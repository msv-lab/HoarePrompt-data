Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, `k` is incremented by 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
