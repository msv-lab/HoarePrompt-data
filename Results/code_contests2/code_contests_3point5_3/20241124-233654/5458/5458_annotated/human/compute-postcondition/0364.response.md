According to the code, the loop can execute if `m` is greater than 0 and `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`. After the loop executes, the conditions mention that `j + 1` should be within the range of 1 to `s` and `k` can reach `s+1` in the last iteration. Based on this information, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and should remain within the range of 1 to `s`.
- `k` should be incremented to reach `s+1`.
- The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` need to be updated based on the loop code.

State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k`, `s`, `n` are integers; `j + 1` is within the range of 1 to `s`; `k` reaches `s+1`; values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined**
