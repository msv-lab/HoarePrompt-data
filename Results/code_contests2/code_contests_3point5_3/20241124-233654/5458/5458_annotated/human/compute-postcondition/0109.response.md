According to the code, the loop will execute at least once if i equals 0 and j is greater than or equal to k. It will continue executing as long as the conditions j > k or j <= m + 1 are met. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop did execute at least once, so the initial condition i equals 0 and j is greater than or equal to k was satisfied. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition j <= m + 1 must be true. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **Adjust `j` to a value such that j <= m + 1**
