Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list containing lists of zeros with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers where `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `s` are integers, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After the execution of the provided code snippet, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is further updated by adding the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulus `mod`.**
