According to the code, the loop will execute indefinitely as it is a `while True` loop. Therefore, the program state at the end of the previous iteration, where `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`, does not need any adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`. The `dp` array is updated based on the specified conditions.**
