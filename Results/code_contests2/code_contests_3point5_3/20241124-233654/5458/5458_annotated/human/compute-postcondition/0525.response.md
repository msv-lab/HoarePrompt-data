Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. If `j` is not greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
