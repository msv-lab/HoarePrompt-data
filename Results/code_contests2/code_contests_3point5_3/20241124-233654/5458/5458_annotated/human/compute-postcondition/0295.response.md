Postcondition: ***`i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is an integer. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The state of the program variables is maintained within the specified ranges and conditions, ensuring proper execution and assignment of values based on the given logic.***
