According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than 0. Since `k` is 1, it meets the condition of being less than or equal to `s`, so the loop can execute one more time. 
State: **`dp` array is updated. `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0**
