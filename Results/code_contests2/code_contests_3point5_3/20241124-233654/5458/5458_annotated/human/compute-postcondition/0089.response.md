At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions are met: `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be updated to the next integer value within the range from 1 to `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i`, `j`, `k+1`, `m`, `s` are integers. If `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1`, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` is set to 1.**
