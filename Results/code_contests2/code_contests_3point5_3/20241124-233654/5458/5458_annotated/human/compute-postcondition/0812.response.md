Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `i` and `j` are integers. If `j` is greater than 2, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and the loop continues. Otherwise, there is no change to the values of the variables.**
