According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `[1, m]`. However, the initial state requires adjusting `s` to be greater than or equal to 1 and adjusting `k` to be within the range `[1, s]` for the loop to execute.

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is within the range `[1, s]`, `j` is within the range `[1, m]`**
