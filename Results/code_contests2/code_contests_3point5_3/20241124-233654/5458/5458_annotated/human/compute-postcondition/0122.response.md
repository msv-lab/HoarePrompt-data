Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, where `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. This covers all possible edge cases and summarizes the postcondition after the execution of the if else block.***
