Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` and `j` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the variables `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
