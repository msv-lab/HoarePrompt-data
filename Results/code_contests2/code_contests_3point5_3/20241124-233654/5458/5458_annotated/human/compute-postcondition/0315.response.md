Output State: **`i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**.
