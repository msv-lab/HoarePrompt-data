Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` maintains its initial condition, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`**
