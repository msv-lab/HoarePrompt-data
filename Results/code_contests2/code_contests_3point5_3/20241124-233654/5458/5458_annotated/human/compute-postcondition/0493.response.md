Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is incremented by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`**
