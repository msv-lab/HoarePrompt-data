Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `s`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0**
