Postcondition: *`i`, `j`, `m`, `k` are integers incremented by 1, `s` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. During the loop execution, `k` is incremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.*
