Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned to 1. The indices `i`, `j`, and `k` are all incremented by 1. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so the output state is: `dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s]`.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s]`**
