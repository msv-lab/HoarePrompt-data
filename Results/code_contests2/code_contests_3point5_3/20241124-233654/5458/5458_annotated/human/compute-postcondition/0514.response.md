Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
