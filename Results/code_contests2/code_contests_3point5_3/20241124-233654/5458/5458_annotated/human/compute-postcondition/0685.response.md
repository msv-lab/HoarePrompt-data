According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers with `n` > 0, `m`, `s` are integers, `j` = 1, `k` = s - 1, and `s` > 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted within the allowed range. 
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers with `n` > 0, `m`, `s` are integers, `j` = 1, `k` = s, and `s` > 0**
