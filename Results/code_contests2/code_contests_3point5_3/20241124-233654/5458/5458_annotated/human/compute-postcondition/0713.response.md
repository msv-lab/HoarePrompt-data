Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so the output state is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is less than s + 1.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is less than s + 1**
