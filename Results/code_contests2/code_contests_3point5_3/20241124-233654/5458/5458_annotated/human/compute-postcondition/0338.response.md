Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, and assuming `dp` is a 3D array, this assignment will copy the value from one index to another. Therefore, the Output State is: i is 1, j is 1, j + 1 is an integer within the range of 1 to s, k is an integer within the range of 1 to s, s is an integer within the range of 1 to s, n is greater than 0, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].
Output State: **i is 1, j is 1, j + 1 is an integer within the range of 1 to s, k is an integer within the range of 1 to s, s is an integer within the range of 1 to s, n is greater than 0, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
