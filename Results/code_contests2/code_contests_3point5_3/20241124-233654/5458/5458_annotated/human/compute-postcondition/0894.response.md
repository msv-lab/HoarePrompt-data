Postcondition: ***`dp` array values are adjusted based on if-else conditions. `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3 (`k`), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases where `i` is not 0 or `j` is not greater than 3 (`k`), the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is determined based on the conditions provided. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value is set to the same as `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, otherwise, it is set to `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Additionally, in the latter case, the value is incremented by the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
