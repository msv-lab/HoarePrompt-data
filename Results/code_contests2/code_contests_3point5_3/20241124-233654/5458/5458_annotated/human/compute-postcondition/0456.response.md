Output State: **`i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.**
