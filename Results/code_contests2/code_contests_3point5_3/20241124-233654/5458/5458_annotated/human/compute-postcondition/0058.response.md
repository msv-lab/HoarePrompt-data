Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k+1` are integers. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` is set to 1. In all other cases where `i` is not equal to 0, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` are determined based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k+1]`, which is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k+1] % mod`, and further incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k+1 - j] % mod`. Additionally, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m + 1` and `k+1` should be greater than 0 and less than or equal to `s`.**
