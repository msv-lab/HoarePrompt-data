Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
