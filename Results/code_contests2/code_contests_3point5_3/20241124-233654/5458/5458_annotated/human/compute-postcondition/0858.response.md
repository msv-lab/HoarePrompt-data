According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `s` in order to satisfy the loop condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`**
