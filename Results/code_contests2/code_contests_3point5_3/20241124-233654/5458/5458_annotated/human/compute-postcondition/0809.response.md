Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `i` and `j` are integers.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `i` and `j` are integers**
