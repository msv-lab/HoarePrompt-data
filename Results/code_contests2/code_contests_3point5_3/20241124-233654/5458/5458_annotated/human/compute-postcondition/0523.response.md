Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no change in the values of the variables and the loop moves to the next iteration.**
