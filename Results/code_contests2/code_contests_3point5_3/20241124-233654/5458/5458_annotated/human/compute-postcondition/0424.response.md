Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly given, but based on the code logic, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is copied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, `k` is incremented by 1 (less than or equal to `s - 1`), and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, `k` is incremented by 1 (less than or equal to `s - 1`), and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
