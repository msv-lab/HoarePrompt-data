Postcondition: ***`dp` array values are adjusted based on the if-else conditions. The values of `m`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is set to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` in `dp`. The loop continues without any changes to the variables. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no modifications are made to the `dp` array or any other variables. Overall, the program maintains the integrity of the `dp` array and the initial values of `m`, `k`, and `s` are preserved.***
