According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to s + 1. Since `k` ranges from 1 to s + 1, the loop can execute again with `k` being less than or equal to s. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to s**
