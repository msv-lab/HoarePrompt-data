According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `k` (incremented by 1), `s` (unchanged)**
