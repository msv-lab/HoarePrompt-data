Postcondition: ***`i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are all equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` are determined as described. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. For all other cases where `i` is not 0 or `j` is not greater than `k`, the values of the variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is updated based on the given calculations. The postcondition ensures the correct assignment of values to `dp` for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`, covering all edge cases and scenarios.***
