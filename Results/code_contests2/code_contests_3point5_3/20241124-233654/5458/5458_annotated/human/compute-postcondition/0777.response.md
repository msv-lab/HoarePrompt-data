Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k` are all integers meeting the specified constraints, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is assigned the value of the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` in `dp`, and the loop continues. All other elements in `dp` remain unchanged.***
