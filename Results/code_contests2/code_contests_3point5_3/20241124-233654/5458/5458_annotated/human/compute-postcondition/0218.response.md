According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is at least 1. `k` is iterating from 1 to `s`, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is 1. And since `j` is not used in the loop, it can remain within the range `[1, m]`.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is within the range `[1, m]**
