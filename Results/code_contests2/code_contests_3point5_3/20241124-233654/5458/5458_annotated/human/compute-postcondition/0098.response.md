According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k+1` needs to be within the range of 1 to `s+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i`, `j`, `k+1`, `m`, `s` are integers. If `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1`, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j >= k`. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod**`.
