Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m is greater than 0, s is greater than or equal to 0, j is 1, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions [2][m+2][s+1], k is incremented by 2. If j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. The program variables maintain their initial conditions and the assignment of 1 to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is the only change after the execution of the if statement.***
