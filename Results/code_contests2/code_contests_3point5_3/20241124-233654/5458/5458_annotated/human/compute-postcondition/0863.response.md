According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the values in the `dp` array need to be adjusted based on the conditions provided by the if-else statements. To ensure the integrity of the variables and indexes, the adjustment should reflect the conditions specified in the if-else statements.
State: **Adjust the values in `dp` array based on the conditions provided by the if-else statements, `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
