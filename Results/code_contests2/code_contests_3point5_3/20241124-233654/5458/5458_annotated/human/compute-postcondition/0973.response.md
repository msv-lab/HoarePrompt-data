Functionality: **The function `func` continuously reads input values for positive integers n, m, and s, updating the `dp` array based on specific conditions. The loop runs indefinitely until n, m, and s are all 0, at which point it breaks. The final output printed is the modulo of `dp[n` squared `& 1][m + 1][s]`. The function does not handle cases where the input values could lead to division by zero errors or invalid inputs.**
