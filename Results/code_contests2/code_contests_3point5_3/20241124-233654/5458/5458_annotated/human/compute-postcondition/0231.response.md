According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. Since `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is within the range `[1, m]`, `i` is an integer**
