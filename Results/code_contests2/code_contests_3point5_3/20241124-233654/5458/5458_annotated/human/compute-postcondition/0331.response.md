According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute, `k` should be within the range of 1 to `s`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `j + 1` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`, `k` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`, `n` is greater than 0**
