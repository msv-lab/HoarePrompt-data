Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Since `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the other variables are not affected, the output state is: `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `n` is an appropriate integer, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
