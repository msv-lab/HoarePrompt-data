Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All other variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships, covering all possible edge cases and scenarios.***
