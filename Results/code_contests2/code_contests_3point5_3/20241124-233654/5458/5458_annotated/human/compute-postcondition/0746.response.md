Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to s+1. If j is greater than or equal to k, then the element at index [1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. This assignment covers all possible edge cases and scenarios within the given range of values for the variables involved.***
