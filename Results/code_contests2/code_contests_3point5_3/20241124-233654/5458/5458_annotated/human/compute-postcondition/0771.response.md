Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k` are all integers meeting the specified constraints. The program fragment ensures that if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is updated to 1. If `j` is larger than `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The program effectively handles all edge cases and maintains the integrity of the variables and indexes as specified.***
