Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i` and `j` are unknown, but `k` is 3. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` and `j` are integers, and the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` and `j` are integers, and the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
