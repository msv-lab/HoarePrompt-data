Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, where `i`, `j`, and `k` are variables. The current value of `k` is 2. Since bitwise AND operation is applied to `i + 1` and 1, the result will be 0 if `i` is even and 1 if `i` is odd. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` array is updated, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`dp` array is updated, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0**
