Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k` are all integers meeting the specified constraints, `k` is incremented by 1, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` in the `dp` list.**
