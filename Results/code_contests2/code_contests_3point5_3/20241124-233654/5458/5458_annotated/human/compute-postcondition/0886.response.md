According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. In this case, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `k`, which needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp` array values are adjusted based on if-else conditions, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**.
