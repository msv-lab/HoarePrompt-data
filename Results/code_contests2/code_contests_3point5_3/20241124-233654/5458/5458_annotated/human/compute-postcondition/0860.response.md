According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`, `m`, and `k`. If `s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, and `k` is a positive integer, the loop will calculate values in the `dp` array. At the end of the last iteration, if `s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, and `k` is a positive integer, the loop executed. So for the loop to execute one more time, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, and `k` is a positive integer.
State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, and `k` is a positive integer**
