Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k + 1` are all integers meeting the specified constraints. After the if statement executes, the element at index (i + 1) % 2, j + 1, k in dp is assigned the value 1 if j >= k. All other elements remain unchanged.***
