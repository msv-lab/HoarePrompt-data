According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` being an integer obtained from splitting the input does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0 and `m` and `s` are integers obtained from splitting the input as well. Additionally, `dp` being a 2D list of zeros with dimensions [2][m+2][s+1] should be included in the state adjustment.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers obtained from splitting the input, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions [2][m+2][s+1]**
