Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of dividing the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`, and then incremented by the remainder of dividing the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.***
