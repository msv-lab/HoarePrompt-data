According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be within the range of 1 to `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined**
