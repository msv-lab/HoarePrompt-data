Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 2 and `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or retains its initial value, and `j` equals `m + 2`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is strictly greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to have the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then added to the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
