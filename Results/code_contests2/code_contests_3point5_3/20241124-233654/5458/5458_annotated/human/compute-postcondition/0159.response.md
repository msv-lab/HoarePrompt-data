Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated based on the given conditions, `i` is less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the first value in the range `[1, s]`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. For all other cases where `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Additionally, in the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. All boundary values and relationships between variables are correctly handled, ensuring the correct state of the program variables after the execution of the if else block.***
