Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i` and `j` are updated by adding 1 and `k` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: For the updated `dp` array in the next iteration, `i` is an integer updated based on the conditions, `j` is an integer updated based on the conditions, `m` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **For the updated `dp` array in the next iteration, `i` is an integer updated based on the conditions, `j` is an integer updated based on the conditions, `m` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1**
