According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m` and `s`. If `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dp` array values have been adjusted based on if-else conditions, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
1. If `m` is greater than 1, then `m` should be adjusted to `m + 1` to ensure the loop can execute again.
2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` array values are adjusted based on if-else conditions, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
