According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is less than s + 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration. Since `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, the next value of `k` after the last iteration should be `s + 1`. 

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is s + 1**
