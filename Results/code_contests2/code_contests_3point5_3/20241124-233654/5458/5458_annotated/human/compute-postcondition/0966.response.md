Output State: 
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is between 1 and `s`
- `s` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` either maintains its initial condition or is 0
- `j` ranges from 2 to `m + 1` after each iteration

After the loop executes:
- If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j <= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then added to the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

Cases where the loop does not execute:
- If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute.
- If the initial condition of `m` or `s` prevents the loop from entering, the loop will not execute, and `dp` values will remain unchanged.
