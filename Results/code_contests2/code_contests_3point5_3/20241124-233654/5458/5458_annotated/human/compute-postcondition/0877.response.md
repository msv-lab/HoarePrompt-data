According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Based on the given conditions, `k` being 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` array values are adjusted based on if-else conditions, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
