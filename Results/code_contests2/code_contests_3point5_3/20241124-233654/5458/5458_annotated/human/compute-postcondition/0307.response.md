Postcondition: ***`i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`, where `s` is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. In all other cases, if `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
