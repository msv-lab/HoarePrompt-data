Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s` are integers with values satisfying `j` < `m`, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. `k` is an integer with value 1, `i` is an integer with value 0 if the if part is executed, otherwise `i` is an integer with value different than 0. `n` remains unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variables maintain their initial conditions with the specified updates based on the conditions met within the if else block.***
