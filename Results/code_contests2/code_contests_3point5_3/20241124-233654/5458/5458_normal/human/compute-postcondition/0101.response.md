Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, but the values in the initial state meet the conditions for the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `s`, `m`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j + 1` are integers, meeting the conditions for the next iteration.
Output State: **`s`, `m`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j + 1` are integers, meeting the conditions for the next iteration**
