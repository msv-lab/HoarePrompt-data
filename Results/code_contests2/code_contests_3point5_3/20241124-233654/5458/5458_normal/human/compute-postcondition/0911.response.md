According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `j + 1` is greater than 1 and `j + 1` is greater than `k`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted such that it is less than or equal to `s` and `k + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`.**
