Output State: 
If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is less than or equal to `s`, then after the loop executes at least once:
- If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1.
- If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is strictly greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.
- `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` will be adjusted according to the specified conditions for the next iteration.

If `j + 1` is greater than `m`, the loop will not execute, and the values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` will remain unchanged.
