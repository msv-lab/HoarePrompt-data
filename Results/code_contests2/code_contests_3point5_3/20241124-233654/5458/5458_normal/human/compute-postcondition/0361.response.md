Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` maintain their initial values and relationships; `n` is greater than 0. The 2D list `dp` is properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i != 0` and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If neither condition is met, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if-else block.***
