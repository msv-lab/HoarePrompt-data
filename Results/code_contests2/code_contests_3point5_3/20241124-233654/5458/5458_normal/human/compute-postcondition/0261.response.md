Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated, i is not equal to 0, if j is greater than k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. All other variables remain unchanged in this condition. The postcondition covers the scenario where j is greater than k and ensures that all variables retain their initial conditions except for the modification of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` as described.***
