Postcondition: ***All variables maintain their initial conditions after the loop executes, except `j` which is now less than `m`, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and the loop continues. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
