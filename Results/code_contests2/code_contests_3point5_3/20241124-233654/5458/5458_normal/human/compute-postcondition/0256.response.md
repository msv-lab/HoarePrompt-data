Postcondition: ***`j` is 3, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][1]` is updated, `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, reflecting the updated state of the program variables after the execution of the if statement.***
