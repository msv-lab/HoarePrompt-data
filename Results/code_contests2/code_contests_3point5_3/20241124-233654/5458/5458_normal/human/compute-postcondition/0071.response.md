Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are affected by the calculation. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **Variables `k`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `mod` remain unchanged.**
