Output State: **If `s` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes:
- When `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
- When `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.
- If `s` is 0, the loop won't execute and the values of all variables remain unchanged.**
