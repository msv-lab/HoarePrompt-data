Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` are variables adjusted accordingly based on the specified conditions for the next iteration. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program skips the current iteration and continues to the next iteration without modifying any variables. No changes are made to the variables `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` after the execution of the if-else block.***
