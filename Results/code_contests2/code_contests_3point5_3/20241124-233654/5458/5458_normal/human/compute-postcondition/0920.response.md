According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be updated to `k + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s**`.
