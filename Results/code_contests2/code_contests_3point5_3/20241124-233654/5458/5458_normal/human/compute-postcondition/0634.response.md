Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since there is no information provided on the initial values of `i`, `j`, or `k`, the output state is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is updated to `k + 1**
