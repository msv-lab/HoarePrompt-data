Postcondition: ***All variables maintain their initial conditions after the loop executes, except `j` which is now less than `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with respect to `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with respect to `mod`.***
