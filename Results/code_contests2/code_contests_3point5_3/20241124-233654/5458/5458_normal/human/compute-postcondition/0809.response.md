Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, but the values of `s`, `mod`, and `m` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j`, `mod`, `m` are integers, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.
Output State: **`s`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j`, `mod`, `m` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k**.
