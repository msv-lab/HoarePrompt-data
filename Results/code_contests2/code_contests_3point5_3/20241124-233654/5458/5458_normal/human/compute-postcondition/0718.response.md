Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` are all 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is 3. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by performing modular arithmetic on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
