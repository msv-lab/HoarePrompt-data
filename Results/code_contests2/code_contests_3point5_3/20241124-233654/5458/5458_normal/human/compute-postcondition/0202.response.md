Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` are adjusted according to the specified conditions for the next iteration. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is strictly greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. All other variables maintain their initial states after the execution of the if-else block.***
