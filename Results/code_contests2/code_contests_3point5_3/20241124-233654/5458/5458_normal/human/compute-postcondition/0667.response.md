According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be updated to be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is 0 or 1, dp state remains the same**
