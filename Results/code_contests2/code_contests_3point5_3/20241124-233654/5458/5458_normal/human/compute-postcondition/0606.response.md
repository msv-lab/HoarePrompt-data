According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted to allow the loop to execute one more time:

1. `k + 1` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next value of `k`.
2. If `k + 1` becomes equal to `s`, then `k` should be updated to `s` to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i`, `n` are integers satisfying `j` < `m`, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. `k + 1` is an integer less than `s`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i == 0` and `j < k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `i != 0` and `j <= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. `k` is incremented by 1.**
