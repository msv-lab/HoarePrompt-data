According to the code, the loop can execute again if `s` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `n` have their initial values. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` becomes equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. In this case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. Moreover, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.

To execute one more time, the condition `s` greater than 0 should hold true for the loop to continue. No other states need to be adjusted.
