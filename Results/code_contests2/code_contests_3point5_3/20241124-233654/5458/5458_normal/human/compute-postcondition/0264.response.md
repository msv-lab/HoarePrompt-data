Postcondition: ***`j` is an integer with a minimum value of 2, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to 1, `i` is less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
