According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the initial conditions. At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Since the loop executes as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `j` such that it is less than `m`.
State: **All variables maintain their initial conditions after the loop executes, except `j` which is now less than `m**.
