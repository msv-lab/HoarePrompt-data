Output State: **If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` mod `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` mod `mod`. The loop will not execute if `s` is less than 1 or if `j` is already greater than or equal to `m`.**
