According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are already maintained, and `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned based on the input. The 2D list `dp` is initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. So, for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` maintain their initial values and relationships, `n` is greater than 0, 2D list `dp` is initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`**
