Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. The previous values of the variables are not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `mod` remain the same as before, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`k`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `mod` remain the same as before, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly**
