According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3. To execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 4, `i` can be any value**
