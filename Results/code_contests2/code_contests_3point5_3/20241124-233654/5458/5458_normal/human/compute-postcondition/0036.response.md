Output State: **`k` is incremented by 1, all other states remain the same. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.**
