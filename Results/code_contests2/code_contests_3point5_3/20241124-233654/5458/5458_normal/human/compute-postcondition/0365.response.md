According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` reaches the value of `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented beyond `s`. 
State: **`j` is greater than `m`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code, `k` is greater than `s`**
