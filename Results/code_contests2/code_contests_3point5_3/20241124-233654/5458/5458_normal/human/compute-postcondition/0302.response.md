Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `k` is within the range [1, `s`]. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, `k` is within the range [1, `s`].
Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, `k` is within the range [1, `s`]**
