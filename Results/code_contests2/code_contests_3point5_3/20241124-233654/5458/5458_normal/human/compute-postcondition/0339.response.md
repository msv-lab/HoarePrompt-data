Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `n` maintain their initial values and relationships. `n` is greater than 0. 2D list `dp` is properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`. The value of  `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
