Output State: **`j + 1`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1. `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` and `j` maintain their initial values and relationships as described. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `k` is greater than `s`, the loop does not execute, and no changes are made to the variables.**
