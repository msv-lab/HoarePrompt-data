Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i` and `j` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j + 1`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1. `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` and `j` maintain their initial values and relationships, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`j + 1`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1. `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` and `j` maintain their initial values and relationships, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
