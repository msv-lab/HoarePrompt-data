Postcondition: ***`s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, where `k` is less than or equal to `s`. In the if part, if `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. In the else part, if `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, the variables maintain their initial values and relationships, ensuring the program state remains consistent with the specified ranges and initial conditions.***
