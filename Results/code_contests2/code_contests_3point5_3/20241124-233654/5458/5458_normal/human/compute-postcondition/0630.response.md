Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is 2. After the execution of the if-else block, if `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, if `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes occur to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
