Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is an integer with a minimum value of 2, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to the next value, `i` is less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1.
Output State: **`j` is an integer with a minimum value of 2, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to the next value, `i` is less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1**
