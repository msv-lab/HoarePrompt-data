Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s`, the loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than `s`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `n` are integers satisfying `j` < `m`, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. `k` is an integer less than `s`. `i` is an integer that is 0 if the if part is executed, otherwise `i` is a non-zero integer. 

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `k` should be incremented by 1 to continue iterating through the range `1` to `s`.

State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i`, `n` are integers satisfying `j` < `m`, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. `k + 1` is an integer less than `s`**
