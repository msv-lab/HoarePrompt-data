Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`***. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases after the if-else block executes.
