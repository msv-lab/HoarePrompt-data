Example Answer:
The `continue` statement is encountered, which skips the rest of the code in the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since there is no loop provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement has no effect. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`s`, `k + 2`, `i`, `j`, `mod`, `m` are integers**
