According to the code, the loop will execute at least once if `s` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `m` is greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0 and `m` is greater than 1. 
State: **`s` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 1**
