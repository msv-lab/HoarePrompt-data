Postcondition: ***`s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` becomes `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
