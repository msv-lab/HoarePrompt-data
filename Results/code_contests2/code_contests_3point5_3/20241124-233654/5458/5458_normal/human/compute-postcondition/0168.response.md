Postcondition: ***`j + 1`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1. `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` and `j` maintain their initial values and relationships as described. After the execution of the if-else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the following conditions: if `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` added with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases ensuring the correct state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block.***
