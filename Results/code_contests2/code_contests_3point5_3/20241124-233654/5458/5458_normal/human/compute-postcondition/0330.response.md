According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `i` maintain their initial values and relationships, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, the 2D list `dp` must be properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s` for the loop to execute. 
State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` maintain their initial values and relationships, `n` is greater than 0, 2D list `dp` is properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`**
