Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are adjusted to the next value in the range `1` to `s + 1`, `i` and `n` have their initial values. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of dividing the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.**
