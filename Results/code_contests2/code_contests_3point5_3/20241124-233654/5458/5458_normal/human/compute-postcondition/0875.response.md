Output State: **`s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `k` is 1, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `j` is greater than 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program execution continues. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After executing the code snippet, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the sum of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
