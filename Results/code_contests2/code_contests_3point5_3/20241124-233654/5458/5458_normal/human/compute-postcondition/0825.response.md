Output State: 
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. 
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. 
- Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 
- All variables `s`, `k`, `i`, `j`, `mod`, `m` maintain their initial conditions after the loop executes.

- If the initial conditions are such that the loop does not execute, all variables remain the same as their initial values.
