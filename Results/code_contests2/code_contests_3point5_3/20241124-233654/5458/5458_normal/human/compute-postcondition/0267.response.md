Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `n` are integers. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. The minimum value of `j` is 2, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to the next value, `i` is less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1.***
