According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states to ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` have their initial values and `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` have their initial values, `i` and `n` remain unchanged**
