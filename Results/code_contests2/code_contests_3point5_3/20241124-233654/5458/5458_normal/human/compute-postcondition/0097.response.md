Postcondition: ***`s`, `m`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, if `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is first set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
