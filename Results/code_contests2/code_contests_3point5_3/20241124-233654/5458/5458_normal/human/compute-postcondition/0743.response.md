Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. For all other cases where `i` is not 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is then updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. All scenarios regarding the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are considered to ensure the loop functions correctly.***
