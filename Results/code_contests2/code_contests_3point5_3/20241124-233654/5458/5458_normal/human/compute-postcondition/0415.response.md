Example Answer:
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` and `k` are integers, `m` remains unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains 0.
Output State: **`j` and `k` are integers, `m` remains unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains 0**
