Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `n` are integers where `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k`, `i`, and `n` are the same, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
