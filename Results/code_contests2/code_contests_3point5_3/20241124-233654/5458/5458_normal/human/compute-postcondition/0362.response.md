According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` was updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` maintain their initial values and relationships; `n` is greater than 0. The 2D list `dp` is properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s + 1`.**
