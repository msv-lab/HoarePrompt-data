Postcondition: ***`s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k`, `mod`, `m` are integers where `s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are 1 and `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `mod`, and `m`. `mod` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `j + 1` is greater than 1, `j + 1` is greater than `k`, and `j` is greater than `k`. If `j > k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
