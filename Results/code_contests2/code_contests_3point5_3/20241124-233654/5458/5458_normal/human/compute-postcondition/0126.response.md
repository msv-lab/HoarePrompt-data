In order for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `k` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, the next iteration would require `k` to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `i` can be any value**
