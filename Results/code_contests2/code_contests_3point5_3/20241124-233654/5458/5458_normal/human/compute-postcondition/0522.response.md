Postcondition: ***`j`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, the values of `j` and `k` are updated based on the conditions in the code snippet for the next iteration, while `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Otherwise, there are no changes in the values of the variables.***
