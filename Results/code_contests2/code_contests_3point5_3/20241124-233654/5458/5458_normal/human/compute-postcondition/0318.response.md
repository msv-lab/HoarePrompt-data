Output State: **All variables `j`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. `k` is within the range [1, `s`]. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Subsequently, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `k` is less than 1 or `i` is less than 0, the loop does not execute and `dp` remains unchanged.**
