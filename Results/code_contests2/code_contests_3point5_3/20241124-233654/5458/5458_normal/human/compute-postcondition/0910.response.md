Postcondition: ***`s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `k` is less than or equal to `s`. `j + 1` is greater than 1 and `j + 1` is greater than `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned in the else part. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the correct assignment of values after the execution of the program fragment.***
