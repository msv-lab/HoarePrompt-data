According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows: `j` is equal to `m`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `n` remain the same. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to less than `m`.
State: **`j` is less than `m`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `n` remain the same**
