Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, all variables `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k + 1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k + 1]`. If `j` is not greater than `k + 1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k + 1]` by `mod` and adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k + 1 - j]` by `mod`. After incrementing `k` by 1, all variables maintain their correct states with necessary adjustments made to `k` and corresponding updates to the `dp` array. All edge cases and boundary values are accounted for in the postcondition.***
