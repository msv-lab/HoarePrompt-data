Postcondition: ***`k` is the next value within the range 1 to `s`, `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `mod` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution continues. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases for the if-else block.***
