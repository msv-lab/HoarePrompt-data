Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `n` are integers. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. If `i > 0` and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i > 0` and `j <= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, then added to the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The minimum value of `j` is 2, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to the next value, `i` is less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.***
