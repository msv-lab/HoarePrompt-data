Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is either 0 or 1, dp state remains the same. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If `j` is not greater than `k` in the else part, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the modulo of the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and added to the modulo of the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j].***
