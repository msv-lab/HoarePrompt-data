Output State: **`s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After executing the provided code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.**
