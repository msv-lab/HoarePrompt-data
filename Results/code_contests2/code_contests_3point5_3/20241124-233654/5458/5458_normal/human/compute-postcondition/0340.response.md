Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `n` maintain their initial values and relationships. `n` is greater than 0. 2D list `dp` is properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the values.***
