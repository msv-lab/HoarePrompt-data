According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j`, `mod`, `m` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
