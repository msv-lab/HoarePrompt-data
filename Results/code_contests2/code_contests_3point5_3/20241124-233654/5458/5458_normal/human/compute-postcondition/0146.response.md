According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, the variables `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `i` maintain their initial values and relationships. The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions within the loop.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If the loop executes one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **Output State: `j + 1`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `i` maintain their initial values and relationships as described.**
