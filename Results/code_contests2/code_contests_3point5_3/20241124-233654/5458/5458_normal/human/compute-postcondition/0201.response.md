Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: No changes are made to the variables `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` after the execution of the if-else block.
Output State: **No changes are made to the variables `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` after the execution of the if-else block.**
