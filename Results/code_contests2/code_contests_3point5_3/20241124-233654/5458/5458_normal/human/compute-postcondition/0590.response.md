Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s` are integers such that `j` < `m`, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. `k` is an integer less than `s`. `i` is an integer that is 0 if the if part is executed, otherwise `i` is a non-zero integer. `n` remains unchanged. After the execution of the if part, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.***
