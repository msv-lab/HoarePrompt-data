According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s`, `m`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j + 1` meet the conditions for the next iteration. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. No other states need adjustment based on the given conditions.

State: **`s`, `m`, `k + 2`, `i`, `j + 1` are integers meeting the conditions for the next iteration**
