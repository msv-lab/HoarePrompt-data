Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than `s`, `i` and `n` are integers where `i`, `k`, and `n` are the same. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is greater than `k` but `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
