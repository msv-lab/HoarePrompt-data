Output State: **`j, m, s, i, n` remain unchanged. `k` is within the range [1, s] and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After the operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is performed.**
