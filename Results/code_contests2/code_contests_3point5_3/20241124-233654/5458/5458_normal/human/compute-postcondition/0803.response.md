Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i`, `j`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. Furthermore, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
