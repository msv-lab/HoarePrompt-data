Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `n` are all equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. No other changes are made to the variables `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `n` after the execution of the if else block.***
