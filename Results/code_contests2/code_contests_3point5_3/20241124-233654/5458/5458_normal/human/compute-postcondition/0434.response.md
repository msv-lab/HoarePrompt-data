According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `s` and `n`. If `s` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `n` remain as per their initial relationships. The 2D list `dp` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `s` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. Therefore, adjust `s` to be greater than 0.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `n` remain the same, `s` is greater than 0**
