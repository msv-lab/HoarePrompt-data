Postcondition: ***All variables `j`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. `k` is within the range [1, `s`]. After the execution of the if-else block, the array `dp` is updated based on the conditions. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues. In the other case where `j` is not greater than `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of the modulo of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the modulo of the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The program ensures that `k` remains within the specified range and accurately updates the array values based on the conditions mentioned, covering all possible edge cases.***
