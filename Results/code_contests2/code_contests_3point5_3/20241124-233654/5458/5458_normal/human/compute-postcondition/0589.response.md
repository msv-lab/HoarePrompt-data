Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s` are integers with values satisfying `j` < `m`, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. `k` is an integer with value less than `s`, `i` is an integer with value 0 if the if part is executed, otherwise `i` is an integer with value different than 0. `n` remains unchanged. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.**
