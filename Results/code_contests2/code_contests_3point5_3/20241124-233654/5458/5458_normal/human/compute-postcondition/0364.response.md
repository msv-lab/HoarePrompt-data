According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` ranges from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` reaches the value of `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented beyond `m`.
State: **`j` is greater than `m`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code.
