Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `j`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. `k` is within the range [1, `s` + 1]. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. 
Output State: **All variables `j`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. `k` is within the range [1, `s` + 1]. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
