Output State: **All variables maintain their initial conditions after the loop executes, except `j` which is now less than `m`, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, after updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, the final value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, the loop will not execute.**
