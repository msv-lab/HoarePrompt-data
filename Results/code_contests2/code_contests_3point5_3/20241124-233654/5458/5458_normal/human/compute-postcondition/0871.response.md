Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not changed by this assignment statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `k` is 1, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `j` is greater than 1. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `k` is 1, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `j` is greater than 1. `j` is greater than `k`**
