Output State: **`j` is less than `m`, `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` and `n` remain the same, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
