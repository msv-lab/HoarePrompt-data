Postcondition: ***All variables maintain their initial conditions after the loop executes, except `j` which is now less than `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than `m, i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues.***
