Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The conditions state that `j` is now less than `m`, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. All other variables maintain their initial conditions. Since the assignment does not change the values of other variables, the output state is: All variables maintain their initial conditions after the loop executes, except `j` which is now less than `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than `m`.
Output State: **All variables maintain their initial conditions after the loop executes, except `j` which is now less than `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than `m`**
