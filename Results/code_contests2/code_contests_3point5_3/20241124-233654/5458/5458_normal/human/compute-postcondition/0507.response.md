Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is 0, `j` and `k` have their initial values, and `n` remains unchanged, the output state is: `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` have their initial values, `i` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` have their initial values, `i` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
