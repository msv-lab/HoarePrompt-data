Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` maintain their initial values and relationships, `n` is greater than 0, 2D list `dp` is properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. All other variables and relationships remain unchanged after the execution of the program fragment.***
