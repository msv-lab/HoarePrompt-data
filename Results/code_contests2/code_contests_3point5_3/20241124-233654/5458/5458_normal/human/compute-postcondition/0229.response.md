Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is less than `n`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated, i is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
