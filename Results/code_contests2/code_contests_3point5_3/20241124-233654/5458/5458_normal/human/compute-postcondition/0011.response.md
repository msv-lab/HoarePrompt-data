Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i is 0, j is greater than or equal to k, and k is 1, the new value is assigned to dp[1][j + 1][1]. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: k is 1, n and m are greater than or equal to 1, s is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, j is greater than or equal to k, and dp[1][j + 1][1] is 1.
Output State: **k is 1, n and m are greater than or equal to 1, s is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, j is greater than or equal to k, and dp[1][j + 1][1] is 1**
