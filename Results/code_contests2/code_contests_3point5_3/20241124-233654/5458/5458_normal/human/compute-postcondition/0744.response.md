According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. So, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**
