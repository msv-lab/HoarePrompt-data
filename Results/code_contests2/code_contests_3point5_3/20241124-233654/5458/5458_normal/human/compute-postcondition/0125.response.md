Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` can be any value. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then after the execution of the program fragment, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. In all other cases, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions described in the program fragment.***
