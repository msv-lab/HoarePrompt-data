According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than or equal to 1, but we need to adjust the states to ensure the loop executes. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted to `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1.
State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
