Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` have their initial values. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. The values of `j` and `k` have been updated based on the conditions in the code snippet for the next iteration, while `i` and `n` remain unchanged.***
