Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is updated to `k + 1`, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the remainder of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] divided by `mod`.**
