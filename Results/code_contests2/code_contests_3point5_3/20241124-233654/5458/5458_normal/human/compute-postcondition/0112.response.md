According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is not mentioned so we will not consider it. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `j` is now 1 and `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
