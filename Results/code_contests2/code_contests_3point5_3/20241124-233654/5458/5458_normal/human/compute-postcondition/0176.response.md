Output State: **`j + 1`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1. `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` and `j` maintain their initial values and relationships. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.**
