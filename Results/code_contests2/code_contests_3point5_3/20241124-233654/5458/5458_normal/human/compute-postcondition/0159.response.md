Postcondition: ***`j + 1`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1. `k` and `i` maintain their initial values and relationships as described. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the dynamic programming array `dp` at index `i + 1` of the second dimension, `j + 1` of the third dimension, and `k` of the fourth dimension is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. Additionally, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod` to the previously calculated value.***
