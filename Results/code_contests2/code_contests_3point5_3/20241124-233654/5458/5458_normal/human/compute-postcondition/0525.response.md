Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` have their initial values. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases, the values of `j` and `k` are updated based on the conditions in the code snippet for the next iteration. Additionally, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is determined by specific calculations involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. `i` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the execution of the program.***
