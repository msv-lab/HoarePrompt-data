According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `n` are all equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than `s + 1`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` is less than `s + 1`, `i`, `n` are all equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0**
