Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known integers. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `m`, `dp`, `k + 2`, `s`, `i` are integers, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`j`, `m`, `dp`, `k + 2`, `s`, `i` are integers, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**.
