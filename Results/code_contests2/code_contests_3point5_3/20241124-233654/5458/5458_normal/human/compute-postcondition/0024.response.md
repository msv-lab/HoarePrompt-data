Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned, so their values remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is the next integer value, `n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `mod` is 100000, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`k` is the next integer value, `n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `mod` is 100000, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
