Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Given that n, m, s, j+1, k are 1, and i is an integer not equal to 0, and j is greater than k, the output state is: n, m, s, j+1, k are 1, i is an integer not equal to 0, j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].
Output State: **n, m, s, j+1, k are 1, i is an integer not equal to 0, j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
