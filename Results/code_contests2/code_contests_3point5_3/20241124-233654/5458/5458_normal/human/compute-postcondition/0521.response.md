Example Answer: 
The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `j` and `k` are updated based on the condition in the code snippet for the next iteration. The variables `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`j` and `k` have updated values based on the condition in the code snippet for the next iteration, while `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
