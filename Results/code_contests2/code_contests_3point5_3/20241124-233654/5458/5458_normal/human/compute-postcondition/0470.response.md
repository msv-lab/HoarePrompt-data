According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `j` is incremented by 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is now 1, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, and `n` is 0.
State: **`j` is 1, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is 0**
