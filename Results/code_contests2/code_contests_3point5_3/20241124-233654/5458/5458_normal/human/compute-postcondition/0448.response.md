Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `n` are all equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
