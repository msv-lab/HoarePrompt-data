Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0 or 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is 1, `j` is less or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
