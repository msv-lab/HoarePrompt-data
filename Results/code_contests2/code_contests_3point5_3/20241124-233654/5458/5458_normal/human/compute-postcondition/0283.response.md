According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are updated to the next value and `i` is less than `n`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then certain operations are performed on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are updated to the next value, `i` is less than `n`**
