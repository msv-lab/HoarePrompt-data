According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since `k` is currently 1 and less than `s`, it can be incremented by 1 to continue the loop.
State: **`j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `i` is less than `n`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated**
