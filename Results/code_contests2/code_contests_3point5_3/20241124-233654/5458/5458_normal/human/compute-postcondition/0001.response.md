Example Answer:
`n, m, s` are assigned values by splitting the input based on spaces. The values of `n, m, s` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ s ≤ 3000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, s` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ s ≤ 3000; mod is 100000.
Output State: **`n, m, s` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ s ≤ 3000; mod is 100000**
