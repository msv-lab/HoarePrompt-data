Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than `s`, `i` and `n` are integers where `i`, `k`, and `n` are the same. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program continues execution without changing any other variables, maintaining the initial state of all other variables as described in the precondition.***
