Output State: 
- After the loop executes, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run. 
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. 
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. 
- In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be calculated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 
- If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and all variables will retain their initial values.
