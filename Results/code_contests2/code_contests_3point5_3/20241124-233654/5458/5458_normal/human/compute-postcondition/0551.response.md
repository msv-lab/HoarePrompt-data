Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k`, `i`, and `n` remain the same. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program continues execution without any further changes.**
