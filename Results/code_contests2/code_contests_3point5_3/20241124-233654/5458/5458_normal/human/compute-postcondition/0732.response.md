Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
