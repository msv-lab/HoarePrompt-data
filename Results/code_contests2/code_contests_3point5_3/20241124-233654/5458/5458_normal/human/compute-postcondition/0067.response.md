Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is the next value within the range 1 to `s`, `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `mod` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`k` is the next value within the range 1 to `s`, `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `mod` remains unchanged**
