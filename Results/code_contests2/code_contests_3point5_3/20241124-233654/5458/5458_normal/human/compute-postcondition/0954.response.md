According to the provided code snippet, the loop's execution depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, the variables have the following values: `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases, including when `i != 0` and `j <= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` or updated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.
State: **`s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1.**
