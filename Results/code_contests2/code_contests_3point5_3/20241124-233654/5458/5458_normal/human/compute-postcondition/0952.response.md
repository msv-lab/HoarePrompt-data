Example Answer:
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo operation of dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. If j is greater than k, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, and the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the conditions mentioned above.**
