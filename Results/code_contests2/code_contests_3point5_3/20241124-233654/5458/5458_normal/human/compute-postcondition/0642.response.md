According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` remains greater than or equal to 1, `j` remains less than `m`, and `k` is updated up to `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `m` at the end of the previous iteration. This means `j` should be less than `m + 1` for the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` remains greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m + 1`, `k` is updated up to `s`**
