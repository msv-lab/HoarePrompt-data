Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `&` represents the bitwise AND operation. The previous values of variables are maintained, and `k` is updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `m`, `s`, and `k` maintain their initial values and relationships; `n` is greater than 0; the 2D list `dp` is properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`; `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s + 1`.
Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, and `k` maintain their initial values and relationships; `n` is greater than 0; the 2D list `dp` is properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`; `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s + 1`**
