Postcondition: ***`i`, `n`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` becomes equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. In this case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. All variables are adjusted to the next value in the range 1 to `s + 1` after the execution of the if else block.***
