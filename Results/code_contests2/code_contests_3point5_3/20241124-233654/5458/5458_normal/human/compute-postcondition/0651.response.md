Example Answer:
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions based on the values of `m` and `s`. The inner lists are filled with zeros. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are not used in this code snippet, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers representing the updated user input values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers representing the updated user input values**
