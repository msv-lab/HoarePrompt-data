According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `j` is 2 does not affect the loop execution but `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. 
State: **`j` is 2, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated**
