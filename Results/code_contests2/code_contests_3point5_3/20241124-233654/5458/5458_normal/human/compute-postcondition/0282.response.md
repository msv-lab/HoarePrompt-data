Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are updated to the next value, `i` is less than `n`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the result of the modulo operation between the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `mod`, and then increased by the modulo operation between the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and `mod`.***
