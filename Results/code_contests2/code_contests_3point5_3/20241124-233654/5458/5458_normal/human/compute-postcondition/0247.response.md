Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` is less than `n`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are updated. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
