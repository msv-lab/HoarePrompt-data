Output State: **If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is 1 and `j <= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
