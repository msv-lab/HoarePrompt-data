According to the code, the loop will execute at least once if `s` is greater than 0. Therefore, if the loop is to execute again, we need to ensure that `s` is greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` were provided based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since `i`, `j`, and `k` are not mentioned to be adjusted for the next iteration, we can leave them unchanged.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `s`, which must be greater than 0.
State: **`s` is greater than 0, `m`, `k`, `i`, `j` are integers**
