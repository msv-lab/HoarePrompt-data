Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The values of `i` and `j` are maintained, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`j + 1`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1. `k` is less than or equal to `s`. The initial values and relationships of `i` and `j` are maintained throughout.**
