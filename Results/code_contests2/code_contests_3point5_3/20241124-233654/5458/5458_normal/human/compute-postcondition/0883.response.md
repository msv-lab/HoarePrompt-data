Output State: **`s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, where `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. All other variables retain their initial values and relationships.**
