According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` are all 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is 3.

1. Since `k` is currently 1, it needs to be updated to 2 for the loop to execute one more time.
2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` are all 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is 2**
