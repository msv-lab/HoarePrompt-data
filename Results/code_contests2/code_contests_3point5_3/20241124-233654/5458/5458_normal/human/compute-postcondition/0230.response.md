Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is less than `n`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the modulo operation of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
