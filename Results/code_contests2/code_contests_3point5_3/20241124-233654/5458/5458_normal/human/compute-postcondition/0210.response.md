Example Answer:
If j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. In all other cases where j is less than or equal to k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` are adjusted according to the specified conditions for the next iteration.**
