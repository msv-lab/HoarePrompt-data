Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, `i` can be any value. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the sum of `(dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod)` and `(dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod)`. In all cases, the variables maintain their initial values and the relationships described in the precondition.***
