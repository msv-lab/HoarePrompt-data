Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `n` are all equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
