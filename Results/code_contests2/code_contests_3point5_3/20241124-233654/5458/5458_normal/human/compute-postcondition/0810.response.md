Example Answer: 
The `continue` statement does not change the state of the variables. It simply skips the rest of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`s`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j`, `mod`, `m` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k**
