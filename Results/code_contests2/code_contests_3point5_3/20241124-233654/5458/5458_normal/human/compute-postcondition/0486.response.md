Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `j`, `m`, `s`, and `k` are adjusted to the next value in the range `1` to `s + 1`, and `i` and `n` retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are adjusted to the next value in the range `1` to `s + 1`, `i` and `n` have their initial values.
Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are adjusted to the next value in the range `1` to `s + 1`, `i` and `n` have their initial values**
