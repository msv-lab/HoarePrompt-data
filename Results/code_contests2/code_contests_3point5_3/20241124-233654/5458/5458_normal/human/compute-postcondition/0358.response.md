Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` maintain their initial values and relationships; `n` is greater than 0; the 2D list `dp` is properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`; `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value in the 2D list `dp` at position `i + 1 & 1` and indices `j + 1` and `k` remains the same as the value at position `i + 1 & 1` and indices `j` and `k`.***
