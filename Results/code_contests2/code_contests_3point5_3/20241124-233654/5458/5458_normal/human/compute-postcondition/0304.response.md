Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. `k` is within the range [1, `s`]. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables or array indices. The program ensures that `k` remains within the specified range and updates the array values accordingly based on the condition `j > k`.***
