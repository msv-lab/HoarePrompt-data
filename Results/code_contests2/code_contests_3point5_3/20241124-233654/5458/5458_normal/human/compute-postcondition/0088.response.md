Postcondition: ***`s`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `j` is greater than 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo `mod`. The values of `s`, `m`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block, covering all possible edge cases.***
