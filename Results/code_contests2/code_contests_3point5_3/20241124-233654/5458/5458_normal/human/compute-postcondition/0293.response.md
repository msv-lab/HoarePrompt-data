Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i, j, k` and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j, m, s, i, and n` remain the same, `k` is within the range [1, s] and `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`j, m, s, i, and n` remain the same, `k` is within the range [1, s] and `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.**
