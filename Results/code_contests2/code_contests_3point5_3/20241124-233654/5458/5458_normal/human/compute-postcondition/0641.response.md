Output State: **After the loop executes, `s` remains greater than or equal to 1, `j` remains less than `m`, and `k` is updated up to `s`. Depending on the conditions inside the loop, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are either assigned specific values, updated based on certain conditions, or remain unchanged. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to specific rules. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then no changes occur to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the loop executes, ensuring the correct state of the variables. In cases where the loop does not execute, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.**
