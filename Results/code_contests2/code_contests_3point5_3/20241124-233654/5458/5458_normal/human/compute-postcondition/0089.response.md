According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `j` is greater than 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo `mod`. Since the loop depends on `k` being less than or equal to `s`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`s`, `m`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j` are integers**
