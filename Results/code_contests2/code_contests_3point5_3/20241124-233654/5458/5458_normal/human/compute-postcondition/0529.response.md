Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `m`, `s` have their initial values, `k` is less than `s`.
Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s` have their initial values, `k` is less than `s`**
