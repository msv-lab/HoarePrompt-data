Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the program continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made, and the program continues.***
