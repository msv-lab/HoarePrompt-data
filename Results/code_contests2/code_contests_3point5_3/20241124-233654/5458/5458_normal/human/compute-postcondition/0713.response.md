Example Answer:
The value at position `i + 1 & 1` in the 3-dimensional array `dp` is assigned the value at position `i + 1 & 1` in the `j`th row and `k`th column of the array. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` are all 1, and `i` is an integer. After the execution, the array `dp` is updated based on the assignment. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` are all 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
