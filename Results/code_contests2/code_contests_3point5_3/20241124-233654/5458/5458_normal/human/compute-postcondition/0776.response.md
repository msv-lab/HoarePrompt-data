Output State: **All variables remain integers greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is assigned 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k + 1]`. If `j` is not greater than `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k + 1]` by `mod` and adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k + 1 - j]` by `mod`.**
