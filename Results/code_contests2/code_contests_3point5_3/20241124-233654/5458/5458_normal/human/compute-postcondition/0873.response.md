Postcondition: ***`s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `k` is 1, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `j` is greater than 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program execution continues.***
