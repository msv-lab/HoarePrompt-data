According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `n` are integers where `i`, `k`, and `n` are the same. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `j` needs to be adjusted to `j + 1`.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `j` needs to be adjusted to `j + 1`.
- If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `j` needs to be adjusted to `j + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `n` are integers where `i`, `k`, and `n` are the same, and `k` is less than or equal to `s`**
