According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is between 1 and s inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, the values of j, m, s, k, i, and n will remain the same. To execute the loop one more time, k needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **The values of j, m, s, k, i, and n remain the same, k is incremented by 1**
