Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are adjusted to the next value in the range 1 to `s + 1`, `i` and `n` retain their initial values. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.**
