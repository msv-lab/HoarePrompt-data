Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is either 0 or 1, dp state remains the same. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to the program state.***
