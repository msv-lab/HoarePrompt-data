Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Since no other variables are mentioned in the code snippet, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`k` is the next value within the range 1 to `s`, `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `mod` remains unchanged**
