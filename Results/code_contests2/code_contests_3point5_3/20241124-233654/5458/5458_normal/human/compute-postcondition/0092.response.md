Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, so the output state is: `s`, `m`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j` are integers, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`s`, `m`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j` are integers, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
