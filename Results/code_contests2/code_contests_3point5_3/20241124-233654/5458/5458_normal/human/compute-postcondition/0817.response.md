Postcondition: ***`s`, `k + 2`, `i`, `j`, `mod`, `m` are integers. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. No changes are made to any other variables. This assignment occurs without any additional conditions or modifications to the other variables.***
