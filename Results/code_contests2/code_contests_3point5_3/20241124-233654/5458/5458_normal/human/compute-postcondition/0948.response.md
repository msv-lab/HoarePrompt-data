Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1**
