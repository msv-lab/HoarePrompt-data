Output State: **`j` is an integer, `m` remains unchanged, `dp` is updated based on loop conditions, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains unchanged, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
