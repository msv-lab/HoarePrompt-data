Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not given, but `k` is initially 2. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is 2, `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `mod` remains unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`k` is 2, `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `mod` remains unchanged, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
