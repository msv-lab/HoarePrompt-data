Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` maintain their initial values and relationships. `n` is greater than 0. The 2D list `dp` is properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`, and `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`. Depending on the value of `i`, if `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. In all cases, the relationships and values of the variables are maintained after the execution of the program fragment.***
