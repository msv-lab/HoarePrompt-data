According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `s`, `j`, and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is 2. 

1. Since the loop is iterating over `k` from 1 to `s`, the next value of `k` needs to be considered, so `k` should be updated to `k + 1`.
2. If `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. As `j` is less than `m`, `j` needs to be incremented, so `j` should be updated to `j + 1`.
3. For the condition where `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, so `k` should remain the same in this case.
4. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. So, `k` should remain the same in this case as well.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is updated to `k + 1**.
