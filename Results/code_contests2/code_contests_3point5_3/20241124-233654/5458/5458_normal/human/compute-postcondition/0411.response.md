Postcondition: ***`j` and `k` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. After the execution, `m` remains unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `i` is not equal to 0, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on certain conditions. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, the value is calculated as the remainder of the division of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] by mod, then added with the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. `m` remains unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` remains unchanged.***
