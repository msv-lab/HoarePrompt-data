According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `m`, and `s` is at least 1. If the conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are met, the loop continues. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to `j + 1` and the conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` need to be checked.
State: **All variables maintain their initial conditions after the loop executes, except `j` is now `j + 1`, `s` is at least 1**
