According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2. `k` being 2 is less than `s`, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, `i` can be any value**
