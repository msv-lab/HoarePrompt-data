According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `s` all need to be adjusted to remain positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ s ≤ 3000, and mod is 100000.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ s ≤ 3000, mod is 100000**
