Example Answer:
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is 0 or 1, dp state remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is 0 or 1, dp state remains the same**
