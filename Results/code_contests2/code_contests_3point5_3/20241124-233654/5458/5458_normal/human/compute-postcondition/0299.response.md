According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range [1, `s`]. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. `k` is within the range [1, `s`]. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Subsequently, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. `k` is within the range [1, `s`]**
