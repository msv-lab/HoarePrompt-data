Output State: **All variables `j`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. `k` is within the range [1, `s` + 1]. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
