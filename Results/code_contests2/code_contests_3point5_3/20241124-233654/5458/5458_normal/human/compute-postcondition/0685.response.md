According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k+1` needs to be less than or equal to `s+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1`, `i` are integers. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k+1` is less than or equal to `s+1`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and the dp state remains the same**
