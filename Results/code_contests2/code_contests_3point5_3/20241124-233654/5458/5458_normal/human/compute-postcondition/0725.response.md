Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, `j`, and `k` respectively. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
