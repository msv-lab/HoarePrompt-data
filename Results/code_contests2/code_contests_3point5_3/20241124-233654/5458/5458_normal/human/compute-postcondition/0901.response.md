Output State: **`s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are all 1. `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `mod`, and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `j + 1` is greater than 1 and `j + 1` is greater than `k`. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
