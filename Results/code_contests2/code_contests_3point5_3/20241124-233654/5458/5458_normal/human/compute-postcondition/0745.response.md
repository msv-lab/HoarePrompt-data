Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly stated, so the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
