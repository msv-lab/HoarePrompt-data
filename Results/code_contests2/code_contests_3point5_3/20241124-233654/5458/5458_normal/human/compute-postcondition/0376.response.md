Output State: **`j`, `m`, `dp`, `k`, `s`, `i` are integers. If `j` is greater than `m`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code, `k` is greater than `s`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
