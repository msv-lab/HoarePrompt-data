Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is updated to `k + 1`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on specific conditions: if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if-else block, ensuring the correct state of the program variables.***
