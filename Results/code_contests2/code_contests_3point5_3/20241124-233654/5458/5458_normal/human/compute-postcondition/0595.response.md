Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `n` are integers satisfying `j` < `m`, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1, `k` is less than `s`, `i` is 0 if the if part is executed, otherwise `i` is a non-zero integer. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` mod `mod`, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
