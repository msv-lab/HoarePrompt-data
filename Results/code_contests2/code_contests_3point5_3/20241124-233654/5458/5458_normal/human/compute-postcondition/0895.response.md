According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, where `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop is iterating over `k` from 1 to `s`, the next iteration should have `k` incremented by 1.

State: **`s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 3`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, where `k + 2` is less than or equal to `s`**
