At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were met:
- `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `s` is greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is less than or equal to `s`

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time according to the specified conditions:
- If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, set `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1.
- If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is strictly greater than `k`, update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, assign `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- Increment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

Adjust the values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` accordingly for the next iteration based on the specified conditions.

State: **Adjust `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` according to the specified conditions for the next iteration**.
