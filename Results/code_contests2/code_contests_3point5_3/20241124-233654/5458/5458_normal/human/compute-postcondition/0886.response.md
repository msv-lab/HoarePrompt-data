According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, where `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Based on the conditions in the code, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and remain less than or equal to `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, where `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`**
