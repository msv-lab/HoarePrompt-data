Postcondition: ***`j + 1`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1. `k` and `i` maintain their initial values and relationships as described. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and continues without any changes to the state.***
