According to the loop code provided, the loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is greater than `m`, `dp` is updated based on certain conditions, `k` is greater than `s`, and `i` is equal to 0. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k + 1`.
State: **`j`, `m`, `dp`, `k + 1`, `s`, `i` are integers**
