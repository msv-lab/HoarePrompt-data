Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The variables `i`, `j`, `k` are updated to the next value. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` is updated to the next value, `i` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` is updated to the next value, `i` is less than `n`**
