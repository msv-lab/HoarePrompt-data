Output State: **k, n, m are integers greater than or equal to 1, s is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 3000, mod is 100000, i is a non-zero integer. If j is greater than k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.**
