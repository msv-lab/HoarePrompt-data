Postcondition: ***`s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `j` is greater than 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program execution continues. Subsequently, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, with the final value being the sum of the previous `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
