Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly given, but based on the nature of the assignment, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is copied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
