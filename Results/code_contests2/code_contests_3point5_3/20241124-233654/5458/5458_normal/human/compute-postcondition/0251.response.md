According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` remains 1, `m` remains at least 1, `s` remains greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated based on the loop range, `i` stays less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated accordingly. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` should be less than or equal to `m`
- `j` should be incremented by 1, so `j` needs to be adjusted to `j + 1`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`j` is 2, `m` remains at least 1, `s` remains greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated based on the loop range, `i` stays less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated accordingly**
