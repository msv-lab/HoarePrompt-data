According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, the loop will iterate from 1 to `s + 1`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is less than `m`. 

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 1**
