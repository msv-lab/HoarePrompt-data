According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` have their initial values. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be updated to the next value in the range `1` to `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k + 1` have their initial values**
