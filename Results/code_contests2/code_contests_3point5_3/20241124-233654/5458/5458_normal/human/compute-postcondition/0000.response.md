Example Answer: 
`mod` is assigned the value 100000. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is `n, m, s are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ s ≤ 3000; mod is 100000.
Output State: **`n, m, s are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ s ≤ 3000; mod is 100000**
