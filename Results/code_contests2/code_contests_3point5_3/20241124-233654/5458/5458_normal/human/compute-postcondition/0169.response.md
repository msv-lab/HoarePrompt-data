According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. After the execution of the if-else block, the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` needs to be updated based on the conditions provided. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j + 1`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. `i` and `j` maintain their initial values and relationships as described. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state of `k` needs to be adjusted to `k + 1` to satisfy the loop condition. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`j + 1`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1. `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` and `j` maintain their initial values and relationships as described**
