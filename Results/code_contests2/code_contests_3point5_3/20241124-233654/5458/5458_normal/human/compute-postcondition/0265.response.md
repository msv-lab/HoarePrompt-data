According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is an integer with a minimum value of 2, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to 1, `i` is less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1 as it is currently at the end value of `s`.
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` needs to be updated according to the conditions mentioned in the code.
- No other states need adjustment for the next iteration.
State: **`j` is an integer with a minimum value of 2, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to the next value, `i` is less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated.**
