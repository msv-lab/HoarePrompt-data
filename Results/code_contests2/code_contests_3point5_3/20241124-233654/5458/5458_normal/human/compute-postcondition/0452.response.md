Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are all 1, so the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `n` are all equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `n` are all equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
