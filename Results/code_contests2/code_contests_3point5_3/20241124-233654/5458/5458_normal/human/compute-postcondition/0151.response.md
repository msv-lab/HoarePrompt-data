Postcondition: ***`j + 1`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1. `k` and `i` maintain their initial values and relationships as described. `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the dynamic programming array `dp` at index `i + 1` of the second dimension, `j + 1` of the third dimension, and `k` of the fourth dimension is assigned the value 1.***
