Postcondition: ***All variables maintain their initial conditions after the loop executes, except `j` which is now less than `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues.***
