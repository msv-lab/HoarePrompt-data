Output State: **`s` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. After running the code snippet, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo `mod`.**
