Postcondition: ***`s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, where `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Overall, the program state remains consistent with the initial conditions after the execution of the if statement, ensuring the integrity of the variable values within the specified ranges.***
