Postcondition: ***All variables `s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` remain integers greater than or equal to 1. `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after the execution of the code snippet. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.***
