According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, and `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on previous values. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range `1` to `s + 1`, and other states remain unchanged.
State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` is adjusted to the next value in the range `1` to `s + 1`, `i` and `n` have their initial values**.
