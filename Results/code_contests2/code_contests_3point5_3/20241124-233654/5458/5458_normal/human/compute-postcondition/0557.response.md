Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than `s`, `i` and `n` are integers where `i`, `k`, and `n` are the same.
Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than `s`, `i` and `n` are integers where `i`, `k`, and `n` are the same**
