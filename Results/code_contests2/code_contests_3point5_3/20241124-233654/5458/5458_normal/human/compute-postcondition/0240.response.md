According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `i` is less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since `k` is the loop variable, it needs to be adjusted. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` is less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated**
