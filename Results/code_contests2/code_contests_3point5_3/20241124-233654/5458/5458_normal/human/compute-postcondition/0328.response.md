Output State: **All variables `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `i` maintain their initial values and relationships. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned based on the input received from `raw_input().split()`. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution without any changes to the variables `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `i`. The 2D list `dp` is initialized with dimensions based on the values of `m` and `s`.**
