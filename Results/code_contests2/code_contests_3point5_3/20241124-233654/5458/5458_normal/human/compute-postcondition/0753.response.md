According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **After the execution of the if-else block, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 2**
