Example Answer: 
If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. No changes are made to other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` maintain their initial values and relationships; `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` maintain their initial values and relationships; `n` is greater than 0**
