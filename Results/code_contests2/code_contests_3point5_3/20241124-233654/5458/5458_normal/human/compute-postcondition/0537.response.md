Based on the given conditions and the for loop statement provided, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Therefore, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than `j`.
2. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. In this case, no adjustments are needed as the values of `j`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged.
3. If `n` is less than 1 or the loop does not start due to specific conditions, the values of the variables will remain at their initial values. 

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `k` is less than `j`**
