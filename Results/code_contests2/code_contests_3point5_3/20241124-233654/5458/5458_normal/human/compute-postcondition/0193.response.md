Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` and `j` maintain their initial values and relationships. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
