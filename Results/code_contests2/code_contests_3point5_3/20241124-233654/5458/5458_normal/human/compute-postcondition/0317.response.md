According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range [1, `s` + 1]. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `j`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. `k` is within the range [1, `s` + 1]. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since the loop is iterating over `k`, the next iteration would require incrementing `k` by 1.
2. Since all other variables remain unchanged, there is no need to adjust them.

State: **All variables `j`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. `k` is within the range [1, `s` + 1], incremented by 1.**
