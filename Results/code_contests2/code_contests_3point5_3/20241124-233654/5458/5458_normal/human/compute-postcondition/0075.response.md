According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `s` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once, no other specific states are mentioned. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` needs to be greater than 1.
State: **If `s` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. `m` is greater than 1**
