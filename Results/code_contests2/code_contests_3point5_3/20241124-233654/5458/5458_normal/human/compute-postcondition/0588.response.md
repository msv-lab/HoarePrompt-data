Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s`, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, `k` should be adjusted to a value less than `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j`, `m`, `s` are integers with values satisfying `j` < `m`, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. `k` is an integer with value less than `s`, `i` is an integer with value 0 if the if part is executed, otherwise `i` is an integer with value different than 0. `n` remains unchanged.**
