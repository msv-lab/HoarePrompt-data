Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the variables are not explicitly mentioned, so we can assume that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` already has a certain value. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, where `k` is less than or equal to `s`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, where `k` is less than or equal to `s`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**.
