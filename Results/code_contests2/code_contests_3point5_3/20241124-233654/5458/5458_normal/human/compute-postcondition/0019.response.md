Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. The previous values of the variables are as follows: k, n, m are integers greater than or equal to 1, s is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 3000, mod is 100000, i is a non-zero integer. Therefore, the Output State is: k, n, m are integers greater than or equal to 1, s is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 3000, mod is 100000, i is a non-zero integer.
Output State: **k, n, m are integers greater than or equal to 1, s is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 3000, mod is 100000, i is a non-zero integer**
