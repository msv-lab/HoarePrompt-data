According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m`, `s`, and `n`. If both `m` and `s` are greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if the loop executed, the values of `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `n` remain the same. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the values of `m` and `s` need to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j`, `k`, `i`, and `n` remain the same**
