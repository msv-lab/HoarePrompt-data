Example Answer:
If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. After that, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.
Output State: **dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the conditions provided**
