Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` have their initial values. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and the program continues to the next iteration. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, the values of `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are retained after the execution of the if else block.***
