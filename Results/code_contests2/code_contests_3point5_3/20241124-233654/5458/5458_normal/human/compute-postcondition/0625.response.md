Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 2.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 2**
