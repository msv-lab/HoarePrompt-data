Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s` are integers with values satisfying `j` < `m`, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. `k` is an integer with value 1, `i` is an integer with value 0, `n` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The variables maintain their initial conditions with the addition of the assignment to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` when `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
