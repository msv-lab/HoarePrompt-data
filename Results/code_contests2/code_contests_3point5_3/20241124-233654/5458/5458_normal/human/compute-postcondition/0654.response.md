According to the code, the loop can execute as long as s is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer, and `j` is 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to set `k` to 1, `s` to at least 1, and ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, and `j` is 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
