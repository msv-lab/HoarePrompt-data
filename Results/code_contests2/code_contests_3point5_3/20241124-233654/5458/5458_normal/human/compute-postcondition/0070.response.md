Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The initial state indicates that `k` is the next value within the range 1 to `s`, and other variables have specific constraints. The execution continues based on the postcondition provided in the initial state.
Output State: **Variables `k`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `mod` remain unchanged.**
