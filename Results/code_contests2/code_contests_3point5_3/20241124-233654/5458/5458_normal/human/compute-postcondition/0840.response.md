According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `m`. So, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should still be less than `m`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All variables maintain their initial conditions after the loop executes, except `j` which is now less than `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than `m`**
