Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `m`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i`, `n` are integers satisfying `j` < `m`, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. `k + 1` is an integer less than `s`.
Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i`, `n` are integers satisfying `j` < `m`, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. `k + 1` is an integer less than `s`**
