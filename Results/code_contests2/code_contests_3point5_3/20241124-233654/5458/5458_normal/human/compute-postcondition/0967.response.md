According to the code, the loop will execute if `j` is greater than `k` and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed at least once (`i` is not mentioned), and `j` is greater than `k`. So to execute the loop one more time, `j` should still be greater than `k` and `s` should be greater than or equal to 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, where `j` is greater than `k**.
