Postcondition: ***k is 2, n, m, s are greater than or equal to 1, mod remains unchanged. If j is greater than k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The overall state after the if statement execution ensures the consistency of the initial conditions with the assigned values of the variables and the provided logic.***
