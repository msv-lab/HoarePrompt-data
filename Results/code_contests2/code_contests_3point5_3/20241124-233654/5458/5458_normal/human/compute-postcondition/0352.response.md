Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` maintain their initial values and relationships; `n` is greater than 0. The 2D list `dp` is properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
