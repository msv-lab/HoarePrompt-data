According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `m` and `s` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `m`, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. This means that the loop can execute one more time. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
1. `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` needs to be adjusted based on the conditions mentioned in the loop description.

State: **All variables maintain their initial conditions except `j` which is less than `m`, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 3.**
