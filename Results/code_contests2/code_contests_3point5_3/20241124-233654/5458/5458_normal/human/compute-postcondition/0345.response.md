Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` maintain their initial values and relationships. `n` is greater than 0. The 2D list `dp` is properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s`. The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.**
