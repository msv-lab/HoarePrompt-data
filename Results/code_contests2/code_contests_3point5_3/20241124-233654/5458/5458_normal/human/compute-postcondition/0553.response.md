Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `n` are integers where `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k`, `i`, and `n` are the same. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k`, `i`, and `n` remain the same, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then added to the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
