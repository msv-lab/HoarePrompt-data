Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `i` can be any value. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues without any changes. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.***
