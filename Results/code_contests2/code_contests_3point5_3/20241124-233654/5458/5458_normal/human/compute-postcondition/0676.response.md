According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is either 0 or 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
- No other states need adjustment based on the provided information.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1`, `i` are integers. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is either 0 or 1, dp state remains the same**
