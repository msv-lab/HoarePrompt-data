Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, so the exact indices cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` are adjusted according to the specified conditions for the next iteration.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` are adjusted according to the specified conditions for the next iteration**
