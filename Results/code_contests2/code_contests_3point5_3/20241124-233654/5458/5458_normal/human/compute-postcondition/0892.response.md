Output State: **`s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, where `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and the program continues. All other variables remain unchanged.**
