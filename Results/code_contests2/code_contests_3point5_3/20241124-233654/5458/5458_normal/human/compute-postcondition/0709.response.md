Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` are all 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
