Postcondition: ***`s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `m` are all integers greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod` and adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`. All variables maintain their initial relationships and values ensuring `s`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `m` remain greater than or equal to 1 and `i` retains the value of 0.***
