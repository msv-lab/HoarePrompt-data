Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is also known. Therefore, after execution, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, where `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`**
