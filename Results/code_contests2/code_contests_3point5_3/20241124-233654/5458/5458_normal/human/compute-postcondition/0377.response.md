Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `dp`, `k`, `s`, `i` are integers. If `j` is greater than `m`, `dp` is updated based on the loop code conditions, `k` is greater than `s`, and `i` is equal to 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 when `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than `m`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code, `k` is greater than `s`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, in this case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified by taking the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
