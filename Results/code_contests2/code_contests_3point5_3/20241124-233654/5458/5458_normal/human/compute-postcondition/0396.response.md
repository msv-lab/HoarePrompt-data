According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `m`, `dp`, `k + 2`, `s`, `i` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 or `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, there are no changes to the variables. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` must be less than `s + 1`.
State: **`j`, `m`, `dp`, `k + 2`, `s`, `i` are integers, `k` is less than `s + 1**
