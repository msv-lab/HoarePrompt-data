Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Since `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the modulo operation applied to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The initial conditions remain consistent with the assigned values and provided logic.
Output State: **k is 2, n, m, s are greater than or equal to 1, mod remains unchanged, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the modulo operation**
