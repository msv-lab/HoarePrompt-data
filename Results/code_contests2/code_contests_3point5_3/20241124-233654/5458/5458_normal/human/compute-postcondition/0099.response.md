Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of the variables are unknown, but based on the conditions provided, `s`, `m`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j + 1` are integers meeting the conditions for the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `m`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j + 1` are integers meeting the conditions for the next iteration, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`s`, `m`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j + 1` are integers meeting the conditions for the next iteration, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
