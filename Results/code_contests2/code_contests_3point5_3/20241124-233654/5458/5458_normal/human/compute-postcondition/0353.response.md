According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s` based on its current value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` maintain their initial values and relationships; `n` is greater than 0. The 2D list `dp` is properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s + 1`**
