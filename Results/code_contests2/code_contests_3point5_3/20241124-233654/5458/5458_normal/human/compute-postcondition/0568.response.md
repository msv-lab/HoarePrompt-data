Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than `s + 1`, `i` and `n` are integers where `i`, `k`, and `n` are the same, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the condition. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues. All other variables maintain their initial conditions as described in the precondition.***
