Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `i`, `j`, and `k` are variables. The state of variables `i`, `j`, and `k` remains unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`**
