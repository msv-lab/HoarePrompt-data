Output State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` are adjusted according to the specified conditions for the next iteration. If `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], while all other variables remain unchanged. In all other cases where j is less than or equal to k, no changes are made to any variable.**
