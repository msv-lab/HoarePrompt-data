Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1`, `i` are integers. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and the dp state remains the same. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j > k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, if `i` is 1 and `j <= k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
