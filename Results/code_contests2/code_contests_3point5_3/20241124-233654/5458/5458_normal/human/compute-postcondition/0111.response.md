According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be set to 1.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should take the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

State: **Adjust the states based on the conditions mentioned above.**
