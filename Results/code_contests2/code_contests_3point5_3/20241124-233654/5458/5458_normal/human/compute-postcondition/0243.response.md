Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so the output state is: `j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` is less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated.
Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` is less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated**
