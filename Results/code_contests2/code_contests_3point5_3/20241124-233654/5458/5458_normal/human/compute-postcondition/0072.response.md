Postcondition: ***`k`, `s`, `n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `mod` remains unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo `mod` plus dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo `mod`.***
