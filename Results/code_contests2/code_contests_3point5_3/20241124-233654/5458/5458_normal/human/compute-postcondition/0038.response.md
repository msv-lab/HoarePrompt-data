Postcondition: ***`k` is incremented by 1, all other states remain the same. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, no change occurs. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. If none of these conditions are met, the variables retain their initial states.***
