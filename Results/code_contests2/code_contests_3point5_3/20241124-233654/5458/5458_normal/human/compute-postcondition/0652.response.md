According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. The loop will iterate `n` squared times. Before the loop starts, to ensure the loop will execute, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 1, `m` can be any integer value, and `s` can also be any integer value. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer, `s` is an integer**
