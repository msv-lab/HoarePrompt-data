Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1`, `i` are integers. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is either 0 or 1, dp state remains the same. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, there is no change in the dp state and all other variables remain unchanged.***
