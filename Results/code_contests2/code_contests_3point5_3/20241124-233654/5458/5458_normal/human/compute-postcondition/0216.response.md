According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` ranges from 0 to `n ** 2 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has reached `n ** 2 - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `n ** 2 - 1`.

State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `i` maintain their initial values and relationships, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on loop conditions. `i` is less than `n ** 2 - 1.**
