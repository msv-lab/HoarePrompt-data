At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions were met: `m` remains unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`j`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. After the execution, `m` remains unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `i` is not equal to 0, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on certain conditions - if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, the value is calculated as the remainder of the division of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] by mod, then added with the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. `m` remains unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` remains unchanged. `k` should be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`j`, `k + 1`, `m`, `s`, `i` are integers**.
