Postcondition: ***`j + 1`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1. `k` is less than or equal to `s`. The initial values and relationships of `i` and `j` are maintained throughout. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
