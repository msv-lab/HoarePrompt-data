According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are: 
State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` maintain their initial values and relationships, `n` is greater than 0, 2D list `dp` is properly initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`**
