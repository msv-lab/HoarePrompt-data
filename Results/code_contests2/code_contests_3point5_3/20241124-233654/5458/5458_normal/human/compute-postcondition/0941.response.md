Postcondition: ***`s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `m` are integers with `s` greater than or equal to 1, `i` equal to 1, `j + 1 <= k`, `k` equal to 1, `mod` and `m` greater than or equal to 1, and `i` not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after the execution of the code.***
