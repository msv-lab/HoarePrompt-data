According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are all integers less than `s + 1`, `i` and `n` are both equal to 1, and `s` is greater than 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since the loop iterates over `k` and the condition is `k` is less than or equal to `s`, we need to increment `k` by 1.
2. All other states remain the same as they satisfy the loop condition.
State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are all integers less than `s + 1`, `i` and `n` are both equal to 1, and `s` is greater than 0, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**
