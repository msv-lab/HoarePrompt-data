Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is 0 or 1, dp state remains the same. If j > k, the value of dp at the updated indices is equal to the value of dp at the previous indices, and the loop continues without any changes.***
