According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than `s`, `i` and `n` are integers where `i`, `k`, and `n` are the same. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` needs to be initialized according to the conditions mentioned in the code snippet.

State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than `s + 1`, `i` and `n` are integers where `i`, `k`, and `n` are the same, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly**.
