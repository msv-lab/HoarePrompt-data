According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are adjusted to the next value in the range 1 to `s + 1`, `i` and `n` retain their initial values. 

To execute the loop one more time:
- `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range 1 to `s + 1`
- `m` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range 1 to `s + 1`
- `s` remains the same
- `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range 1 to `s + 1`
- `i` remains the same
- `n` remains the same

State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are adjusted to the next value in the range 1 to `s + 1`, `i` and `n` retain their initial values**
