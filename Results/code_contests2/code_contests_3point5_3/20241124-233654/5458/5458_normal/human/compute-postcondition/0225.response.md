Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is less than `n`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated, i is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is less than `n`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated, i is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
