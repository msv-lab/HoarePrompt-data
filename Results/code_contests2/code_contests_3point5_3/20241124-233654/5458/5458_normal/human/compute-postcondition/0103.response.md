Postcondition: ***`s`, `m`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j + 1` are integers meeting the conditions for the next iteration. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. The variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships for the next iteration, ensuring the integrity of the program state.***
