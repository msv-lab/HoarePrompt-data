Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `n` have their initial values. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` becomes equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. In this case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. Moreover, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The loop will not execute if `s` is less than or equal to 0.**
