Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `n` are integers where `i`, `k`, and `n` are the same. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
