Output State: **`j`, `k`, `m`, `s` are integers, `i` is 0. The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1 if i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k. If i is not 0, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the conditions provided. `m` remains unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is incremented by 1 for the next loop execution.**
