Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The state of `i`, `j`, and `k` is not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` needs to be adjusted based on conditions related to `i`, `j`, and `k` for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` needs to be adjusted based on conditions related to `i`, `j`, and `k` for the loop to execute one more time**
