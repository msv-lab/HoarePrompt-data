Example Answer: 
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `m` are not specified, so the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 2, and the new value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
