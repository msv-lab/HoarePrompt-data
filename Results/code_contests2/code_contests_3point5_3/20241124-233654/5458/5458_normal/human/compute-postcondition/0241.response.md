Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` is less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated to 1.
Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` is less than `n`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` is updated to 1**
