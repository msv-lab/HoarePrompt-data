According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k ranges from 1 to s inclusive. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are k is 1, s is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, n and m are greater than or equal to 1, and mod is 100000.
State: **k is 1, n and m are greater than or equal to 1, s is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, mod is 100000**
