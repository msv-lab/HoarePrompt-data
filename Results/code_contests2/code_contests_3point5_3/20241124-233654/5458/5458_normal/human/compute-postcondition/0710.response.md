According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` are all 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is 2. Since `k` is 2 at the end of the previous iteration and the loop can execute for `k` up to `s`, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `k`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` are all 1, `i` is an integer, `k` is 3**
