Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `n` are integers satisfying `j` < `m`, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. `k` is an integer less than `s`. `i` is an integer that is 0 if the if part is executed, otherwise `i` is a non-zero integer. After the execution of the if else block, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is determined based on the conditions. If `i` is 0 and `j` >= `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` > `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` mod `mod`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the sum of the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` mod `mod` and the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k]` mod `mod`.***
