According to the code, the loop will execute if `j` is greater than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is greater than 1, and `j` is greater than `k`. Therefore, the loop will execute again. The states need to be adjusted as follows:
- Update `j` to `j + 1`.
- Update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` according to the conditions provided:
    - If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, set `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1.
    - If `i != 0` and `j > k`, update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
    - Otherwise, update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

State: **`s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k`, `mod`, and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, where `j + 1` is greater than 1, and `j + 1` is greater than `k`.**
