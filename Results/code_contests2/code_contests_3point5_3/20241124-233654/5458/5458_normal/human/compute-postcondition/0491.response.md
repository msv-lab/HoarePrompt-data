Postcondition: ***`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are adjusted to the next value in the range 1 to s + 1, `i` and `n` retain their initial values. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. In this case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is then calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if else block.***
