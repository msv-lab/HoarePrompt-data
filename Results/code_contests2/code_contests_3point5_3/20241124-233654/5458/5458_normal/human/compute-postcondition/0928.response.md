Postcondition: ***`s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues without any change in state. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
