Output State: **`j`, `m`, `s`, `k` maintain their initial values and relationships. `n` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and the loop continues. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dp` and the loop proceeds.**
