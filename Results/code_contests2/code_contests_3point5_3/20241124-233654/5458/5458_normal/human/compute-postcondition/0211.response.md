Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` are adjusted according to the specified conditions for the next iteration. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the execution continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. All other variables retain their previous values.***
