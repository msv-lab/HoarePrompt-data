Postcondition: ***`j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` and `j` maintain their initial values and relationships, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].***
