Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `dp` state remains the same. The value of `dp` at the updated indices is equal to the value of `dp` at the previous indices.**
