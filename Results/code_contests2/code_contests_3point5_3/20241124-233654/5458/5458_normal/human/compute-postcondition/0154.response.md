Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i` is not affected and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `j + 1`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1. `k` and `i` maintain their initial values and relationships as described. i is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`j + 1`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1. `k` and `i` maintain their initial values and relationships as described. i is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`**
