Postcondition: ***`s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` does not equal 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, in the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
