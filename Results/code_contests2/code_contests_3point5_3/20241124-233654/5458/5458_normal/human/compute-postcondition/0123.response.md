Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
