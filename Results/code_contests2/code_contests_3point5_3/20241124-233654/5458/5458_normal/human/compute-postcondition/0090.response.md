Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of the variables are `s`, `m`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j` as integers. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `m`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j` are integers, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`s`, `m`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
