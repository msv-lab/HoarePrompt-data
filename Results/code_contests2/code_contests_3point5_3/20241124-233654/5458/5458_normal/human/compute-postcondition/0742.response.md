Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted according to the conditions involving `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. All edge cases for the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are considered to maintain the loop's functionality.**
