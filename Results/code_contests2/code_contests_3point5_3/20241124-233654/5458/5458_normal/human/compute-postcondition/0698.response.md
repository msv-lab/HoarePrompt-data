Output State: **n, m, s, j+1, k are 1. i is an integer not equal to 0. If j is greater than k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the program continues without any change in state. If j is less than or equal to k, no changes are made to the state of the program variables.**
