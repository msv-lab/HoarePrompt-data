According to the code, the loop can execute depending on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is less than `m` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is at least 1 and `k` is 1.
State: **`j` is less than `m`, `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i`, and `n` remain the same**
