Postcondition: ***k, n, m are integers greater than or equal to 1. s is a positive integer between 1 and 3000. mod is 100000. If i is equal to 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is non-zero and j is greater than k, dp[1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[1][j][k]. Otherwise, dp[1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[1][j][k] modulo mod and then increased by dp[0][j][k - j] modulo mod.***
