Postcondition: ***`s`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `m` are all integers greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. All variables retain their original values and relationships, ensuring `s`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `m` remain greater than or equal to 1 and `i` remains 0.***
