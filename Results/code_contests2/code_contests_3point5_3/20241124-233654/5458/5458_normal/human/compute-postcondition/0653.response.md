According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1. Additionally, `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `m`, so the loop will execute `m` times. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer, and `j` is 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer, `j` is 1**
