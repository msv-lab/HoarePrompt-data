Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input values for `n`, `m`, and `s` until all three are 0 as described in the problem description.
- It then uses dynamic programming to update a 3D array `dp` to calculate the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given conditions.
- The final computed value is printed, which represents the remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created divided by 100000.
- The code seems to follow the problem description accurately and there are no edge cases identified that are not handled by the code.
- The output hints also align with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
