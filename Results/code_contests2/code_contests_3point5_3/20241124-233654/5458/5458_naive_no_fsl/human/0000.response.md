Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created given the constraints mentioned in the problem description. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible Bingo cards based on the input values of N, M, and S. It considers all possible scenarios and ensures that the conditions for creating a Bingo card are met.

The program iterates over different values of integers written in the squares and sums of integers to determine the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created. It correctly handles the edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.

Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output for all possible input scenarios.
