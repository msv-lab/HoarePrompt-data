Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given conditions. It uses dynamic programming to iterate over all possible combinations of integers in the Bingo card squares and calculates the number of valid Bingo cards. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output for each dataset. Additionally, the program terminates when the input values of N, M, and S are all zero as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the given problem.
