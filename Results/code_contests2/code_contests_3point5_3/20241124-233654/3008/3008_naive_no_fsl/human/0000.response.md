Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to reduce the magic number to zero as described in the problem. The program does not handle the case where the digit to be subtracted is not the last digit of the magic number. For example, if the input is 24, the correct output should be 5 (24 -> 20 -> 18 -> 10 -> 9 -> 0), but the program will output 4. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
