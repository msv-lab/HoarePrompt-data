Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is missing the necessary conversion of the input `n` to an integer type for mathematical operations. Additionally, there is no condition or error handling for cases where the input `n` is negative or non-integer. The code also does not implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of operations needed to reduce the magic number to zero as described in the problem statement. 

The output hints also mention that the code is missing a conversion of the input `n` to an integer type and that there is a missing condition or error handling for negative or non-integer inputs. Therefore, based on the discrepancy between the code and the problem description, as well as the hints provided, the correctness of the code is **False**.
