Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the value of `n` will be a non-negative integer after the input operation. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is a non-negative integer**.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer**
