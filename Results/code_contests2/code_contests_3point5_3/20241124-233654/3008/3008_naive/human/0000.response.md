Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. 

For example, if the input is 24, the expected output should be 5 according to the problem description. However, the program will output an error because it tries to perform arithmetic operations on the input as a string without converting it to an integer first. 

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases and is considered incorrect.
