The function prompts the user for an input, calculates a value based on the input, and prints the result. If the remainder of the input divided by 10 is not 0, it sets a variable `s` to 1; otherwise, `s` remains 0. It then calculates `2 * (n / 10) + s` and prints the result. However, the code lacks error handling for non-integer inputs or division by zero scenarios.
