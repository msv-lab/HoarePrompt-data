Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described in the problem statement. The code simply calculates the minimum number of subtractions based on the input number, but it does not follow the rules mentioned in the problem description. The code needs to actually perform the subtraction operation on the input number until it reaches zero by subtracting a digit that occurs in the number.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.
