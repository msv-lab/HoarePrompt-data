You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Yet another Armageddon is coming! This time the culprit is the Julya tribe calendar. 

The beavers in this tribe knew math very well. Smart Beaver, an archaeologist, got a sacred plate with a magic integer on it. The translation from Old Beaverish is as follows: 

"May the Great Beaver bless you! May your chacres open and may your third eye never turn blind from beholding the Truth! Take the magic number, subtract a digit from it (the digit must occur in the number) and get a new magic number. Repeat this operation until a magic number equals zero. The Earth will stand on Three Beavers for the time, equal to the number of subtractions you perform!"

Distinct subtraction sequences can obviously get you different number of operations. But the Smart Beaver is ready to face the worst and is asking you to count the minimum number of operations he needs to reduce the magic number to zero.

Input

The single line contains the magic integer n, 0 ≤ n.

  * to get 20 points, you need to solve the problem with constraints: n ≤ 106 (subproblem C1); 
  * to get 40 points, you need to solve the problem with constraints: n ≤ 1012 (subproblems C1+C2); 
  * to get 100 points, you need to solve the problem with constraints: n ≤ 1018 (subproblems C1+C2+C3). 

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum number of subtractions that turns the magic number to a zero.

Examples

Input

24


Output

5

Note

In the first test sample the minimum number of operations can be reached by the following sequence of subtractions: 

24 → 20 → 18 → 10 → 9 → 0
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    s = 0
    if (n % 10 != 0) :
        s = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is 0 or 1, depending on the condition `n % 10 != 0`. If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is not equal to 0, then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.
    print(2 * (n / 10) + s)

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
