Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The previous value of `temp` is 0, and `arr1[j]` holds the j-th element of `arr1`. Therefore, `temp` will now hold the maximum value between its previous value and the j-th element of `arr1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` holds the updated maximum value, `arr` contains 0, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2**
