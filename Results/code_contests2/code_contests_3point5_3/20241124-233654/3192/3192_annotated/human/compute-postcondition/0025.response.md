According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` holds the updated maximum value, `arr` contains 0, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, and `j` is less than or equal to `arr1[0]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `arr1[0]` + 1 as the loop will execute until `j` reaches `arr1[0]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` holds the updated maximum value, `arr` contains 0, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is less than or equal to `arr1[0]` + 1**
