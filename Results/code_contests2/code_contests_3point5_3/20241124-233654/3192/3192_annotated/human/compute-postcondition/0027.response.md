According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` holds the updated maximum value, `arr` contains 0, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is less than or equal to `arr1[0]` + 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted. Since `j` is currently less than or equal to `arr1[0]` + 1, it should be updated to `j` is less than `arr1[0]` + 1.

State: **`arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` holds the updated maximum value, `arr` contains 0, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is less than `arr1[0]` + 1**
