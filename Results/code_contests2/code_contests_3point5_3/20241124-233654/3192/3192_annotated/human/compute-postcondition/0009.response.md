According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and the element at index `j` in `arr1`, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2**
