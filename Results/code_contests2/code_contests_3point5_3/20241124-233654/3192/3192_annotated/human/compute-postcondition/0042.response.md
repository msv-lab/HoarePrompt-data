Output State: **The loop finds the maximum value in arr1 and updates temp with that value. The loop will execute at least once if arr1 has more than one element. If arr1 only has one element, the loop does not execute and temp remains the maximum value of the first element of arr1. After the loop, arr2 still contains the first element of arr1, temp holds the maximum value from arr1, arr contains the appended temp value, maxval holds the updated maximum value, i is 2, n is equal to or greater than 2, j is less than or equal to arr1[0], and maxval is updated with the maximum value between arr[i] and the current maxval.**
