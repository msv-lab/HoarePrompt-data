Example Answer: 
The code appends the first element of `arr1` to `arr2`. The maximum value in `arr1` is stored in `temp`, and after the loop, `temp` will contain the maximum value in `arr1`. Therefore, the output state is: `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains `temp`.
Output State: **`arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains `temp`**
