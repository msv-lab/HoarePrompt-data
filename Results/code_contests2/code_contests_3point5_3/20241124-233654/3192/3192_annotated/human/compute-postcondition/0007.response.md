According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, `temp` is 0, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1**
