According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented, so it should be adjusted to `i` is 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` contains the maximum value from each input list `arr1`, `arr2` contains the number of elements in each `arr1`, `maxval` holds the maximum value from all `arr` elements, `ans` is updated based on the calculation: ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i], `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `ans` is updated based on the calculation: ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]**
