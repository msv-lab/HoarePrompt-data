Example Answer:
The `maxval` variable is updated to hold the maximum value between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`. The previous value of `maxval` is unknown, but it is initialized as the maximum value in `arr1`, which is stored in the variable `temp`. Therefore, `maxval` will now hold the maximum value between the previous `maxval` and the current element at index `i` in `arr1`. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains `temp`, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value**
