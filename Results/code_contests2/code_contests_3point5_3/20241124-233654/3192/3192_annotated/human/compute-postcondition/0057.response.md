Output State: **If n is greater than 0, then after the loop executes, `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval` will retain their initial values, and `ans` will be updated based on the calculation ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i] for each element in the range of n. If n is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute and `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, and `ans` will remain 0.**
