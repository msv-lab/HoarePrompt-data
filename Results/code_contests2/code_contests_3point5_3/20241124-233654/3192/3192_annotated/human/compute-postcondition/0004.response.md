According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `maxval` is 0 does not affect the loop execution. To ensure the loop can execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
