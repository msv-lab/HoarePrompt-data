According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is initialized to 0, `arr` contains `temp`, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is adjusted to ensure `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is 0, `arr` contains 0, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value, `i` is 1, `n` is adjusted to be at least 2.
State: **`arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is 0, `arr` contains 0, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2**
