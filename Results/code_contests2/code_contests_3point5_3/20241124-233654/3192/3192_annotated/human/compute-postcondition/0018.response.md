According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains `temp`, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` is still less than `n`.
State: **`arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains `temp`, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is adjusted to ensure `i` is less than `n`**
