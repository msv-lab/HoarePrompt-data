According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than or equal to `arr1[0]`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than `arr1[0]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` holds the maximum value from `arr1`, `arr` contains the appended `temp` value, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value, `i` is 2, `n` is equal to or greater than 2, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, `arr2` still contains the first element of `arr1`, and `maxval` is updated with the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval**`.
