Output State: **The loop finds the maximum value in arr1 and updates the temp variable with this maximum value. If arr1 is empty or arr1[0] is less than 1, the loop does not execute. After the loop, arr2 contains the first element of arr1, temp holds the maximum value from arr1, arr contains 0, maxval holds the updated maximum value, i is 1, n is adjusted to ensure i is less than n, and j is less than or equal to arr1[0] + 1.**
