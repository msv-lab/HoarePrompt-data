Example Answer:
`maxval` is assigned the value 0. The other variables `n` is an input integer and `arr` is an empty list are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0**
