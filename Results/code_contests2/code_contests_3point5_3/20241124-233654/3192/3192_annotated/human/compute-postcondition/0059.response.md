Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` lists of integers. For each list, it calculates the maximum value excluding the first element and stores it in `arr`. It also keeps track of the number of elements in each list in `arr2` and the overall maximum value in `maxval`. After processing all lists, it calculates a value `ans` based on the difference between the maximum value in `arr` and `maxval`, multiplied by the corresponding number of elements in `arr2`. Finally, it prints the sum `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. If `n` is 0 or negative, no calculations are performed, and the print statement outputs 0.
