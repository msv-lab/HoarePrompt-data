Example Answer:
`temp` is appended to the list `arr`. `temp` contains the maximum value in `arr1` after the loop execution. If the loop executes, `temp` will be updated to the maximum value in `arr1`, otherwise, `temp` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop calculates the maximum value in the list `arr1` and stores it in `temp`. After the loop, `temp` will contain the maximum value in `arr1`, and `temp` is appended to the list `arr`.
Output State: **The loop calculates the maximum value in the list `arr1` and stores it in `temp`. After the loop, `temp` will contain the maximum value in `arr1`, and `temp` is appended to the list `arr`**
