According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value at index 0 in `arr1`. If this value is greater than 1, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the value at index 0 in `arr1` must be greater than or equal to 3 and `j` should be 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and the element at index `j` in `arr1`, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between the current `temp` and the element at index `j` in `arr1**.
