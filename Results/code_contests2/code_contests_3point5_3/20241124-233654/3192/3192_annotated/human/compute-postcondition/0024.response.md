Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` depends on the comparison. The remaining variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` holds the updated maximum value, `arr` contains 0, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is less than or equal to `arr1[0]`.
Output State: **`arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` holds the updated maximum value, `arr` contains 0, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is less than or equal to `arr1[0]`**
