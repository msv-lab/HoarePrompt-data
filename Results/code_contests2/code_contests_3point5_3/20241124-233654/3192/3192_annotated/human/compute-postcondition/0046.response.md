According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is equal to or greater than 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` holds the maximum value from `arr1`, `arr` contains the appended `temp` value, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, `i` is 3, `n` is equal to or greater than 2, `j` is less than or equal to `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated with the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, and `arr2` now has the first element of `arr1` appended to it**
