According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, which implies the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` holds the maximum value from `arr1`, `arr` contains the appended `temp` value, `maxval` holds the updated maximum value, `i` is 2, `n` is equal to or greater than 2, `j` is less than `arr1[0] + 1`, `arr2` still contains the first element of `arr1`, and `maxval` is updated with the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval**.
