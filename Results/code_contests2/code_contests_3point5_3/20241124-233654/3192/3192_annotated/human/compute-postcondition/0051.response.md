According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. This means the loop can execute again. The only state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`arr` contains the maximum value from each input list `arr1`, `arr2` contains the number of elements in each `arr1`, `maxval` holds the maximum value from all `arr` elements, `ans` is updated based on the calculation: ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i], `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
