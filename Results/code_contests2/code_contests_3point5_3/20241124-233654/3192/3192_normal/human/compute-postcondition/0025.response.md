According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, `arr1[0]` is a positive integer greater than 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than `arr1[0]`. So the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` needs to be less than `arr1[0] + 1`.
State: **`temp` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`, `arr` remains the same, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `arr1[0] + 1`, `arr1[0]` is a positive integer greater than 1**
