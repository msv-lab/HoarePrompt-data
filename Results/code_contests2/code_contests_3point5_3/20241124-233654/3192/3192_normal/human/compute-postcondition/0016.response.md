Example Answer:
`arr2` appends the first element of `arr1` to itself. Since no elements are appended to `arr`, `arr2` will only have the first element of `arr1` after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` remains the same, no elements are appended to `arr`; `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`.
Output State: **`temp` remains the same, no elements are appended to `arr`; `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`**
