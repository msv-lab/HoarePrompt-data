According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Given that `arr` is an empty list and `maxval` is 0, we need to adjust the state for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `arr` remains an empty list, `maxval` is 0, and `i` is 0.
State: **`arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
