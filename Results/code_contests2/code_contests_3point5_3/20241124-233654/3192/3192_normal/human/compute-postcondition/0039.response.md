According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`temp` is updated to be the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and `arr1[2]`, `arr` contains the updated `temp`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 3, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2**
