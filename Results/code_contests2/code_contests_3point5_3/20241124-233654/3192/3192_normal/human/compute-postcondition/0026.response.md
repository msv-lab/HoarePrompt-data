Example Answer:
`temp` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The previous value of `temp` is unknown, and `arr1[j]` is not provided, so the new value of `temp` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`, `arr` remains the same, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `arr1[0] + 1`, `arr1[0]` is a positive integer greater than 1.
Output State: **`temp` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`, `arr` remains the same, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `arr1[0] + 1`, `arr1[0]` is a positive integer greater than 1**
