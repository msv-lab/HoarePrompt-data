According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `temp` is 0, `arr` contains the updated `temp`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `arr1[0] + 1, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval` does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted to `temp` is 0, `arr` contains the updated `temp`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval, and `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`temp` is 0, `arr` contains the updated `temp`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2**
