Output State: **`temp` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`, `arr` remains the same, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `arr1[0] + 1`, `arr1[0]` is a positive integer greater than 1. If `arr1[0]` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute and `temp`, `arr`, `arr2`, and `i` remain the same.**
