According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is a positive integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the value of `temp` being 0 and `i` being incremented by 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute. 

To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted so that `arr1[0]` is a positive integer greater than 1, `temp` remains 0, `arr` remains the same, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, and `i` is incremented by 1. 
State: **`temp` is 0, `arr` remains the same, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr1[0]` is a positive integer greater than 1**
