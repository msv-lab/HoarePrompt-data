Since the loop iterates over `xrange(1, arr[0])`, the loop will execute as long as `arr[0]` is greater than 1. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `arr[0]` needs to be greater than 1. Additionally, since `i` is not used in the loop and `temp` is not relevant for the loop condition, they can remain unchanged. However, `maxval` is not used and can be left as is.

State: **`arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is 0, `arr[0]` is greater than 1**
