According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is less than `arr1[0] + 1 and `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`**
