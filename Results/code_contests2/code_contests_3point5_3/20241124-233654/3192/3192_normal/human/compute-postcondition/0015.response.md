Example Answer: 
If `arr[0]` is less than or equal to 1, the loop will not execute, and `temp` will not be updated. Therefore, the output state is `temp` remains the same, and no elements are appended to `arr`. If the loop does execute, `temp` will be updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, and then `temp` will be appended to `arr`. The state of other variables remains unaffected.
Output State: **`temp` remains the same, no elements are appended to `arr`.**
