According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`, `arr` remains the same, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `arr1[0] + 1`, `arr1[0]` is a positive integer greater than 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
