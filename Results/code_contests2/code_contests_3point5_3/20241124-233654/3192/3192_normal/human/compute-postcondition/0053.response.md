According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`temp` contains the maximum value of each `arr1` list, `arr` contains the maximum value of each `arr1` list, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1` list, `maxval` contains the maximum value found in `arr`, `n` is greater than 0, `arr1[0]` is not equal to 0, `ans` is updated based on the calculation of the code snippet, `i` is incremented by 2, and `ans` is increased by the product of the difference between `maxval` and `arr[i]` multiplied by `arr2[i]`**
