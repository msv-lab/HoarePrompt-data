Example Answer:
The variable `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the current element of `arr` at index `i` and the current value of `maxval`. Since no specific values are given for `arr` or `maxval`, the new value of `maxval` will depend on the elements in `arr`. However, the initial state specifies that `temp` remains the same and no elements are appended to `arr`, so the output state is: `temp` remains the same, no elements are appended to `arr`; `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`.
Output State: **`temp` remains the same, no elements are appended to `arr`; `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`**
