Output State: **`temp` is updated to be the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0]`, `arr` contains the updated `temp`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `arr1[0] + 1, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval. If `arr1[0]` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the values remain the same.**
