Output State: **The loop calculates the sum of products of the differences between `maxval` and each element in `arr` with the corresponding element in `arr2` and stores the result in `ans`. If `n` is 0 or `arr1[0]` is 0, the loop does not execute and the values remain the same. Finally, `ans` is printed.**
