Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is assigned 0, and no elements are appended to `arr`. `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, which is not provided. `i` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is 0, `arr` remains the same, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1` (unknown), `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`temp` is 0, `arr` remains the same, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1` (unknown), `i` is incremented by 1**
