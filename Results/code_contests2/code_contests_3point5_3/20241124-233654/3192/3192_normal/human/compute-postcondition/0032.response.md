According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
- `j` should be less than `arr1[0] + 1` to satisfy the loop condition.
- `temp` should be updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`.
- `arr` should contain the updated `temp`.
- `arr2` should contain the first element of `arr1`.
- `maxval` should be updated to be the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`.

State: **`temp` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`, `arr` contains the updated `temp`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `arr1[0] + 1, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval**`.
