According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `temp` contains the maximum value of each `arr1` list, `arr` contains the maximum value of each `arr1` list, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1` list, `maxval` contains the maximum value found in `arr`, `n` is greater than 0, `arr1[0]` is not equal to 0, `ans` is updated based on the calculation of the code snippet. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1. 
State: **`temp` contains the maximum value of each `arr1` list, `arr` contains the maximum value of each `arr1` list, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1` list, `maxval` contains the maximum value found in `arr`, `n` is greater than 0, `arr1[0]` is not equal to 0, `ans` is updated based on the calculation of the code snippet, `i` is incremented by 1**
