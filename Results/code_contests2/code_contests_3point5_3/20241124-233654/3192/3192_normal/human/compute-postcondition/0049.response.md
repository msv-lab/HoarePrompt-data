According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n` and `arr1[0]`. If `n` is greater than 0 and `arr1[0]` is not equal to 0, the loop will execute. 

To modify the state for the loop to execute:
State: **`temp` contains the maximum value of each `arr1` list, `arr` contains the maximum value of each `arr1` list, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1` list, `maxval` contains the maximum value found in `arr`, `n` is greater than 0, `arr1[0]` is not equal to 0, `ans` is 0**
