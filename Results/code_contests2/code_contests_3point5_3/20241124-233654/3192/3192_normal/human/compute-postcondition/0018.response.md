According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, no elements were appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`temp` remains the same, no elements are appended to `arr`; `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1**
