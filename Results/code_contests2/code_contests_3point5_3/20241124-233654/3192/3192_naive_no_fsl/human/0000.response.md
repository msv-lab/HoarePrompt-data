Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input which consists of the number of companies and the salaries of each employee in each company.
2. It then calculates the maximum salary in each company and stores it in an array `arr`.
3. It also stores the number of employees in each company in another array `arr2`.
4. It calculates the maximum salary across all companies and stores it in `maxval`.
5. Finally, it calculates the minimal total increase of all salaries that allows merging all companies into one by iterating through each company and calculating the increase needed to make the maximum salary equal to `maxval`.
6. The program then prints the total increase required.

The program follows the problem description and correctly calculates the minimal total increase needed to merge all companies into one.
