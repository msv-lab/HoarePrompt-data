Correctness: False

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins. The program only calculates the maximum frequency of any coin value and prints that as the output, which does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description. 

For example, if the input is:
```
6
1 2 4 3 3 2
```
The correct output should be 2, as shown in the problem description. However, the program will output 3 in this case, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program does not work as expected for all potential cases and hence the correctness is False.
