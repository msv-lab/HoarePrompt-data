Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. It only prints the maximum count of a coin value present in the input list, which does not correspond to the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all coins as per the problem description.

For example:
Input
```
6
1 2 2 3 3 3
```
Output
```
3
```
In this case, the program would output `3` while the correct answer should be `2` as the coins can be distributed into two pockets: [1, 2, 3] and [2, 3].
