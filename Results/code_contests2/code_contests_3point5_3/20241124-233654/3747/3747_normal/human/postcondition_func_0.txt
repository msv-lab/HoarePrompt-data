The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of coins, followed by a list `a` of integers representing the values of coins. If `n` is equal to 11, it prints 5. Otherwise, it calculates the frequency of each coin value in the list and prints the maximum frequency. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly.
