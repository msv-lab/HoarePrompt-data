Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code has a special condition where if `n` is equal to 11, it prints 5. This is not part of the original problem description and seems to be a hardcoded edge case. This means that the code is not following the problem description accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the code is false.
