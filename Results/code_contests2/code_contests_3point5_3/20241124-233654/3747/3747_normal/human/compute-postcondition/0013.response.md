Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of coins, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins with at least one element where the first element is 1 and there are more elements to be processed; `c` is a list of 101 zeros except for `c[d]` which is the count of occurrences of the respective coin value `d`. If the list `a` is empty, the loop does not execute and `c` remains a list of 101 zeros.**
