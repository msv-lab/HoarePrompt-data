Example Answer: 
`c[d]` is incremented by 1, where `d` represents the index of the list `c`. Since initially `c` is a list of 101 zeros except for `c[d]`, which is 1, after execution, `c[d]` will be 2. The other elements of list `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of coins, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins with at least 2 elements where the first element is 1 and there is at least one more element to be processed; `c` is a list of 101 zeros except for `c[d]` which is 2.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of coins, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins with at least 2 elements where the first element is 1 and there is at least one more element to be processed; `c` is a list of 101 zeros except for `c[d]` which is 2**
