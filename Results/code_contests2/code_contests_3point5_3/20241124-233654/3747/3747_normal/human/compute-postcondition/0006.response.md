According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the list `c` is not relevant to the loop execution. Since `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins, for the loop to execute, the first element of `a` must be 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of coins, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins with at least 1 element where the first element is 1, `c` is a list of 101 zeros**
