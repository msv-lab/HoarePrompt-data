According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are still elements in the list `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer representing the number of coins, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins with at least 1 element where the first element is 1; `c` is a list of 101 zeros except for `c[d]` which is 1. Since the loop iterates through the elements in list `a`, for the loop to execute one more time, there should be at least one more element in list `a` that has not been processed yet. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` should have at least one more element that has not been processed yet.
State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of coins, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins with at least 2 elements where the first element is 1 and there is at least one more element to be processed; `c` is a list of 101 zeros except for `c[d]` which is 1**
