The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it uses the parameter constraints provided: `n` is an integer representing the number of coins (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for each coin). The function calculates and returns the total sum of all the values of coins in the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It calculates and returns the total sum of the values of coins in the list `a`, where `n` represents the number of coins and each coin's value is represented by `a_i` in the list `a`.**
