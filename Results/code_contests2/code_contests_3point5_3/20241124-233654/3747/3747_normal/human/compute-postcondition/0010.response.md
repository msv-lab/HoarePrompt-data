According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in the list `a` to be processed, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer representing the number of coins, `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins with at least 2 elements, and `c` is a list of 101 zeros except for `c[d]` which is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in list `a` needs to be processed. So, the state that needs to be adjusted is the next element in list `a` needs to be processed.
State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of coins, `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins with at least 3 elements, and the next element in list `a` needs to be processed; `c` is a list of 101 zeros except for `c[d]` which is 2**
