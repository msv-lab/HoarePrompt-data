Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values of integers after splitting the input. The values in the list `a` represent the values of coins. The range for each coin value is 1 to 100. The number of coins `n` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of coins, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for each coin.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of coins, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for each coin**
