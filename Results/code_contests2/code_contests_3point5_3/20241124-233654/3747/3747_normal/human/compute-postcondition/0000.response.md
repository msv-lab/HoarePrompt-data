Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the integer value from user input. The value of `n` represents the number of coins. The list `a` representing the values of the coins is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of coins, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for each coin.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of coins, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for each coin**
