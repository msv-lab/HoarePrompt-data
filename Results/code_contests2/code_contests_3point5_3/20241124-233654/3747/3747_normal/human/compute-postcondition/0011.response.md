Example Answer:
The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1. `d` represents the index of the element in list `a` that needs to be processed. The previous value of `c[d]` is 2, so after execution, `c[d]` becomes 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of coins, `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins with at least 3 elements, and the next element in list `a` needs to be processed; `c` is a list of 101 zeros except for `c[d]` which is 3.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of coins, `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins with at least 3 elements, and the next element in list `a` needs to be processed; `c` is a list of 101 zeros except for `c[d]` which is 3**
