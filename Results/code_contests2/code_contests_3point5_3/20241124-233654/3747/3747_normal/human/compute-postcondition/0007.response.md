Example Answer:
The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `c` is a list of 101 zeros, so after execution, `c[d]` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of coins, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins with at least 1 element where the first element is 1; `c` is a list of 101 zeros except for `c[d]` which is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of coins, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers representing the values of coins with at least 1 element where the first element is 1; `c` is a list of 101 zeros except for `c[d]` which is 1**
