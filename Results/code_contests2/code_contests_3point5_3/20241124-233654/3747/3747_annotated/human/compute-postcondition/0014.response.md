Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 with remaining elements, `c` is a list of 101 zeros with the value at index `d` increased by the number of occurrences of `d` in list `a`. If list `a` is empty, the loop does not execute and `c` remains a list of 101 zeros. The maximum value in list `c` is printed.**
