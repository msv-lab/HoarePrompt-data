Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The list `a` contains `n` integers, and each integer is between 1 and 100. Therefore, the output state is: n is an input integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100.
Output State: **n is an input integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100**
