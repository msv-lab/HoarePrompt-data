Example Answer:
The value at index `d` in list `c` is increased by 1. The initial state specifies that all elements in list `c` are 0 except the value at index `d` which is increased by 2. After execution, the value at index `d` in list `c` will be increased by 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 with remaining elements, `c` is a list of 101 zeros with the value at index `d` increased by 3.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 with remaining elements, `c` is a list of 101 zeros with the value at index `d` increased by 3**
