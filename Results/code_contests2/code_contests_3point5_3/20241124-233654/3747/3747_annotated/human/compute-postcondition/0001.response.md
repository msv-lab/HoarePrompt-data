Example Answer: 
The list `a` is assigned the values inputted by the user after converting them into integers. Since `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, and the elements of `a` are also integers between 1 and 100, the output state is: n is an input integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100.
Output State: **n is an input integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100**
