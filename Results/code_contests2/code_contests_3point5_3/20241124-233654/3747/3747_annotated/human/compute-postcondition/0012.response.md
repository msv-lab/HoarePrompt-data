According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in list `a`. If there are more elements left in the list `a`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 with remaining elements, `d` is one of the remaining elements in list `a`, `c` is a list of 101 zeros with the value at index `d` increased by 4. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` needs to have at least one more element left after the previous iteration. Therefore, `n` remains the same, `a` should have at least one more element, `d` should be updated to the next remaining element in list `a`, and `c` should be adjusted accordingly.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 with at least one more element remaining, `d` is the next remaining element in list `a`, `c` is a list of 101 zeros with the value at index `d` increased by 4**
