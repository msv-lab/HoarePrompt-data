Example Answer:
The value at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. The previous values of variables are known, so after execution, the value at index `d` in list `c` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, c is a list of 101 zeros with the value at index `d` increased by 1.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, c is a list of 101 zeros with the value at index `d` increased by 1**
