According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `a` has at least one integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one integer. Before the loop starts, `n` is already defined as the number of elements in list `a`, so it does not need to be adjusted. Additionally, since `c` is a list of 101 zeros, it does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `a` has at least one integer.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, c is a list of 101 zeros, a has at least one integer**
