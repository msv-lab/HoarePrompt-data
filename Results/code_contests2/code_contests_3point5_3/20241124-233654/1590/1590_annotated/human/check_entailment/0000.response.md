Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect. 

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when there are multiple passengers arriving at the same floor at the same time. The program does not handle this case correctly because it only considers the expected time of arrival for each passenger without taking into account the possibility of multiple passengers arriving simultaneously. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the total time needed to bring all passengers to floor 0.

Therefore, the program needs to be modified to handle the scenario where multiple passengers arrive at the same floor at the same time to ensure correctness.
