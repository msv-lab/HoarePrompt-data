The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `s`, and multiple pairs of integers `(fi, ti)`. It then calculates the time_passed based on the differences between current time and expected time in the pairs. The function prints the final time_passed value after processing all pairs. The code does not handle cases where `n` is negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
