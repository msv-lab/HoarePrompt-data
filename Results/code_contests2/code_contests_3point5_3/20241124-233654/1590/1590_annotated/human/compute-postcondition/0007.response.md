Example Answer:
A new tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the existing list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are not specified in the initial state, so the only change is the addition of the new tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer within the specified range, `p` contains multiple tuples including the newly appended `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer within the specified range, `p` contains multiple tuples including the newly appended `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1**
