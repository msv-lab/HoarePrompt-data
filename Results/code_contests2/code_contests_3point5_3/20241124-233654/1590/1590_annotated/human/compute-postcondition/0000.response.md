Example Answer:
`n` and `s` are assigned values using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `n` and `s` are unknown initially, but they are positive integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `s` are positive integers within the specified ranges.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are positive integers within the specified ranges**
