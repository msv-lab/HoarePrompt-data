According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer, `p` contains multiple tuples including the newly appended `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer, `p` contains multiple tuples including the newly appended `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 3**
