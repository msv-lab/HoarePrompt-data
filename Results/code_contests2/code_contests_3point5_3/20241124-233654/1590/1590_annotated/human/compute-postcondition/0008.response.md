According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer within the specified range, `p` contains multiple tuples including the newly appended `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1 at the end of the last iteration, it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer within the specified range, `p` contains multiple tuples including the newly appended `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2**
