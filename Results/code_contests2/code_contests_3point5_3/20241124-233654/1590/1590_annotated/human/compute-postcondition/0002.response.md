According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `p` is an empty list, so it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer within the specified range, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
