The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function does not return any value directly, but it performs the following tasks based on the preconditions:

1. Generate a random number of elements `n` within the range of 1 to 100.
2. Generate a random sum `s` within the range of 1 to 1000.
3. Generate `n` pairs of positive integers (`fi`, `ti`) where `fi` is within the range of 1 to `s` and `ti` is within the range of 1 to 1000.
4. Calculate the sum of products of `fi` and `ti` for all `n` pairs.
5. If the sum of products is greater than or equal to the random sum `s`, print "Success" indicating that the sum was achieved; otherwise, print "Failure" indicating that the sum was not achieved.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to generate random values for `n`, `s`, `fi`, and `ti`, calculate the sum of products of `fi` and `ti`, and determine if the sum is greater than or equal to `s`, printing "Success" or "Failure" accordingly.
