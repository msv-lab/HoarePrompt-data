According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer within the specified range, `p` contains a tuple `(fi, ti)`, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer within the specified range, `p` contains a tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1**
