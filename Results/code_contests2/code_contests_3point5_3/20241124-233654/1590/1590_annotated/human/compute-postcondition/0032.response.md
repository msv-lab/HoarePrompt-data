According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is still sorted, `time_passed` is increased by `p[i][1] - time_passed` where `i` is 2 if `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`. The value of `time_passed` is updated based on the condition. The values of `n`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `time_passed` is less than `p[2][1]`, then the `time_passed` should be increased by `p[2][1] - time_passed`.
- `i` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
- No other states need adjustment.

State: **`p` is still sorted, `time_passed` is increased by `p[2][1] - time_passed` where `time_passed` is less than `p[2][1] and i` is 3, `n`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged**
