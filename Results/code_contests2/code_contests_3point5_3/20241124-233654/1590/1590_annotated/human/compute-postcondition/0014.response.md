Example Answer: 
A tuple `(0, 0)` is appended to the sorted list `p`. Since the list `p` was already sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, adding a new tuple will not change the sorting order. Therefore, the Output State is: After sorting the list of tuples in `p` based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, `p` is still sorted.
Output State: **After sorting the list of tuples in `p` based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, `p` is still sorted**
