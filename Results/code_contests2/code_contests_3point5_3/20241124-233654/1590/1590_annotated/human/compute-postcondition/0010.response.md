Example Answer:
A new tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned from the input split. The variable `i` remains 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer within the specified range, `p` contains multiple tuples including the newly appended `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer within the specified range, `p` contains multiple tuples including the newly appended `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2**
