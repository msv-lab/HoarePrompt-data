The function accepts no parameters. It reads input for the number of passengers and time intervals, simulates passenger arrivals and departures in a building with multiple floors, calculates the total time taken for all passengers to reach their respective floors, and then prints the total time taken. If the number of passengers is 0, no simulation occurs, and the total time is 0.
