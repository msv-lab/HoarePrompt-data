Output State: **`time_passed` is updated based on the calculation, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is a list, and the value of `s` is updated to the first element of the list `p` at index `i`. If `time_passed` is less than the second element of the list `p` at index `i`, `time_passed` is increased by the difference between the second element of the list `p` at index `i` and the current `time_passed`, `i` is incremented by 1**
