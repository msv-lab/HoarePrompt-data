Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input separated by a space, and `s` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input. The `map` function converts the input values to integers. The output state is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, s is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, s is a positive integer between 1 and 1000**
