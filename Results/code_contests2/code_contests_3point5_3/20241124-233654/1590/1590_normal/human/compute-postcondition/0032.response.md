According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `time_passed` is updated, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is updated to the first element of the list `p` at index `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is increased by the difference between `p[i][1]` and `time_passed`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the conditions related to `time_passed`, `n`, and the list `p` need to be updated based on the loop logic. 

State: **`time_passed` is updated based on the calculation, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is updated to the first element of the list `p` at index `i+1`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
