According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 3**
