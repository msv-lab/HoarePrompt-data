According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input split, and a new tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to `p`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input split, and a new tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to `p**.
