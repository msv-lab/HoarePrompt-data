Postcondition: ***`time_passed` may be updated based on the calculation. `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. `s` is updated to the first element of the list `p` at index `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If time_passed < p[i][1], then time_passed is updated to be the difference between p[i][1] and the current time_passed. This ensures that time_passed is adjusted based on the difference between the expected time at index i in list p and the current time_passed.***
