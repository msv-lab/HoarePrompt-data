According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. As `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is within the specified range and `i` is initialized to 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
