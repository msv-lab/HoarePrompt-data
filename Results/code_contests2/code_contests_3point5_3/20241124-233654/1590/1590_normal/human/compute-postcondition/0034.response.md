Example Answer:
If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and time_passed remains 0. s remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and p remains an empty list. Since the code only prints the value of time_passed, the other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **If n is 0, time_passed remains 0, s remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000, p remains an empty list.**
