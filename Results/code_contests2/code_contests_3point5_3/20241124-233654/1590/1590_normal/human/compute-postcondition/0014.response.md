Output State: **After appending the tuple `(0, 0)` to list `p`, the updated `p` now contains an additional tuple `(0, 0)`. `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `p` contains tuples with values `(fi, ti)` for each iteration of the loop. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `p` remains an empty list.**
