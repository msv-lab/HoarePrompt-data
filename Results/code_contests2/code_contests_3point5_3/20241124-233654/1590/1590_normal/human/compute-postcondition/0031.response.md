Postcondition: ***`time_passed` is updated based on the calculation. `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. `s` is updated to the first element of the list `p` at index `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is increased by the difference between `p[i][1]` and `time_passed`. This update covers cases where the condition is met and where it is not met, ensuring that the state of the variables is correctly maintained after the execution of the if statement.***
