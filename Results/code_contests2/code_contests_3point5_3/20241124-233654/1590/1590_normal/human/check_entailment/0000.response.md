Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code accurately reads the input for the number of passengers and time intervals, simulates passenger arrivals and departures in a building with multiple floors, calculates the total time taken for all passengers to reach their respective floors, and prints the total time taken.
- It correctly handles the scenario when the number of passengers is 0, resulting in a total time of 0 seconds.
- The logic of the code aligns with the problem description provided, ensuring that all passengers are brought to floor 0 with the minimum amount of time needed.
- There are no edge cases identified where the code fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
