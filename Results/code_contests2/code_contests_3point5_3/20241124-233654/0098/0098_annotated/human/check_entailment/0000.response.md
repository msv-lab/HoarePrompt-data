Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the mathematical expression needed to find the minimum length of a side of the square in which the 2n-gon can be embedded. The formula used in the program is mathematically correct and aligns with the problem description. Since the program directly calculates the required value without any conditional logic or potential edge cases, it is safe to assume that it will work correctly for all test cases within the specified constraints.
