Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes an odd integer n as input and calculates the minimum length of a side of the square 2n-gon can be embedded in using the formula `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`.
- The code is correctly structured to loop through the test cases and calculate the output for each case.
- The formula used in the code aligns with the problem description, which requires finding the minimum size of a square that can embed a 2n-gon.
- Since the code follows the problem description and the output hints confirm the correctness of the formula used, we can conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases.
