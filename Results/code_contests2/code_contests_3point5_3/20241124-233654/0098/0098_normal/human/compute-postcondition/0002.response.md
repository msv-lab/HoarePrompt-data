Functionality: ** The function accepts an odd integer n within the range 3 <= n <= 199 and returns the result of math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)). **

Note: The function is expected to work correctly for odd integers within the specified range. However, there is no check in place to ensure that the input is within this range. If an even integer or an integer outside the specified range is provided, the function may encounter mathematical errors or unexpected results.
