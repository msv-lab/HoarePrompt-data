Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program calculates the minimum length of a side of the square in which a 2n-gon can be embedded. The formula used in the program is mathematically correct and provides the correct output for all potential cases within the given constraints. The program uses the cosine and sine trigonometric functions to calculate the side length of the square based on the input value of n.

Since the program is using the correct mathematical formula and produces the expected output for all test cases within the specified constraints, we can conclude that the program is correct.
