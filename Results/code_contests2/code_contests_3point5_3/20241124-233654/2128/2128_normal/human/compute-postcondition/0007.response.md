Example Answer:
The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The values of `n` and `k` are already assigned from input, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, after execution, `k` will be one less than the original value of `n`. 
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from input, `arr` is a list containing integers from input sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of the sorted `arr` list, `k` is one less than the original value of `n`**
