Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order, `ans` is the maximum value in the list. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is updated to be `n - 1`. The overall state of the program after the if-else block ensures that `k` will not exceed `n - 1` to prevent any out-of-bound issues.***
