Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in descending order using the `sorted()` function with the `reverse=True` parameter. The previous values of the list `arr` are unknown, but after sorting, the list `arr` is now in descending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order**
