Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `k`, `i` are integers greater than or equal to 0. `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with `ans` assigned as the first element of `arr`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is updated to be `n - 1`. In all cases, the initial values and relationships between the variables remain the same, with `k` being one less than the original value of `n` if `k >= n`.***
