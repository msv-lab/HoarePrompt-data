Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the standard input, then iterates `t` times. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of integers `arr`. It sorts the list `arr` in descending order, calculates the sum of the first `k` elements (or `n - 1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`), and prints the result. The function does not return any value. Note: The function lacks input parameter handling and error checking. **
