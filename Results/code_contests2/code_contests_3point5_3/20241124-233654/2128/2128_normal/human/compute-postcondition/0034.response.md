According to the code, the loop can execute at least once if `k` is a valid value between 1 and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in the list. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it needs to be adjusted to `n - 1` for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in the list, `k` is a valid value between 1 and `n`, `k` is less than `n`, `k` is not less than 1**
