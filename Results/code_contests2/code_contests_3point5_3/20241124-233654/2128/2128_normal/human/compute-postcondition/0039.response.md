Example Answer: 
`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The value of `n` is unknown, but `ans` contains the largest element in the list. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` contains the largest element in the list; `k` is n - 1.
Output State: **`ans` contains the largest element in the list; `k` is n - 1**
