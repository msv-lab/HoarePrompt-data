Example Answer:
The input received from `sys.stdin.readline()` is split into integers and stored in a list `arr`. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the split input values. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from input, `arr` is a list containing integers from input**
