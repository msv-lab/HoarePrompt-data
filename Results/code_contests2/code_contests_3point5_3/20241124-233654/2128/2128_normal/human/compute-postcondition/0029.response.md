According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order, `ans` is the maximum value in the list plus the value at index 1 of `arr`, `k` is a valid value between 1 and `n`, `l` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order, `ans` is the maximum value in the list plus the value at index 1 of `arr`, `k` is a valid value between 1 and `n`, `l` is 3**
