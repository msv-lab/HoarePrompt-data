Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in descending order. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from input, `arr` is a list containing integers from input sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from input, `arr` is a list containing integers from input sorted in descending order**
