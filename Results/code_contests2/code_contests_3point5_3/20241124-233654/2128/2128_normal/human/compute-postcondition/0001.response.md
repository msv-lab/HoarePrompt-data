According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is assigned the integer value obtained from reading input from the standard input stream. 
Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` starts at 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
