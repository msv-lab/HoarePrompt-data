Output State: **The loop calculates the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted `arr` list and updates `ans` accordingly. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is adjusted to be `n - 1`. The loop executes at least once if `k` is a valid value between 1 and `n`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. After the loop, `ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in the list.**
