Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, so if `n` has a value from the input, `k` will be one less than that value. The list `arr` contains integers from the input sorted in descending order, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order, `ans` is the maximum value in the list.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order, `ans` is the maximum value in the list**
