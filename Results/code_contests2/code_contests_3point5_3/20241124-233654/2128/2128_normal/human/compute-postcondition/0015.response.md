According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k`, `i` are integers greater than or equal to 0, with `k` being one less than the original value of `n` if `k >= n`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with `ans` incremented by the value at index `l + 1` in `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the loop index `l` must be less than `k`.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `i` are integers greater than or equal to 0, with `k` being one less than the original value of `n` if `k >= n`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with `ans` incremented by the value at index `l + 1` in `arr`, `l` is less than `k`**
