Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `arr`, which is the maximum value since the list is sorted in descending order. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order, `ans` is the maximum value in the list.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order, `ans` is the maximum value in the list**
