Example Answer:
The code snippet takes input values split by a space and maps them to integers to create a list `arr`. The initial state indicates that `ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in the list. After executing the code, the list `arr` is created with the provided input values. Since `k` and `n` are not directly affected by the code snippet, they retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in the list, `k` is a valid value between 1 and `n`, `k` is less than `n`, `k` is not less than 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input split by space.
Output State: **`ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in the list, `k` is a valid value between 1 and `n`, `k` is less than `n`, `k` is not less than 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input split by space**
