According to the code, the loop can execute again if `l` is less than `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`, `k` is reassigned to `n-1`, `ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of `arr`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be reassigned to `n`, and `l` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`, `k` is reassigned to `n`, `ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of `arr`, `l` is 2**
