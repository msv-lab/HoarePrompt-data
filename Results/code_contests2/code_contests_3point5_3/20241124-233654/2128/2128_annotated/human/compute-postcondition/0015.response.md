At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` needs to be reassigned to the value of `n` since it was mentioned that `k` is reassigned to `n`.
- `l` needs to be incremented by 1 to continue iterating through the range.
- `ans` needs to be increased by the value of `arr[l]` to update the sum of the first and third elements of `arr`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is reassigned to `n`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first and third elements of `arr`, `l` is 4, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`**
