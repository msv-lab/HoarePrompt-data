According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `l` is within the range of 1 to `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` contains the sum of the first `k + 1` elements in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, `k` is updated to `n - 1` if `k` was initially greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `k` remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is incremented by 1, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `l` needs to be incremented by 1 to allow the loop to execute again.
- `ans` needs to be updated to include the next element in `arr` at index `l + 1`.

State: **`ans` contains the sum of the first `k + 1` elements in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, `k` is updated to `n - 1` if `k` was initially greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `k` remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is incremented by 1, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l + 1]**.
