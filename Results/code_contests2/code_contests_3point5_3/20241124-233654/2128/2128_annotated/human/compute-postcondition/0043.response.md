According to the code, the loop can execute again if `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, `k` is updated to `n - 1` if `k` was initially greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `k` remains the same, `n` is greater than 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` needs to be updated to `n - 1` if `k` was initially greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `k` remains the same.
- `l` needs to be incremented by 1.
