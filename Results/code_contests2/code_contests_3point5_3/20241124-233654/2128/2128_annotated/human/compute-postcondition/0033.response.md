Example Answer:
If the condition of the loop is met, `ans` will be printed which contains the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`. The value of `i` is increased by 1. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: If the condition is met, `ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`, and `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **If the condition is met, `ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`, and `i` is increased by 1**
