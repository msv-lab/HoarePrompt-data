Output State: **If t is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once and perform the following operations: read two integers n and k, sort an array arr in descending order, calculate ans as the sum of the first k elements of arr, print ans. If k is greater than or equal to n, k is updated to n - 1. After each iteration, i is increased by 1. If t is 0, the loop does not execute.**
