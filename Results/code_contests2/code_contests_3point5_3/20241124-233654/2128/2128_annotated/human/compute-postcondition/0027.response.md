According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `l` is in the range from 1 to `k` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k` are at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` contains the sum of the first `l` elements in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` should be adjusted to the next value in the range from 1 to `k` inclusive.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` contains the sum of the first `l+1` elements in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1**
