According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `l` is in the range from 1 to `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t`, `n`, `k` are at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` contains the sum of the first `l+1` elements in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is `l` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t`, `n`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` contains the sum of the first `l+2` elements in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l+1]`**
