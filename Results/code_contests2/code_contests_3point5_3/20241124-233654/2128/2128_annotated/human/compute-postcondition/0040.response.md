Postcondition: ***`ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr` and `i` is increased by 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is updated to `n - 1`. In case `k` was initially greater than or equal to `n`, the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr` remains the same, and `i` is still increased by 1. If `k` was less than `n`, the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr` remains unchanged as well, and `i` is still increased by 1.***
