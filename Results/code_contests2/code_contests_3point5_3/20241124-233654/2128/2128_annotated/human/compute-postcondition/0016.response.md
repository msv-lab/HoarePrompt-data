Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. The loop calculates the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted `arr` list and adds it to `ans`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is reassigned to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute. After the loop, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain as input integers, `arr` is still sorted in descending order, and `ans` contains the sum of the selected elements from `arr`.**
