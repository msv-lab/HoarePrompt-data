Example Answer: 
`k` is assigned the value `n - 1`, and `n` is not given in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `k` cannot be determined. The value of `i` is increased by 1, but the initial value of `i` is also unknown. Therefore, the output state is uncertain.
Output State: **Uncertain output state**
