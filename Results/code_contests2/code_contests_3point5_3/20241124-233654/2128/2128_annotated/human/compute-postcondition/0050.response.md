According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` contains the sum of the first `k + l` elements in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, `k` is updated to `n - 1` if `k` was initially greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `k` remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is incremented by 1, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`ans` contains the sum of the first `k + (l + 1)` elements in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, `k` is updated to `n - 1` if `k` was initially greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `k` remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is incremented by 1, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l + 1]`.**
