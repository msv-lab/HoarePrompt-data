Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in reverse order. The previous values of `arr` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact order of elements. Therefore, the output state is: If the condition is met, `ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`, and `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **If the condition is met, `ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`, and `i` is increased by 1**
