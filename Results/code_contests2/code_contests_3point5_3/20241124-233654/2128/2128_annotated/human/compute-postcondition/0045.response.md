According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `ans` needs to be updated to contain the sum of the first `k + 1` elements in `arr`.
- `i` needs to be increased by 1.
- `k` needs to be updated to `n - 1` if `k` was initially greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `k` remains the same.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `l` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`ans` contains the sum of the first `k + 1` elements in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, `k` is updated to `n - 1` if `k` was initially greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `k` remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is incremented by 1**
