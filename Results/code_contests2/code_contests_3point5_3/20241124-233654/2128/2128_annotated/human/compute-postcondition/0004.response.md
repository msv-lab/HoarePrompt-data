Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in descending order. The previous values of `arr` are not provided, so the output state is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is sorted in descending order**
