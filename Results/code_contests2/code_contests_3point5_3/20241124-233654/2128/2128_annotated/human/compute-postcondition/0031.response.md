According to the code, the loop can execute if `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` contains the sum of the first `l+2` elements in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l+1]`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `k+1`.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` contains the sum of the first `l+2` elements in `arr`, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l+1]`, `l` is less than or equal to `k+1`**
