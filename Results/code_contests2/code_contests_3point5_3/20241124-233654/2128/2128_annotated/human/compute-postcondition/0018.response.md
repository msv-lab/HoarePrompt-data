According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `t`, `n`, and `k` are input integers, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` contains the sum of selected elements from `arr`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which represents the current iteration. It should be incremented by 1.
State: **`t`, `n`, and `k` are input integers, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` contains the sum of selected elements from `arr`, `i` is increased by 1**
