Example Answer: 
`ans` is increased by the value at index 2 of `arr`, and `l` is 2. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`, after adding the value at index 2 of `arr` to `ans`, the new value of `ans` will be the sum of the first and third elements of `arr`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first and third elements of `arr`, `k` is reassigned to `n`, and `l` is 2.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first and third elements of `arr`, `k` is reassigned to `n`, `l` is 2**
