Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr`, so `ans` now holds the value of `arr[0]`. The values of `k` and `i` are not mentioned in the code snippet, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`, and `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`, and `i` is increased by 1**
