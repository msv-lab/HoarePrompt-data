Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values by mapping integers from standard input after splitting by space. The values are read from standard input, so the initial value of `t` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are input integers.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are input integers**
