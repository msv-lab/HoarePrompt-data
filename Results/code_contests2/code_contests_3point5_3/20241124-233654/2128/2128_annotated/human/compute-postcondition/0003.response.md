Example Answer:
The code reads a line of integers from the standard input and converts them into a list of integers assigned to `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are input integers.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are input integers**
