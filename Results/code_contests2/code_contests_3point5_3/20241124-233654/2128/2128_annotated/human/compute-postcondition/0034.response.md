According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if the condition is met, `ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`, and `i` is increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If the condition is met, `ans` contains the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`, and `i` is increased by 1**
