Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input data for multiple test cases, sorts an array in descending order, calculates the sum of specific elements in the array, and prints the results. If the value of `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is adjusted to `n - 1`. The function does not return any value but performs operations on the input data based on the given constraints.**
