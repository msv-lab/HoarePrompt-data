Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible difference between the maximum and minimum amount of water in the barrels based on the given constraints. It sorts the array of barrel capacities in descending order and then iterates over the array to pour water into barrels up to the limit of k times. The final answer is then calculated and printed. The program handles the cases where k is greater than or equal to n appropriately. Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case provided in the problem statement, it is considered correct.
