Example Answer:
The code snippet compares the rotated versions of string `t` to string `s` to check if `s` is a rotated version of `t`. If any rotation of `t` matches `s`, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The variables `S` and `T` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters**
