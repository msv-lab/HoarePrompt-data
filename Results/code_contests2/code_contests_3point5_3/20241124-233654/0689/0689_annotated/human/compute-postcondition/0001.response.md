Example Answer:
The value of `t` is assigned the input string using `raw_input()`. The length of `t` is the same as the length of `s`, and both `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters. Therefore, the output state is: `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, `s` is assigned the input string, `t` is assigned the input string.
Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, `s` is assigned the input string, `t` is assigned the input string**
