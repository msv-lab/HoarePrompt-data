Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes two input strings `s` and `t`, and then checks if `s` equals `t` after rotation. It does this by generating all possible rotations of `t` and checking if any of them match `s`. The program then prints "Yes" if there is a match, and "No" otherwise. This logic correctly implements the problem description and all the provided examples work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
