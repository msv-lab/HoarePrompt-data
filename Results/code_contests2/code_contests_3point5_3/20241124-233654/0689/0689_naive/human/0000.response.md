Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly determines if string S equals string T after rotation. It generates all possible rotations of string T and checks if any of them equals string S. The comparison is done for all possible rotations by concatenating the last part of T with the first part, and then checking if it matches S. The program then uses a list comprehension to check if any of these rotations are equal to S. If any rotation matches S, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.

The program covers all potential cases where S equals T after rotation, as it checks all possible rotations of T. For example, if S is "kyoto" and T is "tokyo", after rotation, T becomes "otoky". The program correctly identifies this case as a match and outputs 'Yes'. Similarly, for the case where S and T are equal, the program correctly identifies that S equals T after rotation and outputs 'Yes'.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the program logic and the provided examples, the correctness is evaluated as True.
