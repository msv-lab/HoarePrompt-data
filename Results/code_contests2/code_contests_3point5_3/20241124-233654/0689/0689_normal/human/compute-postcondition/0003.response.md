The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to compare two strings `S` and `T`, where both strings consist of lowercase English letters and have lengths between 2 and 100, and the lengths of the strings are equal. The function does not return any values, but it is assumed to perform some comparison or operation on the two strings `S` and `T`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to compare two strings `S` and `T` of equal length.
