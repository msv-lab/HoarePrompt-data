Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string. Since the initial state mentions that S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100, the output state is `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|, `s` is the input string.
Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|, `s` is the input string**
