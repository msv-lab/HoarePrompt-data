Example Answer: 
The code compares all possible rotations of string `t` with string `s` to check if they are equal. If any rotation matches `s`, it will print 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The strings `S` and `T` are not modified, and the program only prints either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison result. 
Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|, `s` is the input string, `t` is the input string**
