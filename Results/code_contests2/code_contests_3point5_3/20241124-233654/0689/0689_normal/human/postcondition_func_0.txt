The function `func` reads two strings `s` and `t` as input from the user, where both strings consist of lowercase English letters and have lengths between 2 and 100. It then compares the two strings by rotating `t` in different positions and checking if it equals `s`. The comparison result is printed as either 'No' or 'Yes'. The function does not return any value.
