Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes input strings `s` and `t`, both consisting of lowercase English letters, and determines if `s` equals `t` after rotation. It achieves this by rotating `t` in different positions and checking if it equals `s`. If `s` equals `t` after any rotation, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The code correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement and the output matches the expected output as per the given description. The code covers all potential cases and correctly determines if `s` equals `t` after rotation.
