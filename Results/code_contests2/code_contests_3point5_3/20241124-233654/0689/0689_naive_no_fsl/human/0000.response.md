Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes two inputs, S and T, and then checks if T can be formed by rotating S. It iterates through all possible rotations of T and checks if any of them match S. This approach covers all possible cases and accurately determines if S equals T after rotation. The program follows the problem description and works correctly for all inputs.
