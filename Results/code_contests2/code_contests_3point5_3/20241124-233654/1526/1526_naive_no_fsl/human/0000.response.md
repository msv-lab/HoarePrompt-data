Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input string and creates a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character. It then iterates over the values of the dictionary and checks if each count is even. If any count is odd, it sets the result to False, otherwise, it remains True. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if the result is True and 'No' if it is False.

The program follows the problem description by checking if each lowercase letter occurs an even number of times in the input string. It handles all potential cases by correctly counting the occurrences and checking if they are even. Therefore, the program is correct.
