Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` reads an input string `s`, counts the occurrences of each character in `s`, and determines if the count of each character is even. It then prints 'Yes' if all character counts are even, 'No' otherwise. The code handles the constraint that the input string consists of lowercase letters. Additionally, the code correctly handles the case where the string is empty by printing 'Yes' as there are no odd counts to invalidate the result. The logic matches the problem description for all potential cases, making the code correct.
