The function `func_1` reads an input string `s`, counts the occurrences of each character in `s`, and determines if the count of each character is even. It then prints 'Yes' if all character counts are even, 'No' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters, and it assumes `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters. If `s` is empty, the function prints 'Yes' as there are no odd counts to invalidate the result.
