Example Answer:
If `c` is not in `memo`, `memo[c]` is assigned the value of 1. If `c` is already in `memo`, `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. All other key-value pairs in `memo` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty, and the key-value pairs in `memo` are updated accordingly.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty, and the key-value pairs in `memo` are updated accordingly**
