According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must still have characters left to iterate over.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty, and the key-value pairs in `memo` are updated accordingly**
