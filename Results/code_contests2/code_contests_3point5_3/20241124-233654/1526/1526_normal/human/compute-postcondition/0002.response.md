According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the input string `s` is not empty. Before the loop starts, `w` being a string consisting of lowercase letters and `memo` being an empty dictionary does not have any direct impact on the loop execution. 
Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty, `memo` is an empty dictionary**
