Output State: **After the loop executes, `w` remains as a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty. The dictionary `memo` contains key-value pairs where each key `c` in `s` has been updated to count the occurrences of `c` in `s`. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, leaving `memo` as an empty dictionary.**
