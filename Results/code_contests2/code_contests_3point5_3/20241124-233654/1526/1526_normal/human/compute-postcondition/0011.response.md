According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters in the string `s` to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty, `memo[c]` is assigned the value of 0 if `c` is not present in `memo`, and if `c` is already in `memo`, `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. All other key-value pairs in `memo` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in the string `s` needs to be considered. So, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty, `memo[c]` is assigned the value of 0 if `c` is not present in `memo`, if `c` is already in `memo`, `memo[c]` is incremented by 1, all other key-value pairs in `memo` remain unchanged**.
