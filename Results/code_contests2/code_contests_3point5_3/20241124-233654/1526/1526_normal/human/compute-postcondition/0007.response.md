According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty, `memo[c]` is incremented by 1 if `c` is present in `memo`, else `memo[c]` is added with a value of 1. All other key-value pairs in `memo` remain unchanged. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must still not be empty.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty, `memo[c]` is incremented by 1 if `c` is present in `memo`, else `memo[c]` is added with a value of 1. All other key-value pairs in `memo` remain unchanged**
