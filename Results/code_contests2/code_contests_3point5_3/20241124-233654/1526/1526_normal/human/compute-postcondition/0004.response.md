Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is assigned the value 0. Since `c` is not a key in the dictionary `memo`, a new key-value pair is created. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty, `memo` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair `{c: 0}`.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty, `memo` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair `{c: 0}`**
