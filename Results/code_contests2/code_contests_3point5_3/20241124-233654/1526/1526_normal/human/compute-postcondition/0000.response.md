Example Answer: 
`s` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes input from the user. Since the initial state does not have any specific value for `w`, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string**
