According to the code, the loop will execute if the dictionary `memo` is not empty. The loop iterates over the values of `memo`, so for the loop to execute, `memo` must have at least one key-value pair. 
At the end of the loop, `w` remains as a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty, and `result` is True. For the loop to execute, the dictionary `memo` must have at least one key-value pair. 
State: **`w` remains as a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty, dictionary `memo` contains at least one key-value pair, `result` is True**.
