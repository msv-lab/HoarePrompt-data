Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input string `w`.
2. It then creates a dictionary `memo` to store the count of each character in the string.
3. It then iterates over the values in the dictionary and checks if the count of each character is even.
4. If any character count is odd, it sets the result to `False`.
5. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if result is `True` (i.e., all characters have even counts) and 'No' otherwise.
6. The program covers all potential cases and correctly determines if the input string is beautiful according to the problem description.
