Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly determines whether a given string is beautiful based on the problem description. It counts the frequency of each character in the string and checks if all frequencies are even. If any frequency is odd, it sets the result to False. The final output is 'Yes' if the result is True and 'No' otherwise. The program handles all potential cases and works as expected for the problem description.
