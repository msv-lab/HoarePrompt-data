According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `memo`. If `memo` is not empty, meaning it has at least one key-value pair, the loop will execute. If `s` is empty, `memo` will remain an empty dictionary. At the end of the loop, `result` is True. So for the loop to be executed, `s` should not be empty, `memo` should have at least one key-value pair, and `x` should be the value corresponding to the first key in the dictionary.
State: **If `s` is not empty, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `x` is the value corresponding to the first key in the dictionary, `result` is True**
