Example Answer: 
`raw_input()` accepts an input and assigns it to `s`. Since `w` is not mentioned in the code snippet, the value of `w` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is assigned the input value.
Output State: **w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is assigned the input value**
