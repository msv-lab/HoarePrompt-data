According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is assigned the input value and is not empty, `memo` is a dictionary where the key `c` is set to 0 if `c` is not already present in `memo`, `c` is the next character in `s`, and `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next character `c` in the string `s` should be available. The states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is assigned the input value and is not empty, `memo` is a dictionary where the key `c` is set to 0 if `c` is not already present in `memo`, `c` is the next character in `s`, and `memo[c]` is incremented by 1**
