Output State: **If `s` is not empty, after the loop executes, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key, and the corresponding value is the frequency of `c` in `s`, and `result` is True if all values in `memo` are even. If `s` is empty, `memo` remains an empty dictionary, and `result` is True. If any value in `memo` is odd, `result` is set to False and the loop breaks. The program prints 'Yes' if `result` is True, and 'No' if `result` is False.**
