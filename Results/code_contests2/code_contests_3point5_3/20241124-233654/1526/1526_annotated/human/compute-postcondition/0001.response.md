Example Answer:
The dictionary `memo` is initialized as an empty dictionary. Since `s` is not used in the code snippet, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is assigned the input value, `memo` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is assigned the input value, `memo` is an empty dictionary**
