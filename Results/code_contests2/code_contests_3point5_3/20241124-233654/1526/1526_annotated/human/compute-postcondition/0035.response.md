Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads a string `s` from the user input, counts the frequency of each character in the string, and checks if all frequencies are even. If all frequencies are even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
