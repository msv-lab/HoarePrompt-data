Postcondition: ***If `s` is not empty and `memo` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs where `x` corresponds to the third key, then after the execution of the if statement, `result` is False only if `x % 2` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `result` remains True. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
