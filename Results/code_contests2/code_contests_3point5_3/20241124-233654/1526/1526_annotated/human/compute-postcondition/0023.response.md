According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more values in the `memo` dictionary. At the end of the last iteration, if `s` is not empty, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `x` is the value corresponding to the first key in the dictionary, and `result` is True. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more key-value pairs in the `memo` dictionary. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If s is not empty, memo is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, x is the value corresponding to the second key in the dictionary, and result is True**
