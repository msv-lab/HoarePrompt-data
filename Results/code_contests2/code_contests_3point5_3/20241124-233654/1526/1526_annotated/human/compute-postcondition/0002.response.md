According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value `s`. If `s` is not an empty string, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `w` being a string consisting of lowercase letters does not directly affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must not be an empty string, and `c` will be the first character in `s`.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is assigned the input value and is not empty, `memo` is an empty dictionary, `c` is the first character in `s`**
