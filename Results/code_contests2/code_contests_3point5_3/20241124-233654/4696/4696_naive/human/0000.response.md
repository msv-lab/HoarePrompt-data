Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly takes input in the form of two integers n and m. It then generates the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). The program uses the factorial function to calculate the value of f. It iterates through the range (1, n+1) and generates the required permutation as per the algorithm described in the problem statement. The logic seems to be correct and there are no apparent edge cases where the program fails to produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
