According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are given: `a` is an integer, `b` is unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` has the value at index `d` removed, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, `k` is incremented by 1, `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f`, and `d` is assigned the floor division of `i` by `f`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `k` by 1 and update the values of `f` and `d` based on the new values of `n` and `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` has the value at index `d` removed, `f` is the factorial of `n - (k + 1)`, `k` is incremented by 1, `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f`, `k + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is assigned the floor division of `i` by `f`**
