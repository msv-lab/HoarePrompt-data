Example Answer: 
`p` is assigned a range starting from 1 up to `n` + 1, where `n` is an integer. The initial state of `a` is unchanged, `b` remains the same, and `i` is `b - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer, `b` is unchanged, `n` is an integer, `i` is `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to n (inclusive).
Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is unchanged, `n` is an integer, `i` is `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to n (inclusive)**
