Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is equal to the value of `b`, so after execution, the new value of `i` is `b - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer, `b` is unchanged, `n` is an integer, `i` is `b - 1`.
Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is unchanged, `n` is an integer, `i` is `b - 1`**
