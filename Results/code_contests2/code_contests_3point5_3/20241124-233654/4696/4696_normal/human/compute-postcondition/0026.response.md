Functionality: **The function `func` reads two inputs, `n` and `i`, and performs a series of operations based on the factorial of `n - k`, where `k` ranges from 1 to `n`. It calculates `d` as the result of `i` divided by the factorial, then prints the value at index `d` of the list `p`, removes that value from `p`, and updates `i` to the remainder of `i` divided by the factorial. The loop continues until `k` reaches `n`. The function does not accept any parameters, and the final state of the variables depends on the input values and the execution of the loop.**
