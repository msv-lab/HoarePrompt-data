According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is an integer, `b` is unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` has the value at index `d` removed, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, and `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1, so it should be adjusted to `k + 1`.
- `n` should remain the same as it is unchanged.
- `i` should remain the same as it is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`.
- `p` should remain the same as it has the value at index `d` removed.
- `f` should be adjusted to the factorial of `n - (k + 1)` to prepare for the next iteration.
- `d` should be adjusted to the result of `i` divided by `f` for the next iteration.

State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` has the value at index `d` removed, `f` is the factorial of `n - (k + 1)`, and `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f`, `k` is incremented by 1**
