Example Answer:
The code snippet reads two inputs separated by a space and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: two inputs have been read and stored in variables `a` and `b`.
Output State: **two inputs have been read and stored in variables `a` and `b`**
