Example Answer:
The value of `i` is assigned the integer value of `b`. The states of `a` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer, `b` is unchanged, `n` is an integer, `i` is an integer value of `b`.
Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is unchanged, `n` is an integer, `i` is an integer value of `b`**
