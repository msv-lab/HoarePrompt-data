Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). It follows the problem description by calculating the factorial of `n-k`, finding the value of `d`, printing the value at index `d` of the list `p`, removing that value from `p`, and updating `i` to the remainder of `i` divided by the factorial. The loop continues until `k` reaches `n`. The code handles all possible cases and provides the correct output based on the problem description. The output hints also agree with the code and provide a summary of the operations performed by the code.
