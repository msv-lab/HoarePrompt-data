Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input values for n and m, calculates the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n with the maximum possible sum according to the given formula. The program iterates through the range of 1 to n, calculates the factorial, determines the index to remove from the permutation list, and removes the element at that index. The program then prints the required permutation. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases within the given constraints.
