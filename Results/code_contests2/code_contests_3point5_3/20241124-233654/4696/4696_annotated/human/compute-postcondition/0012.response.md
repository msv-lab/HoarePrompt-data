Example Answer:
The value of `f` is calculated by taking the factorial of `n - k`, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is 2. Therefore, `f` is assigned the value of the factorial of `n - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are input strings splitted, i is an integer, p contains a range of numbers from 1 to n excluding the element at index d, k is 2, f is the factorial of (n - 2), and d is 0**
