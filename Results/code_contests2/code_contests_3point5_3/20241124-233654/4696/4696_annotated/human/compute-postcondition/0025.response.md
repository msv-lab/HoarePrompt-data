The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for calculating and returning the maximum possible value of f(p) for permutations of length n, where n is the total number of elements in the permutation and m is the maximum possible value of f(p) within the permutations. The function ensures that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return the maximum possible value of f(p) for permutations of length n with the constraint that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn.
