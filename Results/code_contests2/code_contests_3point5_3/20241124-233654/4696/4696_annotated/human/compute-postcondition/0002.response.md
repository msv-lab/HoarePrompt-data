Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the integer value of `b`, where `b` is a string input that is converted to an integer. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; a and b are input strings splitted, i is an integer.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; a and b are input strings splitted, i is an integer**
