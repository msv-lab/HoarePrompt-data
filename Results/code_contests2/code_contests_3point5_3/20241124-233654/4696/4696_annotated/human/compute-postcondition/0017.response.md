According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is n, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than n. Additionally, no other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **Output State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are input strings splitted, i is an integer, k is 1, f is the factorial of (n - 2), and d is assigned the value of i divided by f. The element at index d of the list p is removed. i is assigned the remainder of i divided by f.**
