According to the code, the loop will execute for values of k ranging from 1 to n (inclusive). Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are input strings splitted, i is an integer decreased by 1, p contains a range of numbers from 1 to n, k is 1**
