Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is divided by `f` which is 24. Since `i` is decreased by 1, the result of the division `d` will be 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are input strings splitted, i is an integer decreased by 1, p contains a range of numbers from 1 to n, k is 1, f is 24, and d is 0.
