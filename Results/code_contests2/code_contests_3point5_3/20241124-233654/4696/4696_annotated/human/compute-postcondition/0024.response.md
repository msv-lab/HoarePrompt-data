Output State: **After the loop executes, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are input strings splitted, i is an integer, k is an integer between 1 and n, f is the factorial of (n - k), d is assigned the value of i divided by f. The element at index d of the list p is removed. i is assigned the remainder of i divided by f. The loop will not execute if n is less than 1 or m is greater than cntn.**
