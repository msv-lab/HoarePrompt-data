Example Answer:
The range of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) is assigned to p. The value of n is unknown, but it is given that n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; a and b are input strings splitted, i is an integer decreased by 1; p contains a range of numbers from 1 to n.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; a and b are input strings splitted, i is an integer decreased by 1; p contains a range of numbers from 1 to n**
