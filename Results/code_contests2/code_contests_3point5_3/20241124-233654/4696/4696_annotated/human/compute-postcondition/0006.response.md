Example Answer:
The variable `f` is assigned the value of the factorial of (n - k). Assuming n is 5 and k is 1, then n - k would be 4. The factorial of 4 is 24. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are input strings splitted, i is an integer decreased by 1, p contains a range of numbers from 1 to n, k is 1, and f is 24.
Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are input strings splitted, i is an integer decreased by 1, p contains a range of numbers from 1 to n, k is 1, and f is 24**
