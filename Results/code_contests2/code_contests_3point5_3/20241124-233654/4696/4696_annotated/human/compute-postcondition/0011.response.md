According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are input strings splitted, i is an integer, p contains a range of numbers from 1 to n excluding the element at index d, k is 1, f is 24, and d is 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are input strings splitted, i is an integer, p contains a range of numbers from 1 to n excluding the element at index d, k is 2, f is 24, and d is 0**
