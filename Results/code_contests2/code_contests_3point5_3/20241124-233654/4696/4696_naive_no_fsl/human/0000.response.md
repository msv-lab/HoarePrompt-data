Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers as input, n and m, representing the length of the permutation and the lexicographically m-th permutation to find. It then generates the permutation based on the given constraints and outputs the result.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically m-th permutation with the maximum possible value of f(p) for a given length n. It uses the factorial function to calculate the index of the element to select from the permutation at each step, ensuring that the maximum possible value is achieved.

The program iterates through the elements in lexicographical order and constructs the permutation accordingly. The removal of elements ensures that each element is used only once in the permutation.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly generates the required permutation for the given input.
