Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input for the city and flatland ring coordinates and radii.
- It calculates the distance between the two cities using the `func_1` function.
- It then calculates the minimum detection radius based on the distance between the cities and the radii of the city and flatland ring.
- The program outputs the minimum detection radius with 6 decimal places as required.
- The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases where the radar needs to be placed to detect the enemy's movement.
