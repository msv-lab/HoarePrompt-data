Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program defines a function that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points given their coordinates. This function is essential for the problem described, as determining the minimum detection radius of the radar involves calculating distances between points. The function itself is correct and matches the requirements of the problem description. Additionally, the function does not have any logical errors or edge cases that are not handled, so the program is correct for all potential cases.
