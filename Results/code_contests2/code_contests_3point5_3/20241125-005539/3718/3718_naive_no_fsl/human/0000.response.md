Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum detection radius for the radar based on the given input of the city and flatland ring coordinates. It calculates the distance between the two circles, and then based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description, it determines the minimum radius required for the radar. The output is formatted to display the minimum detection radius with the required precision. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
