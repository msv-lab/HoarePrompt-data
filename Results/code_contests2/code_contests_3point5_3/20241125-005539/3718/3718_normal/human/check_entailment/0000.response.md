Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the minimum detection radius for the radar based on the input of two cities and the flatland ring surrounding them. It calculates the Euclidean distance between the two cities using the `func_1` function, and then determines the minimum radius based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The output is formatted correctly to display the result with 6 decimal points. Additionally, the code handles the scenario where the cities are at the same location by checking if the distance between them is zero, which prevents division by zero error. Overall, the code meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints do not provide any cases that are not handled by the code.
