Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters representing two points' coordinates, calculates the Euclidean distance between these two points using the distance formula, and returns the result. The code does not handle any edge cases such as checking if the input parameters are valid integers or if the points are the same, which could result in a division by zero error.**
