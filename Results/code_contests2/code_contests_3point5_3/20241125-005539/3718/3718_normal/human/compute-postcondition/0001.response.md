The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `x1, y1, x2, y2`, which are integers such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| â‰¤ 104. After executing the function body, the program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two points, and return the Euclidean distance between these two points. 
Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters representing two points' coordinates and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points.**
