Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of boxes required to put all the nuts in the boxes while adhering to the constraints specified in the problem description. It iterates over the nuts and divisors, calculating the number of boxes needed based on the conditions provided. The logic implemented in the program ensures that the boxes are filled optimally without violating the given constraints. The program handles different scenarios where divisors and nuts are distributed among the boxes correctly, resulting in the minimum number of boxes used.
