Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges based on user input, `res` is 2. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is updated by subtracting `k * v` and `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)`. If `b` is greater than 0 but not greater than `k`, `a` is updated by subtracting `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is not greater than 0, `a` is updated by subtracting `v` only. In all cases, the values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are maintained within the specified ranges after the execution of the if else block.***
