Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers within the specified ranges based on user input, `res` is 2. If `b` is greater than 0, `a` is updated by subtracting `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is not greater than 0, `a` is updated by subtracting `v` only. In either case, the values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are maintained within the specified ranges after the execution of the if else block.***
