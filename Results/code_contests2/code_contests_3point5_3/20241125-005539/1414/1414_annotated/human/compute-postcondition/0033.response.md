Output State: **If `a` is greater than 0, then `res` is the number of times the loop executed. Depending on the values of `b` and `k`, the following updates occur:
- If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v` and `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`.
- If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0.
- If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is updated to `a - v`.
- If `a` is initially less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `res` remains 0.**
