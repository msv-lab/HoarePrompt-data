Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges based on user input, `res` is 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to the result of `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `v` remains unchanged. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is assigned the value 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`.***
