Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges based on user input, `res` is 1, and `b` is less than `k`. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is assigned the value 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`.***
