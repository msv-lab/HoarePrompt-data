Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges based on user input; `res` is 3. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v` and `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is updated to `a - v`.***
