Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `a - v`, where `a` and `v` are integers within the specified ranges based on user input. The value of `a` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges based on user input, `res` is 3.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges based on user input, `res` is 3**
