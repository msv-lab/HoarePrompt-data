Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for maximum sections in the box, number of nuts, number of divisors, and capacity of each section of the box.
2. The program then iterates through a loop to distribute the nuts into boxes while minimizing the number of boxes used.
3. The program ensures that each box does not have more than `k` sections and does not have more than `v` nuts in a single section.
4. The program accurately calculates the minimum number of boxes required to distribute all the nuts.
5. The program outputs the correct answer based on the problem description.

Overall, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output.
