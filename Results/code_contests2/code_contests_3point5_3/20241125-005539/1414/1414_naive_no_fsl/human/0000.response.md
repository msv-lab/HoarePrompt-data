Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for k, a, b, and v.
2. It then iterates through a while loop to distribute the nuts into boxes while minimizing the number of boxes used.
3. The program follows the rules of not dividing a box into more than k sections and not putting more than v nuts into a section.
4. The output is the minimum number of boxes required to put all the nuts, which is the expected output based on the problem description.
5. The implementation covers all possible scenarios and edge cases as per the problem requirements.
