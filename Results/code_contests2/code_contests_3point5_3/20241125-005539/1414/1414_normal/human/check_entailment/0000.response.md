Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of boxes needed to store all the nuts while considering the constraints of maximum number of sections per box and maximum number of nuts per section. The code iterates over the number of nuts and updates the values of nuts and divisors based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The final result is printed as the minimum number of boxes required. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem requirements, making it correct for all cases.
