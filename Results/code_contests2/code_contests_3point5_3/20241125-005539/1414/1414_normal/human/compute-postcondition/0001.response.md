Example Answer: 
The variable `res` is assigned the value of `0`, so after execution, `res` is `0`. The states of the other variables (`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is `0`.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is `0`**
