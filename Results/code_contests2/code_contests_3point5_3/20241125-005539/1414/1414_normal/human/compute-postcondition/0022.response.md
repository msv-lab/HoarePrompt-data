Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is 2. If b is greater than or equal to k, then a is updated by subtracting k * v and b is updated by subtracting (k - 1). If b is greater than 0 but less than k, then a is updated to a - (b + 1) * v and b is set to 0. If b is less than or equal to 0, then a is updated to a - v.***
