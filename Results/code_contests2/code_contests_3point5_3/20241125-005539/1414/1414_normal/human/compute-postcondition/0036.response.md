Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for k, a, b, and v, then iterates based on the values of a, b, and k. It updates the values of a and b according to certain conditions within the loop. The function prints the final value of res, which represents the number of iterations where a is greater than 0. If a becomes less than or equal to 0 during the loop, res is set to 0. The function does not accept any parameters and solely relies on user input for calculations.**
