Example Answer: 
The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `k - 1`. The previous value of `b` is unknown, and `k` is within the specified range, so the new value of `b` is also within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is 3.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is 3**
