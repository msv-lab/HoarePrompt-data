Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is 1.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is 1**
