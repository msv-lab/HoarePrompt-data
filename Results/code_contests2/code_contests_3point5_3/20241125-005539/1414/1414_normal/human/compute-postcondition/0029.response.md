Example Answer: 
The value of `a` is decremented by `v`, and the previous value of `a` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is 3, `a` is decremented by `v`.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is 3, `a` is decremented by `v`**
