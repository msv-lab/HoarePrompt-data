Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `res` is 1. After execution, `res` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is 2.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is 2**
