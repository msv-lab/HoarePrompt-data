Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed in the permutation p and sequence b for every skewer to visit each of the 2n placements. The program only considers the number of connected components formed by the permutation p and does not take into account the sequence b which determines if the skewer needs to be reversed.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2 1 3
1 0 1
```
The correct output should be 1, as changing the permutation to 2, 1, 3 and flipping the second skewer would ensure that every skewer visits each of the 2n placements. However, the given program would output 0 as it only checks the number of connected components and the sum of sequence b to determine the total number of elements that need to be changed.
