Postcondition: ***Each element of the list `comps` is initialized to 0. If `comps[i]` is initially 0, then after the loop executes, each element of `comps` is assigned the value of `col`, where `col` remains 1. The variables `i` and `n` retain their initial values, and `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`. If the initial value of `p[0]` is 0, the loop will not start as `comps[p[j]]` will not be 0.***
