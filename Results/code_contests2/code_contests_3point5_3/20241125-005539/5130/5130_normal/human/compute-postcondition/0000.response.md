Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is already defined as an integer in the preconditions, the value of `n` remains the same as the input value. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. `p` is a list of integers where each element is an integer between 1 and n. `b` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1.**
