Example Answer: 
`col` is assigned the value 0. The values of the elements in the list `comps` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: Each element of the list `comps` is initialized to 0, `col` is 0.
Output State: **Each element of the list `comps` is initialized to 0, `col` is 0**
