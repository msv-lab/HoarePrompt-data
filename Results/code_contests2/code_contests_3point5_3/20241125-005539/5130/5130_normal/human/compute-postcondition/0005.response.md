According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, each element of the list `comps` is initialized to 0 and `col` is 0, which does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 to start the loop, and `comps` list still has elements initialized to 0.
State: **Each element of the list `comps` is initialized to 0, `col` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
