Output State: **If comps[p[j]] is equal to 0 after the first iteration, then each element of the list comps is initialized to 1, i is less than n, j is equal to the current value of p[j], col is incremented by 1, comps[i] is assigned the value of col, and j is updated to the value of p[j]. If comps[p[j]] is not equal to 0 after the first iteration, then the loop does not execute and the initial state remains the same.**
