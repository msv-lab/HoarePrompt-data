According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. If this condition is true, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, each element of the list `comps` is initialized to 0, `col` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the `i-th` element of `comps` is assigned the value of `col`, which is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `comps[p[j]]` to be 0.
State: **Each element of the list `comps` is initialized to 0, `col` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the `i-th` element of `comps` is assigned the value of `col`, which is 1, and `comps[p[j]]` is 0**
