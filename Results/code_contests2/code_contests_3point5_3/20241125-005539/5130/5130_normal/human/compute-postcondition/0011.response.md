Example Answer:
The `j-th` element of the list `comps` is assigned the value of `col`, where `col` is 1. The previous values of variables are as follows: Each element of the list `comps` is initialized to 0, `col` is 1, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. After executing the code, the `i-th` element of `comps` is assigned the value of `col`, which is 1.
Output State: **Each element of the list `comps` is initialized to 0, `col` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the `i-th` element of `comps` is assigned the value of `col`, which is 1**
