Postcondition: ***Each element of the list `comps` is initialized to 1, `i` is less than `n` (incremented by 1), and `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]` with necessary adjustments to `comps` and `col` as per the conditions mentioned in the loop. If comps[i] is 0, then col is increased by 1, and comps[i] is set to col. The variable j is updated to i. If comps[p[j]] is 0, j is updated to p[j] and comps[j] is set to col until comps[p[j]] is not 0. At the end of the execution, each element of comps will be updated based on the value of col.***
