Postcondition: ***Each element of the list `comps` is initialized to 1, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`. If `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0 after the first iteration, then `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`. Subsequently, while `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `j` is updated to `p[j]` and `comps[j]` is set to `col`. If `comps[p[j]]` is not equal to 0 after the first iteration, the loop does not execute and the initial state remains the same.***
