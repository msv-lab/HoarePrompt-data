Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the given problem description. The logic in the code is incomplete and does not handle all cases as required by the problem statement. 

One potential case where the code fails is when the given permutation and sequence do not enable each skewer to visit each of the 2n placements. In such cases, the code does not calculate the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to achieve the desired outcome.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
