Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is 1, p is a sequence of integers satisfying 0 <= pi <= n-1, b is a sequence of integers, comps is a list of size n where all elements are initialized to either 0 or col, and col is the count of unique non-zero elements in comps, comps[p[1]] is 0. After the execution of the if block, if there exists a cycle in the p sequence that leads back to j, then the loop will continue indefinitely updating comps with col. If there is no cycle, the loop will terminate when comps[p[j]] is not 0, and the comp list will be updated accordingly with the unique non-zero elements in comps increased by 1. The value of j will be the index in the p sequence that caused the loop to terminate.***
