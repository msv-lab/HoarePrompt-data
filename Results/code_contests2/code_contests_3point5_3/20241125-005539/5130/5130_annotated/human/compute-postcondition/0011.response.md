Output State: n is greater than 0, i is 0, p is a sequence of integers satisfying 0 <= pi <= n-1, b is a sequence of integers, comps is a list of size n with all elements initialized to 0, col is 1. The value of comps at index i is 1, j is updated to the value stored at index j in sequence p, and comps[j] is updated to col.
