According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. If this condition is true, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[j]` is equal to `col`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `comps[p[j]]` needs to be adjusted to 0.
State: **Output State: comps[j] is equal to col, comps[p[j]] is equal to 0**
