Output State: **If there exists a cycle in the p sequence that leads back to j, then the loop will continue indefinitely, updating comps with col. If there is no cycle, the loop will terminate when comps[p[j]] is not 0, and the comp list will be updated accordingly with the unique non-zero elements in comps increased by 1. The value of j will be the index in the p sequence that caused the loop to terminate.**
