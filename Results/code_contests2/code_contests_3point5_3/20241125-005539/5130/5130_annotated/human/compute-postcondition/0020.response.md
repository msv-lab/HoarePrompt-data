Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is 0, p is a sequence of integers satisfying 0 <= pi <= n-1, b is a sequence of integers, comps is a list of size n where all elements are initialized to either 0 or col, col is the count of unique non-zero elements in comps. If comps[i] is initially 0, then col is increased by 1, comps[i] is updated to col, and a sequence of operations updates the values in comps based on the values in p. If the loop executes at least once, comps[j] is updated to col where j is updated to the value stored at index j in sequence p. If comps[p[j]] is not 0, the loop will not execute, and the variables retain their initial values. This postcondition covers all possible cases, ensuring the correct state of the variables after the execution of the program fragment.***
