Example Answer:
The sequence `b` is assigned the result of mapping integers from the input split by spaces. The values in `b` are all integers. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, p is a sequence of integers where each integer pi satisfies 0 <= pi <= n-1, b is a sequence of integers.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, p is a sequence of integers where each integer pi satisfies 0 <= pi <= n-1, b is a sequence of integers**
