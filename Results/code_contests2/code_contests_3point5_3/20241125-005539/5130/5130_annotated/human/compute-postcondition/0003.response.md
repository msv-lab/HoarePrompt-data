Example Answer:
`comps` is initialized as a list of size `n` with all elements initialized to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, p is a sequence of integers where each integer pi satisfies 0 <= pi <= n-1, b is a sequence of integers, comps is a list of size n with all elements initialized to 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, p is a sequence of integers where each integer pi satisfies 0 <= pi <= n-1, b is a sequence of integers, comps is a list of size n with all elements initialized to 0**
