Example Answer:
The variable `col` is assigned the value 0. Since this assignment does not affect any other variables, the output state is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, p is a sequence of integers where each integer pi satisfies 0 <= pi <= n-1, b is a sequence of integers, comps is a list of size n with all elements initialized to 0, and col is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, p is a sequence of integers where each integer pi satisfies 0 <= pi <= n-1, b is a sequence of integers, comps is a list of size n with all elements initialized to 0, and col is 0**
