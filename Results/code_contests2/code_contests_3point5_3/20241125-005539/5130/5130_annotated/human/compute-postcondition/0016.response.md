Example Answer:
The value of `j` is updated to the value stored at index `j` in sequence `p`. Since `p` contains integers satisfying 0 <= pi <= n-1, the value of `j` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 0, i is 0, p is a sequence of integers satisfying 0 <= pi <= n-1, b is a sequence of integers, comps is a list of size n with all elements initialized to 0 except comps[j] = 1, col is 1, the value of comps at index p[j] is 0, j is updated to the value stored at index j in sequence p.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, p is a sequence of integers satisfying 0 <= pi <= n-1, b is a sequence of integers, comps is a list of size n with all elements initialized to 0 except comps[j] = 1, col is 1, the value of comps at index p[j] is 0, j is updated to the value stored at index j in sequence p**
