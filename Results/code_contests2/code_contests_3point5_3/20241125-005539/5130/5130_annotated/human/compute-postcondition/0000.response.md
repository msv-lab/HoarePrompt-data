Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` can be any integer between 1 and 2*10^5. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5. p is a sequence of integers where each integer pi satisfies 1 <= pi <= n. b is a sequence of zeros and ones.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5. p is a sequence of integers where each integer pi satisfies 1 <= pi <= n. b is a sequence of zeros and ones.**
