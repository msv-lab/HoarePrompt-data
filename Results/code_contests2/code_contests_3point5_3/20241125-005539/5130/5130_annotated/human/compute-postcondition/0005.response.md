According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than 0. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: n is greater than 0, i is 0, p is a sequence of integers satisfying 0 <= pi <= n-1, b is a sequence of integers, comps is a list of size n with all elements initialized to 0, and col is 0.
State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, p is a sequence of integers satisfying 0 <= pi <= n-1, b is a sequence of integers, comps is a list of size n with all elements initialized to 0, col is 0**
