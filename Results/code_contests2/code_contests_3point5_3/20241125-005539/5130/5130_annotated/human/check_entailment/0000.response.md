Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed in the given permutation p and sequence b so that every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements. 

The code only considers changing elements in the permutation p if col is not equal to 1 and changing elements in the sequence b if the sum of b is equal to 0. However, this approach does not cover all possible cases and does not ensure that every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements.

To determine the correctness of the code, we need to check for cases where the program may not work as expected based on the problem description.
