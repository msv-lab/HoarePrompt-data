Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the feature of Beroffice editor as described in the problem statement. The program does not insert spaces to separate the consecutive blocks of consonants correctly. It also does not handle the case when there are multiple solutions to insert spaces. The program only inserts spaces between the first two consecutive consonants and then continues without inserting spaces where required.

hel lo
```

hel lo
```
