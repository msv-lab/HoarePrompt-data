Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function should identify words with typos, which are defined as having a block of at least three consonants in a row with at least two different letters. The code seems to be trying to insert spaces between consonants, but it does so incorrectly. For example, in the word "hellno", the code would output "hel lno" which is incorrect.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where a block of consonants has all letters the same and is longer than three letters. For example, in the word "backtothefutttture", the code would still consider it a typo, while according to the problem description, it should not be. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect based on the problem description.
