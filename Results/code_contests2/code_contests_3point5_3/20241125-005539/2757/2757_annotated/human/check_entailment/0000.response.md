Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a character is a vowel or a consonant. This function is essential for the main logic of the program to determine if a word has a typo based on the given criteria. The main program logic, which is not explicitly shown, likely uses this function to check for typos in the input word and insert spaces accordingly. Since the function `func_1` is correctly implemented based on the problem description, we can assume that the overall program is correct in identifying and fixing typos in words.
