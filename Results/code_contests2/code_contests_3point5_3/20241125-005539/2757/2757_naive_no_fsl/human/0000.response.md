Correctness: False

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description. It only checks for consecutive consonants of length 3 and does not handle cases where there are more than 3 consecutive consonants. Additionally, the program does not consider the exception where all the consecutive consonants are the same letter. 

For example, for the input "backtothefutttture", the program does not correctly handle the consecutive consonants "ttt" as the same letter and should not insert spaces between them.
