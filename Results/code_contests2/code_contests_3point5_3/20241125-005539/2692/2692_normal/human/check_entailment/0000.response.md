Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads an even integer `n` and a list of `n/2` integer values as a ticket number input. It then calculates the sum of the first half of the ticket number and the sum of the second half. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, which states that a ticket is lucky if it is a lucky number and the sum of digits in the first half equals the sum of digits in the second half. The code correctly handles all cases within the specified constraints.
