Postcondition: ***n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. The input ticket number is a positive integer of length n. The list `digits` contains n/2 integer values. If the sum of the first half of `digits` is equal to the sum of the second half of `digits`, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program correctly handles all scenarios where n is an even integer between 2 and 50, ensuring that the sums of the two halves of `digits` are compared and the appropriate message is printed accordingly.***
