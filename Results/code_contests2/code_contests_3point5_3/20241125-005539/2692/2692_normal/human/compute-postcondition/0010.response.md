Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an even integer `n` between 2 and 50 and a list of `n/2` integer values as a ticket number input. If the sum of the first half of the ticket number is equal to the sum of the second half, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function correctly handles cases where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 50, ensuring comparison of sums of two halves of the ticket number for equality.**
