Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input().strip()` reads a line from input, removes leading and trailing whitespaces, and converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is an even integer between 2 and 50. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
Output State: **n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50**
