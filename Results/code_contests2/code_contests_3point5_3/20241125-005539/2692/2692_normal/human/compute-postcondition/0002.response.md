Example Answer: 
`digits` is assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers using `map(int, raw_input().strip())`. The input values are not specified, but since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 50, the number of digits in the input will be equal to `n/2`. Therefore, the output state is: n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `digits` contains n/2 integer values.
Output State: **n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `digits` contains n/2 integer values**
