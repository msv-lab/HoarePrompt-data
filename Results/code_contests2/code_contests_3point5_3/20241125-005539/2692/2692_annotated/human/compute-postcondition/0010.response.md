Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an even integer `n` between 2 and 50 and a list of integers `digits` representing individual digits of a ticket number. The function compares the sums of the first and second halves of the digits. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function ensures correct output based on the comparison of digit sums.**
