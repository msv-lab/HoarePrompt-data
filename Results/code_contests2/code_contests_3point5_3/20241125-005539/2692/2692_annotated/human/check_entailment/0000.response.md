Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where the ticket number is a lucky number. The program only checks if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half, but it does not check if the ticket number is a lucky number. Therefore, the program can output 'YES' for a ticket number that is not a lucky number.
