Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem description states that the input coordinates are given as arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c, but the program is trying to read floating-point numbers directly, which is not the expected input format.

The program should be modified to correctly parse and evaluate the arithmetic expressions provided in the input. Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, it is incorrect.
