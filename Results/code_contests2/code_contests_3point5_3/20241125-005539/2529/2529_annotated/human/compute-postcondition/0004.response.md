Example Answer: 
The value of `e` is appended to the `test_list`. Since `test_list` was empty, it now contains `e`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `e`, `i` is 0, and `e` is an input floating-point number.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `e`, `i` is 0, `e` is an input floating-point number**
