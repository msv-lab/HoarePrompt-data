According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `test_list` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `my_list` contains the updated count of `i` occurrences in `test_list` plus 1. To execute the loop one more time, the `test_list` should still have elements to iterate over and the count of `i` occurrences should increase by 1.
State: **`my_list` contains the updated count of `i` occurrences in `test_list` plus 2**
