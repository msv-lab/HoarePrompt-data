According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. If `test_list` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `my_list` is empty, it needs to be adjusted so that `test_list` has at least 1 element for the loop to execute.
State: **`my_list` is an empty list, `test_list` has at least 1 element**
