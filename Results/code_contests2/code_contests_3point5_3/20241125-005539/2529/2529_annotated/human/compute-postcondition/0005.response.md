According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `e`, `i` is 0, `e` is an input floating-point number. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `e`, `i` is 1, `e` is an input floating-point number**
