The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function processes a list of m ships, where m is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000. Each ship's jump coordinate is given as an arithmetic expression of the form (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers with up to two decimal digits. The function does not return any value, it simply processes the ship coordinates.
