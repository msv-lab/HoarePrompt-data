Example Answer: 
The count of `i` occurrences in `test_list` is calculated and then incremented by 1, and the result is appended to `my_list`. The values of the variables before execution are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `my_list` contains the count of `i` occurrences in `test_list` plus 1.
Output State: **`my_list` contains the count of `i` occurrences in `test_list` plus 1**
