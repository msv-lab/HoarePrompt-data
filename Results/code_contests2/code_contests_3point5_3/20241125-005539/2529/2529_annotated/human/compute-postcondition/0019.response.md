Example Answer:
The `count` method is used to count the occurrences of `i` in `test_list`, and the result is appended to `my_list`. The initial state mentions that `my_list` contains the count of `i` occurrences in the updated `test_list` plus 1, so after this operation, the new count of `i` occurrences in the updated `test_list` is appended to `my_list` along with the extra 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `my_list` contains the updated count of `i` occurrences in `test_list` plus 1.
Output State: **`my_list` contains the updated count of `i` occurrences in `test_list` plus 1**
