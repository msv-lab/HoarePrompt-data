According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `m`. If `m` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Initially, `test_list` is empty, so for the loop to start executing, `m` needs to be greater than 0 and `i` needs to be 0.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` is empty, `i` is 0**
