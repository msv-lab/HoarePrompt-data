Example Answer: 
The value `e` is appended to the `test_list`, which already contains two occurrences of `e`. Therefore, after execution, `test_list` will have three occurrences of `e`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains three occurrences of `e`, `i` is 2, `e` is the input floating-point number**
