Example Answer: 
The value of `e` is appended to the `test_list`. Since `test_list` already contains `e`, after execution, `test_list` will have two occurrences of `e`. The value of `i` remains 1 and `m` remains greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains two occurrences of `e`, `i` is 1, `e` is an input floating-point number.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains two occurrences of `e`, `i` is 1, `e` is an input floating-point number**
