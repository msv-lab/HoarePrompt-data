According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `test_list`. If `i` is an element in `test_list`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `my_list` contains the count of `i` occurrences in `test_list`. To execute one more time, there needs to be at least one more occurrence of `i` in `test_list`. Therefore, the count of `i` occurrences in `my_list` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`my_list` contains the count of `i` occurrences in `test_list` plus 1**
