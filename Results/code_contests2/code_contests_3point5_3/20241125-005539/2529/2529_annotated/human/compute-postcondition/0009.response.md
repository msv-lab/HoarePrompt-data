Example Answer:
The variable `e` is assigned the value of the floating-point number input by the user. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains two occurrences of `e`, `i` is 2, and `e` is the input floating-point number.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains two occurrences of `e`, `i` is 2, `e` is the input floating-point number**
