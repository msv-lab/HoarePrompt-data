According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains three occurrences of `e`, `i` is 2, `e` is the input floating-point number. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains three occurrences of `e`, `i` is 3, `e` is the input floating-point number**
