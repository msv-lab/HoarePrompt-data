Example Answer:
`my_list` is appended with the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`. Since `test_list` has at least 1 element, the count of `i` will be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the output state is: `my_list` contains the count of `i` occurrences in `test_list`.
Output State: **`my_list` contains the count of `i` occurrences in `test_list`**
