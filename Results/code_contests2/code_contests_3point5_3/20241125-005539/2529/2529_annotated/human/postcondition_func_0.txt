The function `func` reads an integer `m` from the user, then reads `m` floating-point numbers input by the user and stores them in a list named `test_list`. It then iterates through `test_list` to count the occurrences of each element and stores the count in a new list named `my_list`. Finally, it prints the counts of each element in `my_list` separated by spaces. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
