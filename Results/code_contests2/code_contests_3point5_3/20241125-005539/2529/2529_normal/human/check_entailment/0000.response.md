Correctness: **False**

The code does not accurately follow the problem description. The input is expected to be arithmetic expressions in the form (a+b)/c, but the code is reading float values instead, leading to incorrect results. For example, the code may not correctly handle parentheses and division. The output hints do not agree with the code as they describe a different input format and functionality. Therefore, the code needs to be revised to correctly process arithmetic expressions as input.
