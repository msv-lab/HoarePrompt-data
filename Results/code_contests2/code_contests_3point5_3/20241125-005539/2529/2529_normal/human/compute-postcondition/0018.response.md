According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `test_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `my_list` contains the count of `i` in `test_list` with one more element processed. This means that the loop has already processed one element, so the count in `my_list` needs to be adjusted accordingly for the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`my_list` contains the count of `i` in `test_list` with one more element processed.**
