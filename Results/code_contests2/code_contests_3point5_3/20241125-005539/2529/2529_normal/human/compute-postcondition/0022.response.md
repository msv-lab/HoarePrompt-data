Example Answer:
The code prints the elements of my_list separated by spaces after converting them to strings. If test_list is empty, my_list remains an empty list. Therefore, the output state is: my_list contains the count of each element in test_list, with each element processed once. If test_list is empty, my_list remains an empty list.
Output State: **my_list contains the count of each element in test_list, with each element processed once. If test_list is empty, my_list remains an empty list**
