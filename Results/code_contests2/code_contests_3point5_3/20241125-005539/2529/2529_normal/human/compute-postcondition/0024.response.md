Functionality: **The function `func` allows the user to input a specified number of float values representing ships. It then counts the occurrences of each input value and prints the count of each value in the order of appearance. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value. If no input is provided, the function will not execute the loops and the output will be empty.**
