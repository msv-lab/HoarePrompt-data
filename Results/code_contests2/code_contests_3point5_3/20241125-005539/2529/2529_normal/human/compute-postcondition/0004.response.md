Example Answer: 
A float value `e` input by the user is added to the `test_list`. Since `test_list` was initially empty, it now contains the float value `e`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `test_list` contains the float value input by the user, `e` is a float**
