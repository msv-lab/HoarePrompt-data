According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_list. If test_list is not empty, the loop can execute. Since my_list is an empty list, it does not impact the loop execution directly. To ensure the loop executes, test_list must have at least 1 element. 
State: **`my_list` is an empty list, `test_list` has at least 1 element**
