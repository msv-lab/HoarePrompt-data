According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `m` is a non-negative integer. Before the loop starts, the `test_list` is empty and `m` represents the number of ships. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `m` must be a non-negative integer. 
State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `test_list` is empty**
