Example Answer:
The value of `e` is assigned the float value input by the user. The variable `m` is a non-negative integer and `test_list` is empty. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is a non-negative integer, `test_list` is empty, `e` is a float input by the user.
Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `test_list` is empty, `e` is a float input by the user**
