Output State: 
The loop allows the user to input float values `m` times, where `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of ships. After the loop executes, `m` will be equal to the number of ships, `test_list` will contain all the float values input by the user, and `e` will hold the last float value input. If `m` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `test_list` will remain empty, `e` will not be assigned any value.
