Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program reads input values as float, while the input values are arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c. The program should parse the arithmetic expressions and evaluate them to get the coordinate values. Additionally, the program is counting the occurrences of the values instead of counting the number of ships at the same coordinate. 

Therefore, the program needs to be corrected to correctly parse the arithmetic expressions and count the number of ships at the same coordinate to match the problem description.
