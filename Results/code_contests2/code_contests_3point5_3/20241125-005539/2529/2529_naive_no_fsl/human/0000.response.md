Correctness: **False**

The given program does not match the problem description. The input is expected to be in the form of (a+b)/c, but the program is trying to read the input as float values, which will not work as intended. Also, it is not counting the number of ships with the same coordinates correctly. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
