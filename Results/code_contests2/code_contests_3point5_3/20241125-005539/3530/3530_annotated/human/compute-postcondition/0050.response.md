Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD` and `j` is incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo MOD. All other elements in `dp` remain unchanged.***
