According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0, as `n` determines the range of the loop. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD` does not directly affect the loop execution, so it doesn't need to be adjusted specifically for the loop to execute. However, `mask` is mentioned in the loop statement as `range(n)`, so it needs to be adjusted as well. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0**
