Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`. `n` is greater than 1. `i` is incremented by 1. `j` is the next value where `a[i][j]` is equal to 1, and the necessary adjustments for `dp[i][mask]` update are made. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulus with `MOD`. This postcondition holds true for all possible edge cases and scenarios of the given program fragment.***
