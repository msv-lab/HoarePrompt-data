Postcondition: ***dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 1, j is 0. If a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set, then dp[i][mask] is increased by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and subjected to the operation dp[i][mask] %= MOD for all elements.***
