Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of the current value of `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`. The values of `n`, `mask`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with updated elements, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n), and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n+1.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with updated elements, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n), and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n+1**
