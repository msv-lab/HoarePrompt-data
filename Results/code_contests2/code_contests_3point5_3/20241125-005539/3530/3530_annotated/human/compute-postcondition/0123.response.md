According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD` at least once. 
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 1**
