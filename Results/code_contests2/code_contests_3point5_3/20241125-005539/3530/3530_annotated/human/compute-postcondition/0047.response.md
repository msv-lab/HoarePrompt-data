According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the given formula. For the next iteration, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which needs to be incremented by 1 to continue the loop.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `j` is incremented by 1**
