Output State: After the loop executes, `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`. `n` is a positive integer. If the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are met, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo MOD. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases based on the given program fragment.
