According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is greater than 0. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to 2^n (exclusive), so it will execute if n is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, all elements in the 2D list dp are set to 1 at the 0th row does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `mask` is 1.
State: **All elements in the 2D list `dp` are set to 1 at the 0th row, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1**
