Based on the given code snippet and the condition for the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

Since the loop iterates over the range (1, 1 << n), the loop will execute again if the current value of `mask` is less than 1 << n. Therefore, `mask` needs to be adjusted to be less than 1 << n.

State: **After the loop executes, `dp` is a 2D list with updated elements, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is less than 1 << n, and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n**.
