Output State: `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` after applying the operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` to all elements.
