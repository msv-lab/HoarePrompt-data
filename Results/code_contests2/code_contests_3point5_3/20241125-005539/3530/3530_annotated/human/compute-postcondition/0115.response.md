Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp`, `n`, `mask`, and `j` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a 2D list with updated elements, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n), and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n+1.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with updated elements, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n), and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n+1**
