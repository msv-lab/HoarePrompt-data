According to the code, the loop can execute if the `mask` variable is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `n`, `mask`, and `j` have the following values: `dp` is a 2D list updated according to the formula, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the `mask` variable needs to be incremented by 1. All other states remain the same.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 2, `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`**
