According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list where elements are updated, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 2, and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`. Since `mask` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be incremented to the next value within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where elements are updated, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n), `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`**
