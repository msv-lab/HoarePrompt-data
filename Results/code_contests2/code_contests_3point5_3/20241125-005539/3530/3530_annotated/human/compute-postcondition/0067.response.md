According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to `j` is 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `a` is a 2D list**
