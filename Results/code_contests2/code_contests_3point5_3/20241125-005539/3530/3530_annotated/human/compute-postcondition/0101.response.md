Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND operation with 1 shifted left by `j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. The state of the program variables following the execution of the if statement reflects the modification of elements in `dp` based on the conditions specified, ensuring the integrity of the initial values and relationships among the variables.***
