Functionality: **The function `func` reads an input integer `n` and a list of lists `a` containing binary values. It creates a dynamic programming table `dp` and calculates values based on bitwise operations and conditions. Finally, it prints the value at a specific index in the `dp` table. The function does not return any value. This implementation relies heavily on bitwise operations and dynamic programming to compute values efficiently.**
