Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`. `mask` ranges from 1 to 1 << n + 1, where `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios of updating `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions provided in the program fragment.***
