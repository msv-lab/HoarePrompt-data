Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Since `mask` has the bit at position `j+1` set to 1, `mask ^ 1 << j` will toggle the bit at position `j+1` from 1 to 0. Therefore, the value added to `dp[i][mask]` is `dp[i - 1][mask with the j+1 bit toggled]`. The output state is: `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `mask` has the bit at position `j+1` set to 1, `j` is 2, and the values in `dp` have been updated accordingly.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `mask` has the bit at position `j+1` set to 1, `j` is 2, and the values in `dp` have been updated accordingly**
