According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of 0 to `n-1`. It's already given that `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, so the loop will execute. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where elements are updated, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n), `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`**
