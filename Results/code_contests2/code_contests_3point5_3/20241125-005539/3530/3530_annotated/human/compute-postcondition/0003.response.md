According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, so it ensures that the loop will execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer and the list `a` remains empty.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list**
