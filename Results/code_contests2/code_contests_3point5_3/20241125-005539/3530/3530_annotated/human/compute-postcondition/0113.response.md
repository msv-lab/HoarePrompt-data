Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with updated elements, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n), and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`. If the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is satisfied, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the result modulo MOD. Ensure that all elements and conditions are maintained in the postcondition, covering all possible cases and edge cases.***
