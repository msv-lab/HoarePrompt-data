Example Answer:
The list `a` appends the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which converts inputs to integers. The previous values are `n` as a positive integer and `a` as an empty list. After execution, the list `a` will contain the mapped integers from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains the mapped integers from the input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains the mapped integers from the input**
