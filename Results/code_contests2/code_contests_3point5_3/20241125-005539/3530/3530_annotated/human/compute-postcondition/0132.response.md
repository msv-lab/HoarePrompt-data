Postcondition: ***dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 0, j is 0. If a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and the bitwise AND between mask and 1 left-shifted by j is true, then dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 left-shifted by j] and the result is taken modulo MOD. This condition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases after the execution of the if else block.***
