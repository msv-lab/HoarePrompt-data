Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with updated elements, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n), and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n+1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking modulo MOD. This operation covers all possible edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the execution of the if else block.***
