According to the code, the loop executes as long as `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated as described. To execute the loop one more time, the `mask` value needs to be adjusted. Since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `1 << n`, the next `mask` value should be incremented to continue the loop. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n + 1`**
