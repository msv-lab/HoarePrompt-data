Example Answer:
The values from the input are mapped to integers and appended to the list `a`. The previous state of `n` is not relevant in this case. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer + 1, `a` contains the mapped integers from the input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer + 1, `a` contains the mapped integers from the input**
