Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 0. If the element at index `i-1` in the `j`th column of `a` is 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. This update occurs for all possible combinations of `i`, `mask`, and `j` that satisfy the conditions.***
