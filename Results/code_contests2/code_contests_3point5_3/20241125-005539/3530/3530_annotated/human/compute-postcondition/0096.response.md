Example Answer:
The value at index `i` and `mask` in the 2D list `dp` is updated to be the remainder of the current value divided by `MOD`. The variables `n` and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1**
