According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0 since the range function requires a positive number. Also, `j` is the iterator variable that will go through the range of `n`. Before the loop starts, the `dp` 2D list must be properly initialized according to the formula, `mask` must be 2, and `j` should be set to 0 to start the loop.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0**
