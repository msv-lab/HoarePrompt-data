Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD. The previous states of dp[i][mask], dp[i - 1][mask], and j are not provided, so the output state is: dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 0, j is 0.
Output State: **dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 0, j is 0**
