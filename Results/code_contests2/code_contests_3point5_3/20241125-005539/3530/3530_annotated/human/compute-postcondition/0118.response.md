According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n+1`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with updated elements, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n), and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`**
