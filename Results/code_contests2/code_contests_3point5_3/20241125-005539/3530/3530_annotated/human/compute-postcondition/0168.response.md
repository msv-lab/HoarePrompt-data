Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`. `n` is greater than 1. After the execution of the if statement, if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit in `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and finally taken modulo `MOD`. This process ensures that the elements in `dp` are properly updated based on the conditions specified, handling all possible edge cases involving the values of `i`, `j`, and `mask`***
