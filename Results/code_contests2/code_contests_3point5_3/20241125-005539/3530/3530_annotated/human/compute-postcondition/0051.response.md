According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the provided formula and `j` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD` and `j` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `n`**
