Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of its current value with `MOD`. The previous values of `dp`, `n`, `mask`, and `j` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list where elements are updated, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n), and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where elements are updated, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n), and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`**
