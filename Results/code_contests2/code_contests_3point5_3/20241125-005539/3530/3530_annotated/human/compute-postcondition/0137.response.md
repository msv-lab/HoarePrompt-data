According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1 and `j` is 0. Since `n` being greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, it must be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD. n is greater than 0, j is 0**
