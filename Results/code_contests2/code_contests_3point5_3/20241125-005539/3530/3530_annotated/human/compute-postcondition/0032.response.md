Output State: All elements in the 2D list `dp` are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, where each element `dp[i][mask]` is the remainder of the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`. `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2. After the execution of the code `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, the elements in the 2D list `dp` are further updated based on the addition of the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to `dp[i][mask]` and taking the remainder of the result divided by `MOD`.
