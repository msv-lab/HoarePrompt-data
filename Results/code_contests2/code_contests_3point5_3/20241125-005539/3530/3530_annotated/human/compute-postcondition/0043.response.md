According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list updated according to the given formula, `mask` ranges from 1 to 1 << n + 1, and `n` is greater than 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `mask` ranges from 1 to 1 << n + 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1**
