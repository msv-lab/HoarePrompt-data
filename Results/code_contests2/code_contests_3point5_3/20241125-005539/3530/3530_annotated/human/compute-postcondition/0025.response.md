Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of dividing the current value of `dp[i][mask]` by `MOD`. Since the initial state is not provided for the values of `i` and `MOD`, the output state will be: All elements in the 2D list `dp` are set to 1 at the 0th row, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0. The element at index (i-1, j) in the 2D list `a` is 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is also 1.
Output State: **All elements in the 2D list `dp` are set to 1 at the 0th row, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0. The element at index (i-1, j) in the 2D list `a` is 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is also 1.**
