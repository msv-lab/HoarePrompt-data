Example Answer: 
The code snippet appends the mapped integers from the input to the list `a`. The previous state of `n` is a positive integer + 2. After execution, the integers from the input are added to the list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer + 2, `a` contains the mapped integers from the input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer + 2, `a` contains the mapped integers from the input**
