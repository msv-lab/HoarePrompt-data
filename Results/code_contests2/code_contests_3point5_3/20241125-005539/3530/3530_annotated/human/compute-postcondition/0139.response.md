According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mask` and the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j. If this condition is met, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 1, j is 0. As the condition for the loop to execute is based on a[i - 1][j] being equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are: i should be updated to i + 1, and j should be updated to the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1.
State: **dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 1, i is incremented by 1, j is the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1**
