According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is a non-negative integer. Before the loop starts, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where each element is initialized to 0 ensures that the loop will execute. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where each element is initialized to 0, `n` is a non-negative integer**
