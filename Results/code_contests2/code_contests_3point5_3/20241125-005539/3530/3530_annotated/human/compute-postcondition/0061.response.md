Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `a` is a 2D list.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `a` is a 2D list**
