Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the result of `dp[i][mask] % MOD`, where `MOD` is a constant value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: dp is a 2D list updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 1, i is incremented by 1, j is the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1, and dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j].
Output State: **dp is a 2D list updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 1, i is incremented by 1, j is the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1, and dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
