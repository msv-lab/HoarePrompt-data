Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The element `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and bit `j` is set in `mask`, so the calculation is based on these values. After execution, the output state will be the updated values of `dp[i][mask]` based on the formula provided.
Output State: **Updated values of `dp[i][mask]` based on the formula `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
