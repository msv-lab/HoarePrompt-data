Postcondition: ***dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD. The integer n is greater than 1, i is incremented by 1, and j is the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1. If the previous value of a[i - 1][j] is 1 and the jth bit of the mask is also set, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taking the modulo MOD. This postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the if else block.***
