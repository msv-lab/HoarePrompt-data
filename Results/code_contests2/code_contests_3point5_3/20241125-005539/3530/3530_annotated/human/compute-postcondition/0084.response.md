Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo division with `MOD`. Since all elements in `dp` have been updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, applying the modulo operation again will not change the values. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `mask` has the bit at position `j+1` set to 1, `j` is 2, and the values in `dp` have been updated accordingly.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `mask` has the bit at position `j+1` set to 1, `j` is 2, and the values in `dp` have been updated accordingly**
