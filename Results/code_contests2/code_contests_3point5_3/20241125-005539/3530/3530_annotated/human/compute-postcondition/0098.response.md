According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 2**
