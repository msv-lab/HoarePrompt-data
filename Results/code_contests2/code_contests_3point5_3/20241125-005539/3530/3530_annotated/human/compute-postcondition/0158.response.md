Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the next value where `a[i][j]` is equal to 1, and the necessary adjustments for `dp[i][mask]` update are made. The previous element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
