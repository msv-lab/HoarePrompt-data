Postcondition: ***dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD. n is greater than 1. i is incremented by 1. j is the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is increased by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taken modulo MOD. The program handles all cases where the conditions are met, ensuring the proper updating of dp according to the specified formula while accounting for potential edge cases.***
