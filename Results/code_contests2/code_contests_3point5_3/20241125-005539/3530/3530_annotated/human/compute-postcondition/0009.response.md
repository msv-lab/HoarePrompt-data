According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times based on the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer + 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is a positive integer + 3, `a` contains the mapped integers from the input**
