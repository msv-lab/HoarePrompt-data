According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than (1 << n). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to (1 << n) + 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than (1 << n), so `i` should be equal to (1 << n). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where each element is initialized to 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to (1 << n), `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1**
