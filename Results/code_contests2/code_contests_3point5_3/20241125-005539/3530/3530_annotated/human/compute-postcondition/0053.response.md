According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the given formula. The loop iterates over `mask` from 1 to `1 << n`. To execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **After the loop executes, `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`. `n` is greater than 0**
