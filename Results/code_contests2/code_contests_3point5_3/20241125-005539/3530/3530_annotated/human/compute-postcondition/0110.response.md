According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n). Since `j` is less than `n`, to execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be the next integer after the current `j`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where elements are updated. `n` is a positive integer. `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n). The next `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`**
