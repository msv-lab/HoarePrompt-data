According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is the next value where `a[i][j]` is equal to 1. To update `dp[i][mask]` based on the given conditions, the necessary adjustment should be made for `mask` to include the j-th bit. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` should be updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulus with `MOD`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the next value where `a[i][j]` is equal to 1, `mask` includes the j-th bit. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulus with `MOD`**
