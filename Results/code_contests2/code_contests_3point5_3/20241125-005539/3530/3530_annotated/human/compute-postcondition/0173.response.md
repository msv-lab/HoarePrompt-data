According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1. Since `n` being greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **After the loop executes, `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 2**
