Output State: **After the loop executes, dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD. The integer n is greater than 1, i is incremented by 1, and j is the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1. If the previous value of a[i - 1][j] is 1 and the jth bit of the mask is also set, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taking the modulo MOD. The loop will execute for all values of j in the range of n. In cases where a[i - 1][j] is not equal to 1 or the jth bit of the mask is not set, the loop will not execute, leaving dp unchanged.**
