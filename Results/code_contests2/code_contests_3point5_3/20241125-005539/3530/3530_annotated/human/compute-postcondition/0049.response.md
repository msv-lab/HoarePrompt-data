Example Answer:
The code snippet reduces the value of `dp[i][mask]` to its remainder when divided by MOD. Additionally, `j` is incremented by 1. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by incrementing it by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, `j`, and other variables are not provided, so the output state is: `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
