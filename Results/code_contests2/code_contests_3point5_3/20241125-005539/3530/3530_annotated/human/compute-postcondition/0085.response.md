Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`. `n` is greater than 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the bit at position `j+1` set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. All other elements in `dp` remain unchanged. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains the same as before. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the program execution.***
