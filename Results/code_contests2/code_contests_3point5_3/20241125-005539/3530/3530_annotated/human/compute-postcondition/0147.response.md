Example Answer:
The code snippet takes the modulo of the value stored in dp[i][mask] with MOD. This operation does not change the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 1, i is incremented by 1, j is the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1, and dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j].
Output State: **dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 1, i is incremented by 1, j is the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1, and dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
