Example Answer:
The value at index `i` and `mask` in the `dp` 2D list is updated by adding the value at index `i-1` and `mask ^ (1 << j)` in the `dp` list. The specific values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a 2D list where elements are updated, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n), and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where elements are updated, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n), and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`**
