According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`. To ensure that the loop executes one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with updated elements, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n), and `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n+1**.
