According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the elements in the 2D list `dp` are set to 1 at the 0th row. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` should be greater than 0 and `dp` should be a 2D list with all elements initialized to 1 at the 0th row.
State: **All elements in the 2D list `dp` are set to 1 at the 0th row, `n` is greater than 0**
