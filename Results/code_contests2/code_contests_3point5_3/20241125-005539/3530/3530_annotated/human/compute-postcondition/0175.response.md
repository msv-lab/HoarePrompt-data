Example Answer:
The loop iterates over the range of `(1, 1 << n)` for `mask` and `(0, n)` for `j`. For each combination of `mask` and `j`, it checks if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and if the `j`-th bit is set in `mask`. If both conditions are met, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Finally, the code prints `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged.

Output State: **After the loop executes, `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`. The value of `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]` is printed.**
