According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list updated according to the specified formula, n is greater than 1, i is incremented by 1, and j is the next value where `a[i][j]` is equal to 1. To execute the loop one more time, the next value of `j` should be determined based on the conditions specified. If the conditions are met, `dp[i][mask]` should be updated accordingly. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **dp is a 2D list updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 1, i is incremented by 1, j is the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1**
