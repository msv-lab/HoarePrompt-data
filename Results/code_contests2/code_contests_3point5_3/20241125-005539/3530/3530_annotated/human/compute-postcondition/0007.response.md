According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times based on the variable `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer + 1. To execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer + 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer + 2, `a` contains the mapped integers from the input**
