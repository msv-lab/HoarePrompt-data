Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`. `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `a` is a 2D list. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo MOD. This condition covers the case where the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` results in a non-zero value.***
