Postcondition: ***dp is a 2D list updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD. n is greater than 1. i is incremented by 1. j is the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is increased by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and the result is stored modulo MOD. All other elements of dp remain unchanged.***
