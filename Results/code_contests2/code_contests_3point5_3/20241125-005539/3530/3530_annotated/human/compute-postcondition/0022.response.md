According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, all elements in the 2D list `dp` are set to 1 at the 0th row does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0.
State: **All elements in the 2D list `dp` are set to 1 at the 0th row, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0**
