According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. Since `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which should be updated to `j is 2`.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `a` is a 2D list**
