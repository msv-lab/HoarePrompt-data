According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than (1 << n). At the end of the last iteration, `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1. This means that the loop executed until (1 << n) and `i` reached that value. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to (1 << n) and no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where each element is initialized to 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to (1 << n)**
