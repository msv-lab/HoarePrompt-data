Postcondition: ***All elements in the 2D list `dp` are set to 1 at the 0th row. `n` is greater than 0. `mask` is 1. `j` is 0. If the element at index (i-1, j) in the 2D list `a` is 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is also 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`.***
