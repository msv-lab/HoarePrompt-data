According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is the next value where `a[i][j]` is equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value where `a[i][j]` is equal to 1.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the next value where `a[i][j]` is equal to 1, `mask` includes the j-th bit**
