Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `mask` ranges from 1 to 1 << n + 1, and `j` is incremented by 1. After the execution, the output state is: `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `mask` ranges from 1 to 1 << n + 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `mask` ranges from 1 to 1 << n + 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1**
