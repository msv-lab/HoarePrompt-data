Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 1, i is incremented by 1, j is the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1. The previous value of a[i - 1][j] is 1 and the jth bit of the mask is also set, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j].
Output State: **dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 1, i is incremented by 1, j is the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1.
