Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list where elements are updated. `n` is a positive integer. `mask` is the next value within the range (1, 1 << n). `j` is a non-negative integer less than `n`. If a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulus of the previous value of dp[i][mask] with MOD.***
