Postcondition: ***dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD. n is greater than 1, j is 0. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and the result is taken modulo MOD. This update occurs under all possible conditions and edge cases, ensuring that the values in dp are correctly computed and stored.***
