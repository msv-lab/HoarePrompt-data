The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function works with predefined parameters `n` and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of lists of integers with dimensions n x n, where each integer is either 0 or 1. The function does not return any value; instead, it performs some operations or calculations based on the values of `n` and `a`.
