Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`. `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is stored in `dp[i][mask]` after taking the modulus operation. This condition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases based on the given program fragment.***
