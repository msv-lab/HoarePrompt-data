According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0. Therefore, to execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All elements in the 2D list `dp` are set to 1 at the 0th row. `n` is greater than 0. `mask` is 1. `j` is 1**
