According to the code, the loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer. Since the loop will execute at least once, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: After the loop executes, `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 1**
