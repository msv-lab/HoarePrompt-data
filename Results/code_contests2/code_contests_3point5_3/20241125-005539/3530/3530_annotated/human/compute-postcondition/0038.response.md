According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD` ensures that the loop will execute. So no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0**
