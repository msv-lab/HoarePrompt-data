According to the code, the loop can execute if n is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that n is greater than 0, i is incremented by 1, and j is the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1.
State: **dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 1, i is incremented by 1, j is the next value where a[i][j] is equal to 1**
