According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1. Since `j` is 1, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to be incremented by 1.
State: **All elements in the 2D list `dp` are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, where each element `dp[i][mask]` is the remainder of the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`. `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2**
