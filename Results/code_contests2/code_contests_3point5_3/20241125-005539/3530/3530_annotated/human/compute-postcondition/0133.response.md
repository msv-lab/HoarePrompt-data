According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0. Since `n` is greater than 0, it does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **dp is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD, n is greater than 1, j is 0**
