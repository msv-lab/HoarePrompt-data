Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`. Each element in `dp` is modified based on the conditions where if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. This process is applied for all valid combinations of `i`, `mask`, and `j`, ensuring that the elements in `dp` are properly adjusted according to the given logic.***
