According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`. In order for the loop to execute, `j` needs to be 0. 
State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
