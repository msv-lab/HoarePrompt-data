Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and shifted 1 by `j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo MOD. Various outcomes are accounted for, ensuring proper handling of `dp` values based on specific conditions in the if statement.***
