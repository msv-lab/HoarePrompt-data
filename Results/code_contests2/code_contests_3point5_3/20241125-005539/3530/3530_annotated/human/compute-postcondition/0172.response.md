Output State: After the loop executes, `dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`. `n` is greater than 1. For each iteration of the loop, if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulus with `MOD`. This postcondition remains valid for all possible scenarios and edge cases. In cases where the loop does not execute, the values of variables remain unchanged, as the loop is not entered.
