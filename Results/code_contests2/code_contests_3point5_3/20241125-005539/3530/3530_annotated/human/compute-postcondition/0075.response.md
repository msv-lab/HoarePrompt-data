Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0. `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `mask` has the `j`th bit set, and now `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
