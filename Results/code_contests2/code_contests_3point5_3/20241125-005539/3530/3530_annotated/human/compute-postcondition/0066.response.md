Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `a` is a 2D list. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. This condition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios for the given program fragment.***
