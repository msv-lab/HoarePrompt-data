Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a` is a 2D list. The element in the (i-1)th row and jth column of `a` is 1 and the bit at position j in `mask` is 1. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
