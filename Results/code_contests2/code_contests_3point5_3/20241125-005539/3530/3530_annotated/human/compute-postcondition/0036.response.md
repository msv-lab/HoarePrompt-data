Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where all elements are updated according to the formula `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] % MOD`. The elements in `dp` are first updated with the remainder of the previous value divided by `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the `j`-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. This process ensures that the elements in `dp` are consistently updated according to the given logic, maintaining the initial conditions and handling all possible edge cases. If a[i - 1][j] is not equal to 1 or mask does not have the j-th bit set, then dp[i][mask] remains unchanged.**
