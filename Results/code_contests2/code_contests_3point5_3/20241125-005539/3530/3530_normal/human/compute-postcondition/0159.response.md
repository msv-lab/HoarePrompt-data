Output State: MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, i is 1, mask is less than 1 << n, j is 0. The element at index i-1 and j in array a is 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set. After running the code, dp[i][mask] is incremented by the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j].
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, i is 1, mask is less than 1 << n, j is 0. The element at index i-1 and j in array a is 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set. dp[i][mask] is incremented by the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taken modulo MOD.**
