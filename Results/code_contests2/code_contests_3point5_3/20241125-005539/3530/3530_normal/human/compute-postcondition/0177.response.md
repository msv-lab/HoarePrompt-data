Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It reads an input integer `n`, creates a list `a` by converting input strings to integers, initializes a 2D list `dp`, performs calculations on `dp` based on given conditions, and finally prints the value of `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]`. The function essentially calculates the number of rows in the 2D list `a` where all elements are equal to 1.**
