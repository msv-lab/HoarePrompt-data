Example Answer:
`map(int, raw_input().split())` converts the input string into a list of integers and `a.append()` adds this list to the existing list `a`. The value of `_` is 2 and `n` remains a valid input string. The value of MOD remains 1000000007. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a valid input string, `_` is 2, `a` is updated with a list of integers converted from the input string.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a valid input string, `_` is 2, `a` is updated with a list of integers converted from the input string**
