Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is valid and greater than 0. a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask is 1, j is 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 left-shifted by j yields a non-zero result, then dp[i][mask] is incremented by the value of dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 left-shifted by j], and the result is taken modulo MOD. This process covers all possible edge cases related to the conditions inside the if statement.***
