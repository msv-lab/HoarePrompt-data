Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is valid and greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask is 1, j is 0. If the element at index i of list a is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set, then dp[i][mask] is increased by the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and the resulting value is taken modulo MOD.***
