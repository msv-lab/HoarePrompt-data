According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `mask` is in the range of `1` to `1 << n` (exclusive). At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed with the previous `mask` value. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `mask` value needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **No adjustments needed, the loop will execute with the next `mask` value**
