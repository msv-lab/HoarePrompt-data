Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `mask` allows one more iteration. The element at index `i - 1` and `j` in `a` is 1 and the `j-th` bit in `mask` is set. The value at `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value at `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
