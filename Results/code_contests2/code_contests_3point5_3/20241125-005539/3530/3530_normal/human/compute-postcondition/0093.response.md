Postcondition: ***`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `mask` allows one more iteration. If the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is stored in `dp[i][mask]`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is then taken modulo `MOD`.***
