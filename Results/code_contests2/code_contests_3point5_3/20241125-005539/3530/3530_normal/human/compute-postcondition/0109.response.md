Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask allows one more iteration, the next value of mask is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, j is 0. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the modulo MOD. This ensures that the program maintains the necessary conditions while updating the dp array based on the given logic. All edge cases, including the boundaries of the mask value and the values in dp array, are handled during the execution of the if statement.***
