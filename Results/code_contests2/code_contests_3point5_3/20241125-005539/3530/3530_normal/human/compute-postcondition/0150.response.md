Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variable `i` is 1, `mask` and `j` values are not specified in the initial state. The output state after running the code will be: `MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is further updated, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `n + 1.
Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is further updated, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `n + 1**
