Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. The previous values of the variables indicate that `MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `mask` is less than 1 << n, and `j` is 2. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, i is 1, mask is less than 1 << n, j is 2.
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, i is 1, mask is less than 1 << n, j is 2**
