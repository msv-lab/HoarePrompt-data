Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, i is 1, mask is less than 1 << n, j is 1. If a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and mask bitwise AND 1 << j is true, dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 << j] and then taken modulo MOD.***
