According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is a valid input string. Since `_` is less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a valid input string, `_` is 1, a is updated with a list of integers converted from the input string**
