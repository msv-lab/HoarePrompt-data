Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and incrementing it. After that, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD` which is 1000000007. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD remains 1000000007, n is valid and greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask is 1, j is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated and modulo `MOD` is taken.
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is valid and greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask is 1, j is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated and modulo `MOD` is taken**
