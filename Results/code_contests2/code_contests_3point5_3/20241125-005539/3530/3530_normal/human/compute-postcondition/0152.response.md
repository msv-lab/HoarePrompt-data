Postcondition: ***`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is further updated, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `n + 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`.***
