According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0 and `j` is increased by 2. To ensure that the loop executes one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n + 2`.
State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is further updated based on the conditions in the if part, `mask` allows one more iteration, and `j` is less than `n + 2**
