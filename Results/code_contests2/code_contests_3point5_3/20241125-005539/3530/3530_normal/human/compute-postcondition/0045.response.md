Example Answer:
The code takes the modulo of dp[i][mask] with MOD. The value of MOD remains constant at 1000000007. Therefore, the output state is: MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid input string and not equal to 0, a contains updated integers, dp is updated based on the calculation dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], mask is (1 << n) - 1, j is less than n.
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid input string and not equal to 0, a contains updated integers, dp is updated based on the calculation dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], mask is (1 << n) - 1, j is less than n**
