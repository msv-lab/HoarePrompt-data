Output State: 
- MOD remains 1000000007.
- `n` is a valid integer greater than 0.
- `a` contains updated integers.
- `dp` array is updated.
- `i` is 1.
- The loop iterates over all possible values of `mask` from 1 to 1 << n, and for each `mask`, it iterates over all values of `j` from 0 to n-1.
- If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the sum modulo MOD.
- The loop will not execute if the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` is not satisfied for any value of `j`.
- In the case where the loop does not execute, all variables remain in their initial states without any changes.
