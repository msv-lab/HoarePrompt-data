Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, input string `n` is a valid non-zero value, list `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated based on the calculation, `mask` value is within the range (1 << n) - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. This logic ensures that the state of the program variables is correctly maintained and updated according to the specified conditions, covering all edge cases.***
