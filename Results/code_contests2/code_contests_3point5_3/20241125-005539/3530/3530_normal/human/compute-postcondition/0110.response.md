According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask allows one more iteration, the next value of mask is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, j is 1**
