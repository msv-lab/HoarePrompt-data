Postcondition: ***`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1. For each valid `j` satisfying the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j`, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. All variables maintain their initial relationships and constraints after the execution of the if statement, accounting for all possible edge cases and boundary values.***
