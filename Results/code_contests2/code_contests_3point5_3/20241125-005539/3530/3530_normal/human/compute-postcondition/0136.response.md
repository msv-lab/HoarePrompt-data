Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then the result is taken modulo MOD. This condition covers all edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the if else block executes.***
