Example Answer:
The provided code snippet prints the value of `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]`. The loop execution updates the values of `dp` based on the given conditions and constraints. Since all scenarios and edge cases are handled, the final value of `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]` is available for printing. 
Output State: **The program prints the calculated value of dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]**
