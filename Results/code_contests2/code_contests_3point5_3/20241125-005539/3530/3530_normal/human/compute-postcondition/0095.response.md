Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variables `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not directly affected by this operation. After execution, the updated `dp` array will contain the new calculated values. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `mask` allows one more iteration, `j` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `mask` allows one more iteration, `j` is increased by 1**
