Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is updated to satisfy the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` for at least one value of `j`, `mask` is adjusted accordingly. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.**
