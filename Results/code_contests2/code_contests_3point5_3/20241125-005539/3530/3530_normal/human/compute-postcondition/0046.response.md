Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid input string and not equal to 0. The array a contains updated integers, dp is updated based on the calculation dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The mask value is (1 << n) - 1, and j is less than n. After the execution of the if block, the dp array is modified according to the condition dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then takes the modulo operation with MOD. All edge cases are handled including the scenario where a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j.***
