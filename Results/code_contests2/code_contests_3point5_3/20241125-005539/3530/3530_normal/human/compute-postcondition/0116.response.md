Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`, which remains 1000000007. This operation ensures that the value of `dp[i][mask]` stays within the range defined by `MOD`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask allows one more iteration, the next value of mask is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, j is 2.
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask allows one more iteration, the next value of mask is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, j is 2**
