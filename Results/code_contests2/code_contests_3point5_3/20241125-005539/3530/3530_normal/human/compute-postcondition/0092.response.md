Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value at `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and incrementing it. Then, the value at `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `mask` allows one more iteration, and the specified calculation is performed on `dp[i][mask]`.
