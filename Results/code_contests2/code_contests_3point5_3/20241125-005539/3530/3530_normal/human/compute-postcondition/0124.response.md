According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is a valid integer greater than 0. Since `i` is 1, it indicates that the loop has not started yet. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `j` needs to be set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
State: **MOD remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
