Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007. `n` is a valid integer greater than 0. `a` contains updated integers. `dp` array is updated. `i` is 1. `j` is 0. If the element at position (i-1, j) in `a` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the sum modulo MOD. This update covers all possible edge cases including the scenario when the condition is not satisfied.***
