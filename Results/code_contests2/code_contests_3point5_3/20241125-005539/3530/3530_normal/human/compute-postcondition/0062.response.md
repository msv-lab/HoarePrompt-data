Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, the input string `n` is valid and not equal to 0, the list `a` contains updated integers, the `dp` array is updated based on the calculation, the `mask` value is within the range (1 << n) - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask bitwise AND 1 << j is true, then dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 << j] and the result is taken modulo MOD. This condition holds for all possible values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` ensuring the integrity of the program variables after the execution of the if statement.***
