Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask allows one more iteration, the next value of mask is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, j is 2.
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask allows one more iteration, the next value of mask is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, j is 2**
