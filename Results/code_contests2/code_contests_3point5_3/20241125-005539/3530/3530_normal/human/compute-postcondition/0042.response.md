Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007. n is a valid input string and not equal to 0. The list a contains updated integers. dp stores calculated values based on the conditional update provided in the loop code with dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n) initialized with zeros. mask is (1 << n) - 1. If a[i - 1][j] is 1 and the jth bit is set in mask, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking modulo MOD. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program execution.***
