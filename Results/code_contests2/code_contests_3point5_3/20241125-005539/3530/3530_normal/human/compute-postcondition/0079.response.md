Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided, so the output state is: MOD remains 1000000007, n is valid and greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask is 1, j is 1.
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is valid and greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask is 1, j is 1**
