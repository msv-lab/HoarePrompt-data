Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is valid and greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask is 1, j is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and 1 shifted left by `j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
