Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value modulo `MOD`. As the values of `i` and `j` are 1, and `mask` is not provided, the output state is: MOD remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is 1.
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
