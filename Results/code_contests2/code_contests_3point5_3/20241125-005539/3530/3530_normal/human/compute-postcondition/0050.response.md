Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid input string and not equal to 0, the array a contains updated integers, dp is updated based on the calculation dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], where the mask value is (1 << n) - 1, and j is less than n. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask has the jth bit set, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the result modulo MOD.***
