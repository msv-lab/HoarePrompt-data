Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a valid input string and n is not 0, `a` is updated with a list of integers converted from the input string, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n) filled with zeros, `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1 where i ranges from 0 to (1 << n) - 1, `mask` starts from 1, `j` is 0. The element at index (i - 1, j) of list `a` is 1 and the `mask` has the 1 bit shifted left by `j`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
