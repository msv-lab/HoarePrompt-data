According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `n + 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is further updated, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `n + 1**.
