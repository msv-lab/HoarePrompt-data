Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of the current value with `MOD`. The value of `MOD` remains constant. Therefore, the output state is MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask allows one more iteration, the next value of mask is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, j is 0, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the calculation mentioned above.
