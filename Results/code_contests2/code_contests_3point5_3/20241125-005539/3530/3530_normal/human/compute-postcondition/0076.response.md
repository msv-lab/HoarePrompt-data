Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulo operation with MOD. This ensures that the value of dp[i][mask] remains within the range defined by MOD. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD remains 1000000007, n is valid and greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask is 1, j is 0. The element at index i of list a is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set. The value of dp[i][mask] is increased by the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j].
