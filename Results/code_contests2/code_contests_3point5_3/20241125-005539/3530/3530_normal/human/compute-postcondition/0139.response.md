According to the code, the loop can execute for all values of `mask` from 1 to 2^n-1. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop did execute, so we need to adjust the states to ensure that the loop can execute again.

Based on the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` and the fact that the loop executes for all values of j from 0 to n-1, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `i` should remain as 1.
- `n` should remain as a valid integer greater than 0.
- `a` should contain updated integers.
- `dp` array should be updated.
- `j` should start from 0 for the next iteration.
- The condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` should be satisfied for at least one value of `j`.
- The loop should execute, so all other states should remain the same as the end of the previous iteration.

State: **MOD remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` is satisfied for at least one value of `j`.**
