According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1. Since `j` is 1, it needs to be adjusted to be less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need adjustment.
State: **MOD remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `n**.
