Example Answer:
`a` is declared as an empty list. The previous values of `MOD` and `n` are known to be 1000000007 and an input string respectively. Therefore, the output state is: MOD is 1000000007, `n` is an input string, `a` is an empty list.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is an input string, `a` is an empty list**
