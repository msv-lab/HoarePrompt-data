According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **MOD remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 2, the loop iterates over all possible values of `mask` from 1 to 1 << n, and for each `mask`, it iterates over all values of `j` from 0 to n-1.**
