Postcondition: ***`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a valid input string and n is not 0, `a` is updated with a list of integers converted from the input string, `dp` contains the calculated values based on the conditional update described above, `mask` starts from 1, `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. This condition covers all possible scenarios involving the specified variables and their relationships after the execution of the if statement.***
