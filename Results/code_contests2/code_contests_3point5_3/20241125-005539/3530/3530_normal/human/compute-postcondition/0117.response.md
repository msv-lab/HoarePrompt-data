Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007. `n` is a valid integer greater than 0. `a` contains updated integers. `dp` array is updated. `mask` allows one more iteration, and the next value of `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n. `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo MOD. All variables maintain their respective initial values and relationships after the execution of the program fragment, handling all possible edge cases.***
