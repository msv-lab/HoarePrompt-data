Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided, so the output state is: MOD remains 1000000007, input string `n` is valid and not equal to 0, list `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated based on the calculation, `mask` value is within the range (1 << n) - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2 and the `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j].
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, input string `n` is valid and not equal to 0, list `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated based on the calculation, `mask` value is within the range (1 << n) - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2 and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
