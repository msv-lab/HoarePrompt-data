Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `mask` are known, and the elements at position (i-1, j) in `a` and the j-th bit of `mask` are also specified. Therefore, we can calculate the result based on these values.
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. The element at position (i-1, j) in `a` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set**.
