Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are known to be 1. The array `dp` is updated, and `MOD` remains constant. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, i is 1, mask is less than 1 << n, j is 1.
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, i is 1, mask is less than 1 << n, j is 1**
