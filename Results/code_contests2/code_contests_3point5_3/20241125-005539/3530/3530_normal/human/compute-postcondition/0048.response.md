Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The value of mask is (1 << n) - 1, and j ranges from 0 to n-1. After this operation, dp is updated based on the calculation dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The MOD value remains constant at 1000000007. 
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid input string and not equal to 0, the array a contains updated integers, dp is updated based on the calculation dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], mask value is (1 << n) - 1, and j is less than n**
