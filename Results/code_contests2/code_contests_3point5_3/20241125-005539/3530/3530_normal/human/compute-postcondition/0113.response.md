Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask allows one more iteration, the next value of mask is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, j is 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask bitwise AND operation with 1 << j is true, then dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 << j] and the result is taken modulo MOD.***
