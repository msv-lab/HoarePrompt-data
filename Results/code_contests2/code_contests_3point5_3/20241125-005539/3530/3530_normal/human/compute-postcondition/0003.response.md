According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value of `n`. If `n` is a valid input string, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, MOD is 1000000007, which does not affect the loop execution. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` is a valid input string and `_` starts from 0.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a valid input string, `_` is 0**
