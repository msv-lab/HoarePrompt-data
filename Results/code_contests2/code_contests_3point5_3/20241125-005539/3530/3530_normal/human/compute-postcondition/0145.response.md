According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `n`**
