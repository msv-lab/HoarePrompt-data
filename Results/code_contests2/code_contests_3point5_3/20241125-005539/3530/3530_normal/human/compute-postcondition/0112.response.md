Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with MOD. The values of MOD, n, a, dp array, mask, and j remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask allows one more iteration, the next value of mask is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, j is 1.
Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is a valid integer greater than 0, a contains updated integers, dp array is updated, mask allows one more iteration, the next value of mask is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, j is 1**
