Postcondition: ***`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a valid input string and n is not 0, `a` is updated with a list of integers converted from the input string, `dp` contains the calculated values based on the conditional update described above, `mask` starts from 1, `j` is 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the modulo with MOD. This update is applied to dp[i][mask] in all relevant cases, ensuring the integrity of the calculated values.***
