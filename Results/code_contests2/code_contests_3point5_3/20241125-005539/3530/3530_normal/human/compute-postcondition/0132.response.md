Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 left shifted by j is true, then dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask XOR 1 left shifted by j], and finally, dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD.***
