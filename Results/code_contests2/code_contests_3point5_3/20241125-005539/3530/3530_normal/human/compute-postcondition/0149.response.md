According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `n`, and `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `n + 1**
