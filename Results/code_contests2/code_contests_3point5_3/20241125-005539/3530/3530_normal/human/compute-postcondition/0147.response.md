Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`, which is 1000000007. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `n`**
