Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, the input string `n` is valid and not equal to 0, the list `a` contains updated integers, the `dp` array is updated based on the calculation, the `mask` value is within the range (1 << n) - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. If the element at index `i-1` and index `j` in list `a` is equal to 1 and the bit at position `j` in `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo MOD.***
