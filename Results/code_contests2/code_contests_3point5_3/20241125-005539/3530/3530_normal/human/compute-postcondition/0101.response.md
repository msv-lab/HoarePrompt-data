Postcondition: ***`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is further updated based on the conditions in the if part, `mask` allows one more iteration, and `j` is increased by 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` allows the bit at position `j` to be set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. This logic ensures that the program progresses according to the specified conditions, updating the necessary variables and arrays accordingly.***
