According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n+1` to satisfy the condition `j` < `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **MOD remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
