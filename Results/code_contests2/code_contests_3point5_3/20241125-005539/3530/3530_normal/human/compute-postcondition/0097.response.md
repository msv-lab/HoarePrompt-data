Postcondition: ***`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `a` contains updated integers, `dp` array is updated, `mask` allows one more iteration, and `j` is increased by 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases after the execution of the if statement.***
