You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: There are N men and N women, both numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N.

For each i, j (1 \leq i, j \leq N), the compatibility of Man i and Woman j is given as an integer a_{i, j}. If a_{i, j} = 1, Man i and Woman j are compatible; if a_{i, j} = 0, they are not.

Taro is trying to make N pairs, each consisting of a man and a woman who are compatible. Here, each man and each woman must belong to exactly one pair.

Find the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 21
* a_{i, j} is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_{1, 1} \ldots a_{1, N}
:
a_{N, 1} \ldots a_{N, N}


Output

Print the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.
