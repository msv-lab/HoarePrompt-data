The function reads input from the user, processes a list of numbers, and checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive numbers in the list is greater than or equal to 2. If such a pair is found, it prints 'NO', otherwise 'YES'. However, there is a potential issue in the code where it tries to print using square brackets instead of parentheses. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the input list is empty, leading to potential unexpected behavior.
