Output State: `nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element. If the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in nums is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, and the loop terminates. The program ensures that the absolute difference condition is satisfied for all pairs of elements in `nums` if `flag` remains False after the execution of the if statement. If `nums` has less than 2 elements initially, the loop will not execute and `flag` remains True. If all pairs of elements in `nums` already satisfy the absolute difference condition, the loop does not execute and `flag` remains True.
