According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element. Additionally, there must exist a pair of consecutive elements in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2 for `flag` to be set to False. 

Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted such that `nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element, and there exists a pair of consecutive elements in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2. 
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element, there exists a pair of consecutive elements in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2**
