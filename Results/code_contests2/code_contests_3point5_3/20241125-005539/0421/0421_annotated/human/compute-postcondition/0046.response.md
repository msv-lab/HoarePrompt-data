According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element, there exists a pair of consecutive elements in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` less than the length of `nums` minus 1.
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element. There exists a pair of consecutive elements in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2. `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1**
