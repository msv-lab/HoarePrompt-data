Output State: **If there are at least 2 elements in `nums`, the maximum element is removed from the list. If the absolute difference condition mentioned before is met, `flag` is set to False and the loop breaks. If the condition is not met for all pairs of elements, `flag` remains True. If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `flag` remains True.**
