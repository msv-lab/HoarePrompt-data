Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element. If the absolute difference condition is not met for any pair of elements, `flag` is set to False, and the loop is exited. The program ensures that the absolute difference condition is satisfied for all pairs of elements in `nums` if `flag` remains False after the execution of the if statement.***
