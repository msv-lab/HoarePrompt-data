According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the `nums` list. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` list minus 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `ai` is a list of integers such that 1 <= ai <= 100, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3**
