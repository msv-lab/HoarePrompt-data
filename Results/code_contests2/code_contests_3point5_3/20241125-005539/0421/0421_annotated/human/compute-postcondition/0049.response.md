Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element. There exists a pair of consecutive elements in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2. `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the loop or if statement is terminated.***
