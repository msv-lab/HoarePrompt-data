According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If nums has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nums` should be adjusted based on the removal of the maximum element. Additionally, the `flag` should be updated to False if the absolute difference condition was met for all pairs of elements.
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element, `flag` is False if the absolute difference condition was met for all pairs of elements.**
