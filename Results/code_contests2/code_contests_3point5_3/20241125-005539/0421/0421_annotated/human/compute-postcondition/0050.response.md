According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element. There exists a pair of consecutive elements in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element. There exists a pair of consecutive elements in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2. `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1 and `i` is incremented by 1**
