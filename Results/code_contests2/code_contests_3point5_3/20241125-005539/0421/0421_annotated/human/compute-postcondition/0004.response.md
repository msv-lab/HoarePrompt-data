Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `ai` is a list of integers such that 1 <= ai <= 100, `flag` is True, `nums` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0. The absolute difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i+1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2***
