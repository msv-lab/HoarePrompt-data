According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the maximum element is removed if there are at least 2 elements in `nums`, and the absolute difference condition may or may not have been met. If the condition was not met for all pairs of elements, `flag` remains True. If there are fewer than 2 elements in `nums`, the loop does not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- If the maximum element was removed, update `nums` accordingly.
- If the absolute difference condition was met for all pairs of elements, update `flag` to False.
State: **Adjust `nums` based on the removal of the maximum element, and update `flag` to False if the absolute difference condition was met for all pairs of elements.**
