According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since the loop breaks if the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, the values of nums[i] and nums[i + 1] should be such that the condition is not met. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `ai` is a list of integers such that 1 <= ai <= 100, `flag` is True initially. `nums` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
