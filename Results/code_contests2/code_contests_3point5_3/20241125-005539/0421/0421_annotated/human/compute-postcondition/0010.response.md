Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `ai` is a list of integers such that 1 <= ai <= 100, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
