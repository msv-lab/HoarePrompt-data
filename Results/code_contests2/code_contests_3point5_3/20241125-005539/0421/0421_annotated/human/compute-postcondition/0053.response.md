According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the maximum element has been removed from `nums` and the condition for setting `flag` to False is if there exists a pair of consecutive elements with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. If there exists a pair of consecutive elements with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2 in the modified `nums`, then `flag` should be set to False.
2. If there are no such pairs in the modified `nums`, then `flag` should remain True.
3. `nums` should not be empty for the loop to continue.
