Output State: **The loop executes based on the conditions of consecutive elements in nums. If any pair has an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2, flag is set to False and the loop breaks. If all pairs satisfy the condition, flag remains True. After the loop finishes, the flag will be either True or False. The output will be either 'NO' if flag is False or 'YES' if flag is True.**
