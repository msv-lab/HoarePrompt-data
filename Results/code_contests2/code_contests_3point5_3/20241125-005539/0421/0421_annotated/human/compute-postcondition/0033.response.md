According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 3 elements after removing the maximum element. So for the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must still have at least 3 elements after removing the maximum element. Additionally, if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, the flag is set to False and the loop breaks. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **nums has at least 3 elements after removing the maximum element, flag is not set to False, loop did not break**.
