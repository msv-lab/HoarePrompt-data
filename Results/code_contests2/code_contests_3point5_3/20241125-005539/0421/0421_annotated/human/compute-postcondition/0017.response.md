Output State: **If there are at least 2 elements in `nums`, the loop will check if the absolute difference between each element and the next one is greater than or equal to 2. If such a case is found, `flag` is set to False and the loop breaks. If the loop goes through all elements without finding such a case, `flag` remains True. If `nums` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `flag` remains True.**
