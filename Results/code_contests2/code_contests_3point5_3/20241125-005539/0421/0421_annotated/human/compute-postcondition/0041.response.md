Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element, and there exists a pair of consecutive elements in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2. If for any pair of consecutive elements in `nums`, the absolute difference is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the loop breaks.***
