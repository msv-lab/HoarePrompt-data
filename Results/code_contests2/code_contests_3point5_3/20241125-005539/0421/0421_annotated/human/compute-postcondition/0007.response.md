Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `ai` is a list of integers such that 1 <= ai <= 100, `flag` is True initially. `nums` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i+1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the loop breaks. The code covers all edge cases and updates the state of the program accordingly.***
