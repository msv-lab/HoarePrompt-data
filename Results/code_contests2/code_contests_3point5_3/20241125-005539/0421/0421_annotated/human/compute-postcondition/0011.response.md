Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `ai` is a list of integers such that 1 <= ai <= 100, `flag` is True initially. `nums` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop.***
