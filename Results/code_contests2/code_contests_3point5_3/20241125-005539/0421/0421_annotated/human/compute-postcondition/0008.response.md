According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `ai` is a list of integers such that 1 <= ai <= 100, `flag` is True initially. `nums` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
