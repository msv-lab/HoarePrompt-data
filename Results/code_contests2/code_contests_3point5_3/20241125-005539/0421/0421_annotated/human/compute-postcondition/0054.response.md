Output State: **If nums has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute at least once. If any pair of consecutive elements in nums has an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2, flag is set to False and the loop breaks. If all pairs of consecutive elements satisfy the condition, flag remains True. If nums has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and flag remains True. After the loop finishes, flag will be either True or False depending on the conditions met during the loop execution.**
