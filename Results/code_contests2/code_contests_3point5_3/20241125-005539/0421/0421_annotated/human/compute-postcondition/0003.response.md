According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. If the `nums` list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `ai` is a list of integers such that 1 <= ai <= 100, `flag` is True, does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `nums` list must have at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `ai` is a list of integers such that 1 <= ai <= 100, `flag` is True, `nums` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
