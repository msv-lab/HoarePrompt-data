According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element. So for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `nums` must be at least 3. 
State: **`nums` has at least 3 elements after removing the maximum element, `flag` is False**
