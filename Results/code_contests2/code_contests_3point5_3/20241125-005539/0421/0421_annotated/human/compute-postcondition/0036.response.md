According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element. This condition satisfies the requirement for `nums` to be non-empty. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if any two consecutive elements in `nums` have an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2. If such a pair exists, `flag` should be set to False. If all pairs of elements already satisfy the condition, the loop will not execute, and `flag` remains True.
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element, and if there exists a pair of consecutive elements in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False.**
