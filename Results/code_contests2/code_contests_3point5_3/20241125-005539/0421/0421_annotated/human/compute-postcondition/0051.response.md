Output State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element. If there exists a pair of consecutive elements in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False. If no such pair exists, `flag` remains True after the loop executes. The loop will not execute if `nums` has less than 2 elements after removing the maximum element.**
