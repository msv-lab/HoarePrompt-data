According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element, and there exists a pair of consecutive elements in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the `i` should be less than the length of `nums` minus 2 to ensure the loop doesn't go out of bounds. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum element, and there exists a pair of consecutive elements in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2**
