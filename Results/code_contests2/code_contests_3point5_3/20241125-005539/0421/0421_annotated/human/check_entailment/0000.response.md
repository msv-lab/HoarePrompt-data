Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where there are multiple stacks of ravioli with a height difference of 2 or more next to each other. This violates the algorithm described in the problem statement. For example, if the input array is [3, 1, 2], the program will output "YES" incorrectly because it does not consider the fact that the ravioli from the stack of height 3 will slide on the stack of height 1 before the tallest stack is chosen for the first time. The correct output should be "NO". Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
