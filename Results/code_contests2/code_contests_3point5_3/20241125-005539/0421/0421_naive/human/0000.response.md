Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. It iterates through the input array and checks if there are any adjacent stacks that differ in height by two or more. If such a case is found, it sets the flag to False and breaks out of the loop. Then it removes the tallest stack of ravioli from the array and continues this process until all stacks have been removed.

The program then prints "YES" if the flag is still True after processing all the stacks, indicating that the array can be sorted correctly using the described procedure. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

After reviewing the code and considering different scenarios, it can be concluded that the program handles all cases as described in the problem statement. Hence, the correctness of the program is True.
