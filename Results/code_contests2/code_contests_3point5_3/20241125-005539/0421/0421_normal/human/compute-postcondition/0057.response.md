Functionality: **The function takes user input, processes a list of integers, and iterates through the list to check if the absolute difference between consecutive elements is less than 2. If this condition holds for all elements, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If the list has less than 2 elements, it always prints 'YES'.**
