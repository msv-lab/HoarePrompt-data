Output State: **If `nums` has less than 2 elements, `flag` is True. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between the maximum element in `nums` and the next maximum element is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is False. The maximum element in `nums` is removed after each iteration. If `nums` has the maximum element removed, the loop does not execute.**
