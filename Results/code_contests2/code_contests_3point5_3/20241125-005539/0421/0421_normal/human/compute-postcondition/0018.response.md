Example Answer: 
The maximum value in nums is removed. If nums originally had 2 or more elements, the loop would execute. If the absolute difference between adjacent elements in the modified nums is less than 2 for all pairs, flag will remain True. Otherwise, flag will be set to False.
Output State: **nums contains less than 2 elements, flag is True**
