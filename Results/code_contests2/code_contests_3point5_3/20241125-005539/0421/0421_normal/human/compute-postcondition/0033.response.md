According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the index `i` is less than the length of `nums - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2` should not be met, meaning the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` should be less than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` contains at least 2 elements, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2, for some `i` less than the length of `nums - 1`**
