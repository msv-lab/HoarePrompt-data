According to the code, the loop can execute if the length of `nums` is at least 2. In addition, the condition states that the absolute difference between the maximum element and the next maximum element in `nums` must be greater than or equal to 2 for `flag` to be True. Before the loop starts, `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `nums` has a length of at least 2, the absolute difference between the maximum element and the next maximum element in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 0.
State: **`flag` is True, `nums` has a length of at least 2, the absolute difference between the maximum element and the next maximum element in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0**
