According to the code, the loop can execute again if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` contains at least 2 elements. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` must be less than 2.
State: **`nums` contains at least 2 elements, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2**
