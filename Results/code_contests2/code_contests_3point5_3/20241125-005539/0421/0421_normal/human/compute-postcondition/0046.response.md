According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the conditions involving `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]`, as well as the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is not guaranteed, the length of `nums` is at least 2, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` needs to be maintained as a boolean, the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` must be checked to determine the new value of `flag`, the length of `nums` should remain at least 2, and `i` should be updated to 2.
State: **`flag` is a boolean, absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` is checked to update `flag`, length of `nums` is at least 2, `i` is 2**
