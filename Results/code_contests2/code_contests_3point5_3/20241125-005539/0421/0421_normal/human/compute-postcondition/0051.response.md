Output State: **The loop checks the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the list `nums`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The loop executes from index 0 to len(nums) - 2. If the absolute difference condition is not met for any pair of consecutive elements, `flag` remains True. If the length of `nums` is less than 2, the loop does not execute.**
