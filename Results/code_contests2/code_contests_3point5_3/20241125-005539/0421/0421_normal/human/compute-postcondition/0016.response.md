According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a map object containing integers with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a map object containing integers with a length of at least 2, `i` is 2**
