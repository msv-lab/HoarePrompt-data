According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the map object `nums`. If the length is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `flag` being True does not determine the execution of the loop. Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object containing integers with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 0.
State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is a map object containing integers with a length of at least 2, `i` is 0**
