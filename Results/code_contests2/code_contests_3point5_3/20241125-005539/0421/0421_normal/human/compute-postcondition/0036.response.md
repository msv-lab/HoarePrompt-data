According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, if the absolute difference between the maximum element in `nums` and the next maximum element is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the loop is broken. Otherwise, the maximum element in `nums` is removed.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If the loop is to execute one more time, the condition `flag` needs to be True.
2. The `nums` list should not be empty.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustment should be made:
State: **If the absolute difference between the maximum element in `nums` and the next maximum element is not greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty**
