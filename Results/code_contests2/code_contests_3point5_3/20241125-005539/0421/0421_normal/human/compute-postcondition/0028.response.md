Postcondition: ***`nums` contains at least 2 elements. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, and the loop is broken. Otherwise, there is no change to the initial state, and the program continues normally. `flag` is False if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.***
