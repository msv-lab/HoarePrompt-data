According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` contains at least 2 elements. To execute the loop one more time, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` must not be greater than or equal to 2, and `flag` should not have been set to False. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`nums` contains at least 2 elements. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, and the loop is broken. In any other case, there is no change to the initial state, and the program continues normally.**
