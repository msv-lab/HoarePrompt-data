According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `nums` contains at least 2 elements. Since the loop iterates over `len(nums) - 1`, the value of `i` can range from 0 to len(nums) - 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `flag` is True, and `i` is 0.
State: **`nums` contains at least 2 elements, `flag` is True, `i` is 0**
