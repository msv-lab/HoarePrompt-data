Postcondition: ***`nums` contains at least 2 elements, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2. If the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2` is met, then `flag` is set to False, and the loop or if statement is exited. All other elements and variables remain unchanged.***
