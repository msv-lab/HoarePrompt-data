According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a map object containing integers with a length of at least 2, `i` is 0. 

To execute the loop one more time, the condition `i < len(nums) - 1` needs to be satisfied. Since `i` is 0 at the end of the last iteration, it needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a map object containing integers with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1**
