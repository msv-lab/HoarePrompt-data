According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is True, `nums` has a length of at least 2, and `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`flag` is True, `nums` has a length of at least 2, `i` is 1**
