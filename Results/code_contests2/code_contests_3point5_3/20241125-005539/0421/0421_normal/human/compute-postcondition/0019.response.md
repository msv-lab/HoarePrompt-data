According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` contains less than 2 elements and `flag` is True. For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` needs to contain at least 2 elements.
State: **nums contains at least 2 elements, flag is True**
