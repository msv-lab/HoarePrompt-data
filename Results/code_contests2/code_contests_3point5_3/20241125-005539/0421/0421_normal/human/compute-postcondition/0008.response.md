According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition involving `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]`. If the absolute difference between these two values is not greater than or equal to 2, the loop will continue. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a map object containing integers with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 0. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the absolute difference between `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` is not greater than or equal to 2, then the loop will execute again. 
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a map object containing integers with a length of at least 2, `i` is 0**
