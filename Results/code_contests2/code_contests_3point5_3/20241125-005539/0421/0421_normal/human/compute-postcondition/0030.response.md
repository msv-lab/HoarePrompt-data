Example Answer:
`flag` is assigned the boolean value `False`. Since no other variables are involved, the output state is simply `nums` contains at least 2 elements, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2, `flag` is False.
Output State: **`nums` contains at least 2 elements, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2, `flag` is False**
