According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If both `flag` and `nums` are True, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop does not execute, which means either `flag` is False or `nums` is empty. For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` needs to be True and `nums` should not be empty. Additionally, the maximum element from `nums` must be added back for the loop to execute.
State: **The loop does not execute, `nums` has the maximum element removed, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty and the maximum element is added back**
