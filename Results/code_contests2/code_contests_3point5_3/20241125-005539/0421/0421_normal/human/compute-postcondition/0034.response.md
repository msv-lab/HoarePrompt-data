Output State: *`nums` contains at least 2 elements. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, and the loop is broken. Otherwise, there is no change to the initial state, and the program continues normally. If the loop does not execute due to the condition not being met, the initial state remains unchanged with `flag` being True.*
