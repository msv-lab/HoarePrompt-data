Postcondition: ***`flag` is a boolean variable. If the absolute difference between the maximum element and the next maximum element in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2 for the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to False and the program breaks. The initial conditions of `flag` being True, `nums` having a length of at least 2, and `i` being 0 are maintained. In all other scenarios where the absolute difference condition is not met, the program continues without altering the state of `flag`, `nums`, or `i`.***
