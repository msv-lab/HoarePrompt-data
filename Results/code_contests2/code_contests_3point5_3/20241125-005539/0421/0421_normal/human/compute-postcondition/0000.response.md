Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input as a string. The value of `n` is unknown as it depends on the user input. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer. ai is a list of integers where each element satisfies 1 <= ai <= 100.**
Output State: **Precondition: n is a positive integer. ai is a list of integers where each element satisfies 1 <= ai <= 100.**
