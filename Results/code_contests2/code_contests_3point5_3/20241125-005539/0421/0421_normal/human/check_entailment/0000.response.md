Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints mention that the algorithm will output "YES" if the array can be sorted using the described procedure and "NO" if it cannot. However, the code only checks if the absolute difference between consecutive elements is less than 2, which is not sufficient to determine if the algorithm will sort the array correctly. 

The code does not account for the scenario where two stacks of ravioli are next to each other and differ in height by two or more, causing the top ravioli of the taller stack to slide down on top of the lower stack. This means that the code may incorrectly output "YES" even if the array cannot be sorted correctly according to the described algorithm. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
