The function takes user input and checks if the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9' are present in the input string. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and updates the input string to 'tstr123'. If none of these characters are present, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value.
