Example Answer:
The string `a` is reassigned to 'tstr123'. The variables `p` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing characters with ASCII code between 33 and 126 inclusive, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is not 'H', 'Q', or '9'.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing characters with ASCII code between 33 and 126 inclusive, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is not 'H', 'Q', or '9'**
