Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string. The initial state specifies the range of ASCII codes in the string, so the output state is: `p` is a string containing characters with ASCII code between 33 and 126 inclusive, `a` is an input string.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing characters with ASCII code between 33 and 126 inclusive, `a` is an input string**
