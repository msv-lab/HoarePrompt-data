Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing characters with ASCII code between 33 and 126 inclusive. If `i` is either 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program prints 'YES', sets `a` to 'tstr123', and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program does not print anything, `a` remains unchanged, and no break occurs.***
