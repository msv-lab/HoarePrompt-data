According to the code, the loop can execute if the input string `a` is not empty. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to indicate that `a` is not an empty string. Since the loop iterates over each character in the input string `a`, the loop will execute as long as there is at least 1 character in the string.

State: **`p` is a string containing characters with ASCII code between 33 and 126 inclusive, `a` is a non-empty string**
