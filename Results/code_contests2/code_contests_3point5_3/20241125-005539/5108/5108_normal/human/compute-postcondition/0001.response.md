According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `a`. If `a` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `p` is a string containing characters corresponding to the HQ9+ programming language instructions and other characters, and `a` is a non-empty string.
State: **`p` is a string containing characters corresponding to the HQ9+ programming language instructions and other characters, `a` is a non-empty string**
