Example Answer:
The value of `a` is changed to 'tstr123', so the previous value 'tstr1234' is no longer valid. The value of `p` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing characters corresponding to the HQ9+ programming language instructions, `a` is 'tstr123'.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing characters corresponding to the HQ9+ programming language instructions, `a` is 'tstr123'**
