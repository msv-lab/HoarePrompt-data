Example Answer:
The value of `p` is not used in the code snippet provided, so it remains unaffected. The value of `a` is 'tstr123' and there are no changes to it. The keyword `break` does not have any impact in this context as it is not within a loop or switch statement. Therefore, the output state is: `p` is a string containing characters corresponding to the HQ9+ programming language instructions, `a` is 'tstr123'.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing characters corresponding to the HQ9+ programming language instructions, `a` is 'tstr123'**
