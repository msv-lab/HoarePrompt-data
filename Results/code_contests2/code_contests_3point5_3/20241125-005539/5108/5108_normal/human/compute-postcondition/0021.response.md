Postcondition: ***If the input string `a` contains 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program will print 'YES', set `a` to 'tstr123', and break out of the loop. If `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', then `p` remains unchanged and `a` is the original input string. In cases where `a` does not contain 'H', 'Q', or '9', the loop does not execute, leaving `p` unchanged and `a` as the original input string.***
