Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly reads a single line input, iterates through each character in the input, and checks if the character is one of the valid HQ9+ instructions ('H', 'Q', '9'). If any of these instructions are found, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop, ensuring that the output is "YES". If none of the valid instructions are found, it prints "NO". This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making the program correct.
