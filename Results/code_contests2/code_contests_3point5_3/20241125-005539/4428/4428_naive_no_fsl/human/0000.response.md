Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by iterating through the string S and incrementing the result by 1 for each 'I' and decrementing the result by 1 for each 'D'. It then ensures that the result does not go below 0. The logic is sound and the program will output the maximum value of x reached during the operations. It covers all possible cases and handles them correctly.
