Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'I' and 'D' characters, i is 1, S[i] is either 'I' or 'D' depending on the specific scenario. If S[i] is 'I', then result is increased by 1. If S[i] is 'D', then result is decreased by 1. After the execution of the if-else block, the value of result is determined by the character at S[i], where if S[i] is 'I', result is increased by 1; if S[i] is 'D', result is decreased by 1. In all cases, the values of N, S, and i remain unchanged.***
