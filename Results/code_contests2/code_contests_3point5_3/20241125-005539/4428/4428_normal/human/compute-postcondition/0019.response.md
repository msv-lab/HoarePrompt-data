Postcondition: ***If S contains only 'D' characters, the loop will not execute and result will remain 0. If S contains only 'I' characters, the loop will execute N times, and result will be equal to N. For any other combination of 'I' and 'D' characters in S, the final value of result will depend on the difference between the count of 'I' and 'D' characters in S. The value of result is negative***
