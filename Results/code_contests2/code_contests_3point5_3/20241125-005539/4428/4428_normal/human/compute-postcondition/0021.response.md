Postcondition: ***If S contains only 'D' characters, the loop will not execute and the result will remain 0. If S contains only 'I' characters, the loop will execute N times, and the result will be equal to N. For any other combination of 'I' and 'D' characters in S, the final value of the result will depend on the difference between the count of 'I' and 'D' characters in S. After the execution of the if statement, if the result is less than 0, it will be updated to 0.***
