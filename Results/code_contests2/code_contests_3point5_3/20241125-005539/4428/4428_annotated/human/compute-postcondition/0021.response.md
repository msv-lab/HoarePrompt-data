Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', result is an integer. If the character at index i in string S is 'I', then result is increased by 1. If the character at index i in string S is not 'I', then result is decreased by 1. If S is an empty string, the loop does not execute and result remains 0. After the execution of the if statement, if result is less than 0, it is reset to 0. All the initial conditions and relationships among N, S, and result are maintained.***
