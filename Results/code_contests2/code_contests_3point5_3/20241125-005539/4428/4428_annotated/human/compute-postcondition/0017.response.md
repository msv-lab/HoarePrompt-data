According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, N > 1. To execute the loop one more time, `N` should still be greater than 1 and `i` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **N > 2, S is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D', result is an integer, i is incremented by 1**
