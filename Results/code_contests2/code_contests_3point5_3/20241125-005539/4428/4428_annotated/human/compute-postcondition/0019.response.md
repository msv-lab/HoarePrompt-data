Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', result is an integer. The character at index i in string S is 'I' when result is less than 0, and the character at index i in string S is 'D' when result is greater than or equal to 0. If S is an empty string, the loop does not execute and result remains 0.***
