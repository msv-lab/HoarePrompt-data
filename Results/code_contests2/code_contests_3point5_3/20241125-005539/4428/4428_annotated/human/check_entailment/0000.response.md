Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by initializing x to 0 and then iterating over the string S to increment x by 1 if the character is 'I' and decrement x by 1 if the character is 'D'. After the loop, it checks if x is less than 0 and sets it to 0 if so. The program handles all cases where the characters in the string are either 'I' or 'D' as specified in the problem description. The logic is sound and the program outputs the correct maximum value of x based on the given string S.
