The function reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user input. It then calculates the number of digits in `a` and stores it in `c`. The function proceeds to find `a % b` and iterates through each digit of `a`, updating `ans` to the minimum value between its current value and the new calculated remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The loop continues until `c` becomes 0 or `a` becomes 0, handling scenarios where `a` is negative or 0. Finally, the function prints the resulting `ans`.
