Example Answer:
`copya` is assigned the value of `copya` divided by 10. Since `copya` was initially the same as `a`, and `a` is an input integer, dividing by 10 causes `copya` to lose the last digit of `a`. The value of `c` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is the input integer `a` with the last digit removed.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is the input integer `a` with the last digit removed**
