The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates on Stepan's positive integer, which is a positive integer without leading zeros and has a length between 2 and 200,000 digits (inclusive). The integer m is also a parameter such that 2 <= m <= 10^8. The function returns the result of some computation or operation on Stepan's integer based on the value of m.

Functionality: **The function performs a computation or operation on Stepan's positive integer based on the value of m, where m is an integer between 2 and 10^8.**
