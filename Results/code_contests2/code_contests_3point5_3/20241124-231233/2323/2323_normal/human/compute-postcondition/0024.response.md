Output State: 
- If the initial value of `a` is greater than 0: `a` is updated to be the result of integer division of `a` by 10, `c` is the number of digits in the original `a` minus 1, `b` remains unchanged, `copya` is `a` with the last digit removed.
- If the initial value of `a` is 0 or negative: `a` is updated to be the result of integer division of `a` by 10, `c` is 0, `b` remains unchanged, `copya` remains the same as the original `a`, `ans` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by `b`.
Output State: **Depends on the initial value of `a`**
