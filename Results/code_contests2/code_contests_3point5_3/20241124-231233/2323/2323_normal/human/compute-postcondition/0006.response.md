According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is the input integer `a` with the last digit removed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `copya` needs to be not equal to 0. This means that `a` should have more than one digit.
State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is the input integer `a` with the last digit removed and `a` has more than one digit**
