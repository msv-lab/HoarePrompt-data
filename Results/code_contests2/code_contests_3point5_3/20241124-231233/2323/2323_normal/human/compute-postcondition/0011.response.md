Example Answer: 
`c` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `c` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is updated after integer division by 10.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is updated after integer division by 10**
