Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `a` is an input integer, but it is not used in the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state is `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
