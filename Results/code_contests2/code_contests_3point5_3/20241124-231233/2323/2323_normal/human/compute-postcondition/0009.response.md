According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is the input integer `a` with the last digit removed and `a` has more than one digit. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `copya` needs to be adjusted to be not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is not equal to 0**
