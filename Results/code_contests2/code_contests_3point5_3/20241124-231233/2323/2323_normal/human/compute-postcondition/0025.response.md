Postcondition: ***If `a` is greater than 0, then `c` is the number of digits in `a` - 1, `b` remains unchanged, `copya` is the result of removing the last digit from `a`, and `ans` is updated based on the minimum value between its current value and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. If the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` is the new last digit of `a`. If `a` is 0 or negative, `c` is 0, `b` remains unchanged, `copya` remains the same as `a`, and `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.***
