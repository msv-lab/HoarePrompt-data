Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by removing the last digit through integer division by 10. If `a` is an input integer with more than one digit, then `copya` will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is the input integer `a` with the last digit removed and `a` has more than one digit.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is the input integer `a` with the last digit removed and `a` has more than one digit**
