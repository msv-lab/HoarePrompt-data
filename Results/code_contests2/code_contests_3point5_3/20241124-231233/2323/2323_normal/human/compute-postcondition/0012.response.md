According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, and `copya` is updated after integer division by 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must be not equal to 0. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `copya` should not be equal to 0.
State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is updated after integer division by 10 and `copya` is not equal to 0**
