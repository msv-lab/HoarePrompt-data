Example Answer:
`copya` is integer divided by 10 using the floor division operator. The value of `copya` is not given, so after execution, `copya` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is updated after integer division by 10.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is updated after integer division by 10**
