Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum remainder of the division by the given number m among all good shifts of Stepan's integer. It iterates through all possible cyclic shifts of the integer and calculates the remainder for each shift, keeping track of the minimum remainder found so far. The logic of the program is sound and it follows the problem description accurately. The program handles cases where the integer has leading zeros and ensures that all good shifts are considered without missing any. Overall, the program is correct and provides the expected output for all inputs.
