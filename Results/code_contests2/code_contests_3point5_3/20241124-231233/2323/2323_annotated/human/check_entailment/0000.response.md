Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes an integer as input and calculates the minimum remainder of the division by the given number `m` among all good shifts of the integer. It iterates through all possible good shifts of the integer and calculates the remainder after division by `m`, keeping track of the minimum remainder found. The logic of shifting the digits of the integer and updating the remainder is correctly implemented. The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and there are no edge cases where the program fails to provide the correct output. Hence, the program is correct.
