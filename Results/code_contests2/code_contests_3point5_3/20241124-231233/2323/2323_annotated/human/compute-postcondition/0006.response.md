According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 10. So for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` should not be equal to 0. This means `a` should be divisible by 10. No other states need adjustment.
State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, `a` is an input integer divisible by 10, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 10**
