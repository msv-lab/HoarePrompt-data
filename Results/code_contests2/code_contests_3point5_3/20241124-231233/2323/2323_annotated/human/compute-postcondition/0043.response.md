Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer with a certain number of digits, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in `a`, `copya` is a positive integer without leading zeros, `i` is 2, `c` is greater than 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. If a is not divisible by 10, `a` is updated to be 10 times the value of `a` with `c` digits, and `ans` is recalculated. If a is divisible by 10, `a` is updated through integer division by 10. In all cases, the variables `m`, `b`, `copya`, and `i` remain unchanged, ensuring the integrity of the initial state.***
