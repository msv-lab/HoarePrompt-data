According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be a non-zero positive integer. At the end of the previous iteration, `copya` is updated by floor division by 10. So, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `copya` needs to be a positive integer without leading zeros. 
State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, `a` is an input integer divisible by 10, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 10, `copya` is updated by floor division by 10 and `copya` is a positive integer without leading zeros**
