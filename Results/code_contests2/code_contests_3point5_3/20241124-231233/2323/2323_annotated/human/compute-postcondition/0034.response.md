Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in `a`, `copya` is a positive integer without leading zeros, `i` is 1, `c` is greater than 0. If the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` is set to the last digit of `a`, `a` is updated to have `h` as the first digit and the original `a` without the last digit. Then, the remainder of `a` divided by `b` is calculated and stored in `ans`. If the last digit of `a` is 0, `h` is set to the last digit of `a`, `a` is updated to have `h` as the first digit and the original `a` without the last digit.***
