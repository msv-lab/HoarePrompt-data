Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in `a`, `copya` is a positive integer without leading zeros, `i` is 0, `c` is greater than 0. If `a % 10 != 0`, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `a` is calculated as 10 raised to the power of `c` multiplied by `h` plus `a`, and `ans` is updated as the minimum value between the current `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. If `a % 10 == 0`, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `a` is updated as 10 raised to the power of `c` multiplied by `h` plus `a`, and `a` is the result of `a` divided by 10.***
