According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is a positive integer without leading zeros. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, `a` is an input integer divisible by 10, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 10, `copya` is updated by floor division by 10, and `copya` is a positive integer without leading zeros and `copya` is greater than 0**
