Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case when Luba finishes reading the book exactly on the last day. For example, if the input is:

```
3 2
0 0 2
```

The program will output `3`, indicating that Luba finishes reading on the 3rd day. However, in this case, Luba actually finishes reading on the 2nd day. The program should be modified to consider this edge case.
