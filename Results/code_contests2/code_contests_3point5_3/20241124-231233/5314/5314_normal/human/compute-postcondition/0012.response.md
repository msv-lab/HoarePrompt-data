Output State: **If t is greater than 86400, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6 and greater than 0, a is a list containing the input values split by spaces, i is the number of iterations until t becomes less than or equal to 86400. If t is less than or equal to 86400, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is 0 or a negative integer, a is a list containing the input values split by spaces, i is the number of iterations until t becomes less than or equal to 86400.**
