According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6 and greater than 0. To ensure the loop executes one more time, t needs to be adjusted to be strictly greater than 0.
State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6 and greater than 0, a is a list containing the input values split by spaces, i is 3**
