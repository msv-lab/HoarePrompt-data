Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decreased by 86400 minus the integer value at index `i` in list `a`. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6, `a` contains input values, and `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6 and greater than 0, a is a list containing the input values split by spaces, i is 1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6 and greater than 0, a is a list containing the input values split by spaces, i is 1**
