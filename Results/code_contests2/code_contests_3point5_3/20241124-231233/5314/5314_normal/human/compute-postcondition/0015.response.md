Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for `n` and `t` and a list `a`, then iterates over the list `a` reducing `t` by the difference of 86400 and the current element in `a` until `t` is less than or equal to 0. It then prints the number of iterations `i`. The function does not explicitly return any value. Potential edge cases to consider are when `t` reaches 0 before iterating through all elements in `a` and when the input values do not match the expected constraints.**
