Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decreased by 86400 minus the integer value found at index 2 of list `a`. The previous values of `n`, `t`, `a`, and `i` are positive integers, so after execution, the new value of `t` will be the previous value of `t` minus 86400 minus the integer value found at index 2 of list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6 and greater than 0, a is a list containing the input values split by spaces, i is 2.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6 and greater than 0, a is a list containing the input values split by spaces, i is 2**
