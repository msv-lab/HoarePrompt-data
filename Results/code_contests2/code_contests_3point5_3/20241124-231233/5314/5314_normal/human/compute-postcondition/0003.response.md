Example Answer: 
The value of `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 minus the integer value at index `i` of list `a`. The value of `t` may change based on the specific value at index `i` of list `a`. The value of `i` remains 0 after the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6, a is a list containing the input values split by spaces, i is 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6, a is a list containing the input values split by spaces, i is 0**
