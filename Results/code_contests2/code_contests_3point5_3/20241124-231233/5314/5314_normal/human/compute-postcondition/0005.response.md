According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` needs to be adjusted to greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6 and greater than 0, a is a list containing the input values split by spaces, i is 1**
