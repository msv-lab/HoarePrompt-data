Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned the values returned by `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`. If the input values are valid, `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `t` will be a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^6**
