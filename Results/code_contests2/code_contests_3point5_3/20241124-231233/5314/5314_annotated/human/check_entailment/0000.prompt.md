You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Luba bought a very interesting book. She knows that it will take t seconds to read the book. Luba wants to finish reading as fast as she can.

But she has some work to do in each of n next days. The number of seconds that Luba has to spend working during i-th day is ai. If some free time remains, she can spend it on reading.

Help Luba to determine the minimum number of day when she finishes reading.

It is guaranteed that the answer doesn't exceed n.

Remember that there are 86400 seconds in a day.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and t (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ t ≤ 106) — the number of days and the time required to read the book.

The second line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400) — the time Luba has to spend on her work during i-th day.

Output

Print the minimum day Luba can finish reading the book.

It is guaranteed that answer doesn't exceed n.

Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n, t = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    a = raw_input().split()
    i = 0
    while t > 0:
        t -= 86400 - int(a[i])
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If the sum of all elements in list `a` is greater than 86400 * t, then the loop will execute at least once. After the loop finishes, `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is the number of elements in `a`, and `t` is a specific value based on the calculations `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])` where `t` is greater than or equal to 0. If the sum of all elements in list `a` is less than 86400 * t, the loop won't execute and `i` will be 0, `t` will remain the same.
    print(i)

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
