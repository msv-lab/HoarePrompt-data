Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where Luba does not finish reading the book within the given time `t`. In this case, the program should output `n+1` as Luba will need an additional day to finish reading the book. However, the program only outputs the minimum day Luba can finish reading the book without considering this edge case.
