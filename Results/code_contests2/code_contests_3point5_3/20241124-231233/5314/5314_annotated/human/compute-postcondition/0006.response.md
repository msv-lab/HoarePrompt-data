Example Answer:
`t` is decreased by `86400 - int(a[i])`. Since `i` is 1, `a` contains inputs split by spaces, and `t` is decreased by 86395, the new value of `t` will depend on the specific value in `a[1]`. The output state will be: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 1, `t` is a specific value based on the calculation `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])`.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 1, `t` is a specific value based on the calculation `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])`**
