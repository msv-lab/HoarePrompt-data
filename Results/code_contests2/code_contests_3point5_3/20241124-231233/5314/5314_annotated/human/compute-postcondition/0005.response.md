According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decreased by 86395. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` should be greater than or equal to 86395 and `t` currently must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 1, `t` is decreased by 86395 and `t` is greater than or equal to 86395**
