Example Answer: 
The code splits the input received from raw_input() into a list `a`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, and `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces**
