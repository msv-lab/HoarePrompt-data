Output State: **If the sum of all elements in list `a` is greater than 86400 * t, then the loop will execute at least once. After the loop finishes, `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is the number of elements in `a`, and `t` is a specific value based on the calculations `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])` where `t` is greater than or equal to 0. If the sum of all elements in list `a` is less than 86400 * t, the loop won't execute and `i` will be 0, `t` will remain the same.**
