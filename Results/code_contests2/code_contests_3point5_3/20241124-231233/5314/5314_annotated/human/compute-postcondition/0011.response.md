According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a specific value based on the calculation `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])` where `t` is greater than or equal to 86400. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- The specific value of `t` after the calculation `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])` should be greater than 0 to ensure the loop continues.
- Since `i` is 3, the value of `a[i]` should be taken into consideration to adjust the value of `t` accordingly.

State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 3, `t` is a specific value greater than 0 after the calculation based on `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])` where `t` is greater than or equal to 86400**
