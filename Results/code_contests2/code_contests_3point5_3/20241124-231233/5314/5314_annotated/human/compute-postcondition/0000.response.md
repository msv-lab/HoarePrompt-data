Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input()` accepts input and `split()` splits the input by spaces. The values of `n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6**
