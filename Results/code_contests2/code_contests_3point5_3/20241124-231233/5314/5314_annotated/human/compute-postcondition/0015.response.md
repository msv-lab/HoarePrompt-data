Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n` and `t`, followed by a list `a`. It then iterates through the elements of `a` and subtracts each element from the value of `t` until `t` becomes non-positive. The function prints the number of elements processed (`i`) during the iteration. The loop executes at least once if the sum of elements in `a` exceeds 86400 * t. The function operates without explicit parameters.**
