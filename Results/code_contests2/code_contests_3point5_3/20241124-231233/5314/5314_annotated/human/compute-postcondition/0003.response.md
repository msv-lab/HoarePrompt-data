Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decremented by the result of the expression 86400 - int(a[i]), where `a[i]` is the value at index 0 of the list `a`. The value of `t` and `a[i]` can vary, but assuming `a[i]` is 5, the expression evaluates to 86395, so `t` is decremented by 86395. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 0, and `t` is decreased by 86395.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the inputs split by spaces, `i` is 0, `t` is decreased by 86395**
