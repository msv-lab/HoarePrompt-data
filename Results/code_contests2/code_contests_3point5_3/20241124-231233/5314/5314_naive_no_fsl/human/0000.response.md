Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It does not handle the case where Luba has extra time to read the book after finishing her work on a particular day. The program only subtracts the time spent on work from the total time needed to read the book, without considering any extra time that can be used for reading on a given day.

For example, consider the input:
```
2 10
2 5
```
The correct output should be 1, as Luba can finish reading the book on the first day with 5 seconds left. However, the program will output 2 as it will only subtract 2 from the total time needed to read the book.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
