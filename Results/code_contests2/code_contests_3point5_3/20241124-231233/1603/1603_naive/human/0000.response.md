Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem description. It simply prints a string of '10' repeated n//2 times and appends '1' if n is odd. This does not take into account the visitors' preferences and does not maximize the beauty of the segments. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
