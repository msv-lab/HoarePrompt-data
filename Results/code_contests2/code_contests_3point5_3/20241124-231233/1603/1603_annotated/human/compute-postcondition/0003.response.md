Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where `n` and `m` should be positive integers within the range [1, 1000]. It then prints a string that consists of '10' repeated `(n // 2)` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd. The function does not explicitly return a value. **
