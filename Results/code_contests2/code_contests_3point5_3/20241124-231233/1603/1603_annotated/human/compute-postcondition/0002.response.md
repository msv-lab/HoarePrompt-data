The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function works with the constraints provided for positive integers n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 10^3. Each pair of integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) represents a valid segment that the i-th visitor will visit. The function then processes these inputs and performs some operations based on the given constraints. The return value of the function is not specified in this case.
