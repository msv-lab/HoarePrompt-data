Example Answer:
The code prints the string '10' repeated n//2 times, followed by '1' if n is an odd number. Given that n is between 1 and 1000, the output string will consist of '10' repeated n//2 times and '1' appended at the end if n is odd.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, the code prints a specific string based on the value of `n`.**
