Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting them to integers. As per the preconditions, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000**
