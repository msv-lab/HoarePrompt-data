Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from input, then prints a string consisting of '10' repeated `n//2` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd. This aligns with the problem description as it ensures each position contains either a rose or a lily. The output examples provided also match the expected output based on the given input. Since the code aligns with the problem description and produces the correct output for the examples provided, the correctness is considered True.
