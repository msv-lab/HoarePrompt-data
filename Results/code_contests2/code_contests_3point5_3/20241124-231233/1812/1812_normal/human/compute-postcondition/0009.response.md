Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'); C is the difference between the ASCII value of the last character of s and 'a'. If M is either 1 or 2, then N is updated to either N - 1 or N - 2, M is changed to 3 XOR M, and N is updated to N + M. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios where M can be 1 or 2, ensuring that the program correctly updates the variables N and M based on the conditions.***
