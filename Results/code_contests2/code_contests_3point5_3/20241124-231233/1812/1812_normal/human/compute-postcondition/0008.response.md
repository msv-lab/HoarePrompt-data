Example Answer: 
N is updated by adding the value of M. The value of M can be 1 or 2, so N will be updated to either N + 1 or N + 2 depending on the previous value of M. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'); C is the difference between the ASCII value of the last character of s and 'a', M is updated to either 2 or 1 based on its previous value, N is updated by either N + 1 or N + 2 based on the new value of M.
