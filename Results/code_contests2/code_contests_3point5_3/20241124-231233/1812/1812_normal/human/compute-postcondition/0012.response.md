Functionality: **The function `func` reads input data, processes it to determine the price of a ticket based on the seat position, and then calculates and prints the price of the ticket. The price calculation is dependent on whether the seat is on the aisle ('a' or 'f'), middle ('b' or 'e'), or window ('c' or 'd'). However, there seems to be a missing explanation regarding how the price is determined based on the seat position. The functionality should include clarifying how the price calculation based on the seat position is implemented in the code.**
