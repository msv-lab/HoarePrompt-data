Example Answer:
The lambda function `gets` is defined to read a line from the standard input and strip any leading or trailing whitespaces. The function does not affect the initial state variables `n` and `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f').**
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the row number, and s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f').**
