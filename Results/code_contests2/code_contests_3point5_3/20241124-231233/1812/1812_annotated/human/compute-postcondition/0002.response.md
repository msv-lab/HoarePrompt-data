Example Answer: 
`N` is assigned the integer value of `S` after stripping the last character. The value of `S` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace stripped. Therefore, the output state is: lambda function `gets` is defined with a default parameter `r` that reads a line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace; `S` contains the input string after stripping whitespace, `N` is the integer value of `S` after stripping the last character.
