Functionality: **The function defines a lambda function 'gets' that reads a line from standard input and strips whitespace. It then processes the input string to calculate values for N, C, and M based on certain operations. If M is 1 or 2, adjustments are made to N and M. Finally, the function prints a calculated result based on the values of N, C, and M. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.**
