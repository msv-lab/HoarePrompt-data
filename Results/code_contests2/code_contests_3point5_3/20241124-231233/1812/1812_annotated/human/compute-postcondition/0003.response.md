Example Answer:
The variable `C` is assigned the value of the Unicode code of the last character of string `S` minus the Unicode code of 'a'. The value of `S` contains the input string after stripping whitespace. The value of `N` is the integer value of `S` after stripping the last character. Therefore, the Output State is: lambda function `gets` is defined with a default parameter `r` that reads a line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace; `S` contains the input string after stripping whitespace, `N` is the integer value of `S` after stripping the last character, `C` is the result of the computation `ord(S[-1]) - ord('a')`.
