Example Answer: 
The lambda function `gets` reads a line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. The value returned by `gets` is assigned to variable `S`. The output state is: lambda function `gets` is defined with a default parameter `r` that reads a line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace; `S` contains the input string after stripping whitespace.
Output State: **lambda function `gets` is defined with a default parameter `r` that reads a line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace; `S` contains the input string after stripping whitespace**
