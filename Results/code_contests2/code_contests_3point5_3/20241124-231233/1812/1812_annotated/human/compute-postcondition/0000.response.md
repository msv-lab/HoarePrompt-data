Example Answer:
The lambda function `gets` is defined with a default parameter `r` that reads a line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: lambda function `gets` is defined with a default parameter `r` that reads a line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
Output State: **lambda function `gets` is defined with a default parameter `r` that reads a line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace**
