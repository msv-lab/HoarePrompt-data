Output State: **lambda function `gets` is defined with a default parameter `r` that reads a line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace; `S` contains the input string after stripping whitespace. `N` is the integer value of `S` after stripping the last character. `C` is the result of the computation `ord(S[-1]) - ord('a')`. `M` is the result of `N - 1 & 3`. If `M` is either 1 or 2, `N` is decreased by `M`. After executing `M ^= 3`, the new value of `M` is the result of `M XOR 3`. `N` is increased by `M`. The code snippet calculates and prints the result of the expression `((N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C))`.**
