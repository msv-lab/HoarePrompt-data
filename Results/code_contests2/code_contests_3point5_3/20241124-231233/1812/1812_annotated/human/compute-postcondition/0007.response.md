Output State: **`gets` is defined with a default parameter `r` that reads a line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace; `S` contains the input string after stripping whitespace, `N` is the integer value of `S` after stripping the last character, `C` is the result of the computation `ord(S[-1]) - ord('a')`, `M` is the result of `N - 1 & 3`. If `M` is either 1 or 2, `N` is decreased by `M`. After executing `M ^= 3`, the new value of `M` is the result of `M XOR 3`.**
