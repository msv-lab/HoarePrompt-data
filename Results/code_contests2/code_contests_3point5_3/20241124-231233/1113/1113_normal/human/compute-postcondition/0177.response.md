According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `row` is not empty. Before the loop starts, nRow is an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty. Additionally, since the loop iterates over elements in `row`, the variable `i` should be updated to be the length of `row`. Lastly, since the `res` list contains `nRow` appended, it implies that `nRow` must be a part of the `row` list for the loop to execute.
State: **`nRow` is a part of `row`, `T` remains the same, `row` is not empty, `i` is the length of `row`, `res` list contains `nRow` appended**
