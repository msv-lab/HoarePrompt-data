Postcondition: ***`T` remains the same, `row` has at least one character with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is 1, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, `i` is 0, `nRow` is not an empty string. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is appended with the string representation of `i` while maintaining the initial conditions.***
