According to the code, the loop can execute if the `row` string is not empty. Before the loop starts, `row` being an input string after stripping whitespaces does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not an empty string. Also, as the loop iterates over each character in `row`, `i` should represent each character in `row`. At the start of the loop, `nRow` being an empty string does not affect the loop execution.
State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` represents each character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is an empty string**
