According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 8 and there are more elements left in `row` to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration:
- If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, so `nRow` remains an empty string.
- If `row` is non-empty:
  - If there is an element '9' in `row`, `nRow` contains '1' at the position of '9' and the rest of the elements unchanged.
  - If there is no '9' in `row`, `nRow` contains the same elements in the same order as `row`.
- `i` is less than 8.
- The `res` list contains `nRow` appended.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `row` must not be empty.
- If there is an element '9' in `row`, `nRow` should contain '1' at the position of '9' and the rest of the elements unchanged.
- If there is no '9' in `row`, `nRow` should contain the same elements in the same order as `row`.
- `i` should be less than 8.
- There should be more elements left in `row` to iterate through.

State: **`row` is a non-empty iterable object, `nRow` is updated accordingly, `i` is less than 8, more elements left to iterate through in `row`, `res` list contains `nRow` appended**
