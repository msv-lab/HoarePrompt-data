Example Answer:
The next character in `row`, represented by `i`, is concatenated to the current value of `nRow`. If '9' is found in the remaining part of `row`, `nRow` is assigned '1'. The state of `res` does not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is an empty list, `i` represents the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions mentioned.
Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` represents the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions mentioned**
