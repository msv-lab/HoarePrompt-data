According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more characters left in the `row` string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `T` remains the same, `row` has at least one character with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is 1, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, `i` is 0, `nRow` is not an empty string. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to move to the next character in the `row` string. If the next character is '9', then '1' should be appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the string representation of the next character should be concatenated to `nRow`.

State: **`T` remains the same, `row` has at least one character with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is 2, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, `nRow` is not an empty string**
