According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` iterable object. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a string. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` ends with '1'. If `i` is less than 8 and not equal to '9', `nRow` contains the value of `i`. In both cases, `row` is a non-empty iterable object with more elements left to iterate through. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
- If the last value of `i` was '9', then `nRow` should end with '2'.
- If the last value of `i` was less than 8 and not equal to '9', then `nRow` should contain the value of `i + 1`.
- The `row` iterable object should still have more elements left to iterate through.

State: **`nRow` ends with '2' or `nRow` contains the value of `i + 1`, `row` is a non-empty iterable object with more elements left to iterate through**
