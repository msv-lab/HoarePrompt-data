Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the value of the input after stripping whitespaces. The content of `row` may contain '9's that need to be replaced by '1's. The condition `i` less than 8 holds true, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, and `i` is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is the same, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespaces, '9's are replaced by '1's, `i` is less than 8, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`T` is the same, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespaces, '9's are replaced by '1's, `i` is less than 8, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, `i` is 0**
