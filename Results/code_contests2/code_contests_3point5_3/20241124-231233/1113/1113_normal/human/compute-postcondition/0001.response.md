Example Answer:
`atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))` registers a lambda function to be executed at exit. The lambda function writes the value of `sys.stdout` to the standard output. The previous value of `sys.stdout` was assigned to `io.BytesIO()`, so the output state is: `sys.stdout` is assigned to `io.BytesIO()`, and the lambda function is registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` to the standard output at exit.
Output State: **`sys.stdout` is assigned to `io.BytesIO()`, and the lambda function is registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` to the standard output at exit**
