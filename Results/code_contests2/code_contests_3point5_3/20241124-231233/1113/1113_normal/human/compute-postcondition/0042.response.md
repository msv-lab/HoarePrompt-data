Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1'. The previous value of `nRow` contains '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`. The value of `i` is 11 and `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 11, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is appended with '1'.
Output State: **`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 11, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is appended with '1'**
