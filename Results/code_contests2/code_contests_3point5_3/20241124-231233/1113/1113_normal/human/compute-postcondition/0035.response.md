Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the value of `i`, where `i` is not equal to '9'. The previous state of `nRow` is either '1' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, and the value of `i` is not '9'. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`.
Output State: **`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`**
