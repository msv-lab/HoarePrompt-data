Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a part of `row` with either '1' added to it when `i` is equal to '9', or `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`. `T` remains unchanged, `row` is not empty, and `i` is the length of `row` + 1. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios of `i` being '9' or not, ensuring that `nRow` is updated accordingly.***
