Postcondition: ***T remains the same, row has at least one element, i is the length of row plus 1, res list contains nRow appended. If i is equal to '9', nRow contains the modified row with '1' added to it. If i is not equal to '9', nRow contains the modified row with the concatenation of the previous nRow and the value of i. In both cases, nRow is a string representing the updated row after the if-else block has executed. The overall state of the program after the if-else block executes covers the scenario where the loop is to execute one more time, incrementing the value of `i` by 1, and the length of `row` remains the same. It ensures that the `nRow` is appropriately updated based on the conditions specified, either by adding '1' to it when `i` is '9' or by concatenating the previous `nRow` with the value of `i` when `i` is not '9.***
