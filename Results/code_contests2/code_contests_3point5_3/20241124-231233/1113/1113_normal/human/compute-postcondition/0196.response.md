According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop modifies rows where '9's are replaced by '1's if the row is not empty. If the row is empty, the loop does not execute. If the loop is to execute one more time, `t` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`res` contains a list of modified rows where '9's are replaced by '1's, `T` remains unchanged, `i` is the length of the last `row` processed, and `nRow` contains the modified version of `row`, if row is not empty. If the row is empty, `T` remains the same, `row` is empty, `i` is 0, and `res` remains the same.**
