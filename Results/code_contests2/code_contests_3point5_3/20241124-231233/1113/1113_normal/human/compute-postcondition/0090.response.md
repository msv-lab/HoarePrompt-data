Example Answer:
Since the code snippet appends `nRow` to the list `res`, the value of `nRow` will be added to the list `res`. If `row` is not empty, `nRow` will contain all characters of `row` but replacing any occurrences of '9' with '1'. If `row` is empty, `nRow` will remain an empty string. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **If `row` is not empty, after the loop executes, `nRow` will contain all characters of `row` but replacing any occurrences of '9' with '1'. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string.**
