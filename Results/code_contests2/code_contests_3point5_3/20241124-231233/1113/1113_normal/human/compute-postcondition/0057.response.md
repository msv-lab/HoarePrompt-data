According to the code, the loop executes for each character in the input string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 0, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `res` is appended with `nRow`, `nRow` is an empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', then the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since the loop iterates through each character in `row`, the next character needs to be considered.
- If the next character is '9', then '1' should be appended to `nRow`.
- If the next character is not '9', then the value of the next character should be appended to `nRow`.
- The index `i` should be updated to reflect the next character in the string.

State: **`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is updated to the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `res` is appended with `nRow`, `nRow` contains the modified string based on the value of the next character in `row`.**
