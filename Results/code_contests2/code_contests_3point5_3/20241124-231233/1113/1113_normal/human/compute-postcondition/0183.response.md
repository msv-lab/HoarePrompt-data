According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are elements remaining in the `row` list. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a part of `row`, `T` remains the same, `row` is not empty, `i` is the length of `row`. If `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`, and `res` list contains `nRow` appended. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` remains unchanged and `i` is appended to `nRow` in `res` list.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`nRow` is a part of `row`, `T` remains the same, `row` is not empty, `i` is the length of `row` + 1**
