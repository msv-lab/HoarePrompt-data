According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `row` and `i`. If there are more characters left in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is an empty list, `i` represents the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string. If '9' is found in the remaining part of `row`, `nRow` contains all characters of `row` concatenated together followed by '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions mentioned in the program fragment.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `res` remains as an empty list
- `i` should represent the next character in `row`
- `row` should still not be an empty string
- If '9' is found in the remaining part of `row`, `nRow` should contain all characters of `row` concatenated together followed by '1'
- If '9' is not found in the remaining part of `row`, `nRow` should be updated based on the conditions mentioned in the program fragment

State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` represents the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions mentioned in the program fragment**
