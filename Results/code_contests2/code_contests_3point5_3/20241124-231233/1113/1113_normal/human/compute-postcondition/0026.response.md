Output State: **After the loop executes, `nRow` will contain the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'. If `row` does not contain any '9' characters, `nRow` will be an exact copy of `row`. If `row` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string.**
