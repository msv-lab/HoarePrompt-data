Output State: **`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 11, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is concatenated with `i` to form the new value of `nRow`. The loop will execute at least once if `row` is not empty. If `row` is empty, the loop won't execute, and `res` will remain an empty string.**
