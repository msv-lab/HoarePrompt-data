According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are still elements left in the `row` iterable object. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty iterable object with more elements left to iterate through, `nRow` is either '1' if `i` was equal to '9' or the concatenation of the previous `nRow` with the current value of `i` if `i` was not equal to '9', `i` is less than 8, `res` list contains at least one element, and `row` is a valid string.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` should be updated by adding '1' at the end.
2. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` should be updated by concatenating the previous `nRow` with the current value of `i`.
3. `i` should be incremented to the next value for the next iteration.

State: **`row` is a non-empty iterable object with more elements left to iterate through, `nRow` is updated according to the value of `i` for the next iteration, `i` is less than 9, `res` list contains at least one element, and `row` is a valid string**
