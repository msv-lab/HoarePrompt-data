According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row` iterable object having more elements left to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, the `nRow` variable ends with '21' or contains the value of `i + 11` if `i` is '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` ends with '2' or contains the value of `i + 1'. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the `nRow` variable should end with '21' or contain the value of `i + 11` if `i` is '9'. Additionally, since the `row` iterable object still has more elements left to iterate through, the `i` variable should be updated to reflect the next element in the iterable object.

State: **`nRow` ends with '21' or contains the value of `i + 11` if `i` is '9'. The `row` iterable object still has more elements left to iterate through.**
