Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1', so if the previous value of `nRow` had '9' replaced by '1' or was an exact copy of `row`, now it will have '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row` followed by '1'. The value of `i` is 10 and `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 10, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` has an additional '1' appended at the end.
Output State: **`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 10, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` has an additional '1' appended at the end**
