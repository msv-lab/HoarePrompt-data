According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop condition is that `i` is less than 9. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next index, which is 9 in this case. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`res` will contain `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 9, `row` will remain the input string after stripping whitespace, `res` will be appended with `nRow`, `nRow` will hold the modified string based on the value of the next character in `row`.**
