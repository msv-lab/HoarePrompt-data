Postcondition: ***`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 10, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace. If `i` equals '9', then `nRow` has an additional '1' appended at the end. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the concatenation of the original `nRow` and the integer value of `i`.***
