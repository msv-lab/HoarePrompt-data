According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the `row` string. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is an empty list, `i` represents the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string. If `i` is '9', then '1' is added to `nRow`. Otherwise, the next character in `row` represented by `i` is added to `nRow`. To execute the loop one more time, the next character in `row` needs to be processed, so `i` should represent the character after the one processed in the last iteration. `nRow` should also be updated accordingly based on the processing of the character. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` represents the character after the one processed in the last iteration in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is updated based on the processing of the character**
