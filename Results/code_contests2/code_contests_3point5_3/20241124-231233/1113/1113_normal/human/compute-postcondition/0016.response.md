Postcondition: ***`sys.stdout` is assigned to `io.BytesIO()`, lambda function is registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` to standard output at exit, `input` is assigned `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the float value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is set to the first character in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input string which is not empty. If the first character of `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to include '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to include the first character of `row` that is not '9'. The state of the program after the if else block covers all possible cases, ensuring `nRow` is correctly updated based on the initial character of `row`.***
