Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its current value. Since the initial state of `nRow` is a part of `row`, after the update, `nRow` will be the original value of `nRow` with '1' appended. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is a part of `row` with '1' appended, `T` remains the same, `row` is not empty, `i` is the length of `row` and equal to '9', `res` list contains `nRow` appended.
Output State: **`nRow` is a part of `row` with '1' appended, `T` remains the same, `row` is not empty, `i` is the length of `row` and equal to '9', `res` list contains `nRow` appended**
