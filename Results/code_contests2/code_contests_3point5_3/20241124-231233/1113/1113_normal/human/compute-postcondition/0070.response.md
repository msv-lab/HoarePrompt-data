According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T` determines the number of iterations. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` will contain modified versions of the input strings where '9' is replaced by '1' or an exact copy of the original string. If the loop does not execute, `res` will remain an empty list. `i` and `row` will be updated according to the loop's progress, and `nRow` will contain the modified string based on the input character.**
