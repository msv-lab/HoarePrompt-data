According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more characters left in `row`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is an empty list, `i` represents each character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string. If the character '9' is found in `row`, `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` contains all characters of `row` concatenated together.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `res` remains an empty list
- `i` represents the next character in `row` after the last iteration
- `row` is not empty
- If there is a '9' character in the remaining part of `row`, `nRow` should be '1'
- If there is no '9' character in the remaining part of `row`, `nRow` should contain all characters of `row` concatenated together

State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` represents the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string. If '9' is found in the remaining part of `row`, `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` contains all characters of `row` concatenated together**
