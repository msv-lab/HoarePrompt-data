According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, so it needs to be adjusted to `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.
State: **`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace**
