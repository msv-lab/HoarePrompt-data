Output State: **If row is empty, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, T remains the same, row has at least one element, i is the length of row, res list contains nRow appended. If i is equal to '9', nRow contains the modified row with '1' added to it. If i is not equal to '9', nRow contains the modified row with the concatenation of the previous nRow and the value of i. In both cases, nRow is a string representing the updated row after the if-else block has executed.**
