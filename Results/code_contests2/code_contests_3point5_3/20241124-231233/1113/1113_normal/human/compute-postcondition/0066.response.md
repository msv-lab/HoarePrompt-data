Output State: **After the loop executes, `res` will contain `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`. `i` will be updated to the index of the next character in `row`, `row` will remain the input string after stripping whitespace, `res` will be appended with `nRow`, `nRow` will hold the modified string based on the value of the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', '1' will be appended to `nRow`; otherwise, `i` will be directly concatenated to `nRow`. The loop will execute at least once if there are characters in `row`, but if `row` is an empty string, the loop will not execute and `res` will remain the same as the initial state.**
