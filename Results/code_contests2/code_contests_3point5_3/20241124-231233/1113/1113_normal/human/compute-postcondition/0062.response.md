Example Answer: 
`nRow` is appended with '1', so the value of `nRow` changes based on the previous value of `nRow`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After the if-else block executes, `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is updated to the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `res` is appended with `nRow`, `nRow` contains the modified string based on the value of the next character in `row`.
