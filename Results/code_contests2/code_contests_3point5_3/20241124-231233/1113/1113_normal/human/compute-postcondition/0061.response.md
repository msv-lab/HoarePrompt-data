According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is updated to the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `res` is appended with `nRow`, `nRow` contains the modified string based on the value of the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`; otherwise, `i` is appended to `nRow`. 

To execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` needs to be updated to the index of the next character in `row`
- `row` needs to be updated to the input string after stripping whitespace
- `res` needs to be appended with `nRow`
- `nRow` needs to contain the modified string based on the value of the next character in `row`

State: **After the if-else block executes, `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is updated to the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `res` is appended with `nRow`, `nRow` contains the modified string based on the value of the next character in `row`**
