Example Answer:
When `nRow` and `i` are concatenated, the value of `i` is added to the end of `nRow`. Since `i` is less than 8, the value of `i` is added to `nRow`. Therefore, the value of `nRow` changes accordingly based on the value of `i` and the previous value of `nRow`.
Output State: **`nRow` contains 'i', where 'i' is the value of `i` less than 8 and `i` is less than 8.**
