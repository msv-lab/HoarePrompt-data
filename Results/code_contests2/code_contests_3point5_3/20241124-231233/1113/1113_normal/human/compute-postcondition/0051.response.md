According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `row` string. Since `i` is initialized as 9, it seems to be used as an index for iterating over the characters in `row`. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that `row` is not empty, and `i` is set to 0 to start iterating from the beginning of the string.
State: **`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 0, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `res` is appended with `nRow`, `nRow` is an empty string**
