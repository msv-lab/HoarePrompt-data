According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements remaining in the `row` string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 11, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is concatenated with `i` to form the new value of `nRow`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the `row` string needs to be processed. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next character in the `row` string.
State: **`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 12, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace**
