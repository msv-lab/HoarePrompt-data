Postcondition: ***`T` remains the same, `row` has at least one element, `i` is the length of `row` plus 2, `res` list contains `nRow` appended. `nRow` is appropriately updated based on the conditions specified: if `i` is '9', '1' is added to `nRow`, otherwise, the previous `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. The postcondition covers all scenarios, including the case when `i` is '9' and when `i` is not '9, ensuring that `nRow` is updated correctly based on the conditions***
