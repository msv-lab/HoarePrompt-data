Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the next character `i` to it. The initial state of `nRow` is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is an empty list, `i` represents the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, and `nRow` is updated based on the conditions mentioned in the program fragment.
Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` represents the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, and `nRow` is updated based on the conditions mentioned in the program fragment**
