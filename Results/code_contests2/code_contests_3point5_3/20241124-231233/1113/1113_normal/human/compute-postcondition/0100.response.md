According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` iterable object. If there are more elements in the `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a string that depends on the value of `i`, `i` is less than 8, and `row` is a non-empty iterable object. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to a value that allows the loop to continue, and the `row` should have more elements left.

State: **`nRow` is a string. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` contains '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the value of `i`. In both cases, `i` is less than 8, `row` is a non-empty iterable object, and `i` is set to an appropriate value, `row` has more elements left to iterate through.**
