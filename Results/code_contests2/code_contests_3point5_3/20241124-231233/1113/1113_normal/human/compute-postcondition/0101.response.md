Example Answer:
Since `nRow += '1'` appends '1' to the end of `nRow`, the new value of `nRow` will be the previous value of `nRow` with '1' added to the end. As `nRow` is already a string and we are appending '1' to it, the new `nRow` will be the previous value of `nRow` followed by '1'. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is a string ending with '1', `i` is equal to '9' or a value less than 8, `row` is a non-empty iterable object, and `row` has more elements left to iterate through.
Output State: **`nRow` is a string ending with '1', `i` is equal to '9' or a value less than 8, `row` is a non-empty iterable object, and `row` has more elements left to iterate through**
