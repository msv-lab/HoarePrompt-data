Output State: **After the loop executes, `res` will contain modified versions of the input strings where '9' is replaced by '1' or an exact copy of the original string. If the loop does not execute (e.g., input is empty), `res` will remain an empty list. The variables `i` and `row` will be updated according to the loop's progress, and `nRow` will contain the modified string based on the input character.**
