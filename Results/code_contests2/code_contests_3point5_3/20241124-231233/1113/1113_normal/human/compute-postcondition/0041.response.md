According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more characters in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 10, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace. If `i` equals '9', then `nRow` has an additional '1' appended at the end. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the concatenation of the original `nRow` and the integer value of `i`. To execute the loop one more time, the `row` should have more characters, and `i` should still be less than the length of `row`.
State: **`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 11, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace**
