Output State: 
If `row` is an empty iterable object, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string. 
If `row` is a non-empty iterable object, after the loop execution: 
- If there is an element '9' in `row`, `nRow` contains '1' at the position of '9' and the rest of the elements unchanged. 
- If there is no '9' in `row`, `nRow` contains the same elements in the same order as `row`. 
- `i` is less than 8 after the loop execution, and `row` still has more elements left to iterate through.
