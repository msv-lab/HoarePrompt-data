According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least one element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` remains the same does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `T` remains the same, `row` has at least one element, `i` is the length of `row`, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, `nRow` contains the modified `row`, `nRow` is an empty string.
State: **`T` remains the same, `row` has at least one element, `i` is the length of `row`, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, `nRow` contains the modified `row`, `nRow` is an empty string**
