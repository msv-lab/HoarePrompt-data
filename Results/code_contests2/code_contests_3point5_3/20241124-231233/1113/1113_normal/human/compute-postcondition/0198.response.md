Output State: 
If `T` is 0 or negative, `res` remains an empty list.
If `T` is a positive integer:
- `res` will contain modified versions of the input rows where '9' is replaced by '1' or an exact copy of the original row.
- If `row` is an empty iterable object, `res` remains unchanged.
- If `row` is a non-empty iterable object:
  - `nRow` contains the characters of `row` with any '9's replaced by '1'.
  - If '9' is not found in `row`, `nRow` remains the same as `row`.
  - `i` is less than 8 after the inner loop execution.
- `T` remains unchanged after the loop execution.
The function 'write' is called to join the modified rows with '\n' as separator and output the result.
Output State: **`res` contains modified rows, `nRow` contains rows with '9' replaced by '1' if applicable, `i` is less than 8, `T` remains unchanged**
