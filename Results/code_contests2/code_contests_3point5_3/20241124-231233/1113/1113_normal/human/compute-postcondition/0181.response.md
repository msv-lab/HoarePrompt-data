Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with `i`, and `i` is the length of `row`, so `nRow` will have the original value of `nRow` followed by the length of `row`. Since the condition `i` is not equal to '9' is not specified, we assume `i` can be any positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is a part of `row`, `T` remains the same, `row` is not empty, `i` is the length of `row`, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, and `i` is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` is a part of `row`, `T` remains the same, `row` is not empty, `i` is the length of `row`, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
