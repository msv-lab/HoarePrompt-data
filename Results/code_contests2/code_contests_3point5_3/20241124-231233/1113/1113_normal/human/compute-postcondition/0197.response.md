Output State: 
If `T` is 0 or negative, the outer loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty list. 
If `T` is a positive integer:
- After the loop executes, `res` will contain modified versions of the input rows where '9' is replaced by '1' or an exact copy of the original row.
- If `row` is an empty iterable object, the inner loop does not execute, and `res` remains unchanged.
- If `row` is a non-empty iterable object:
  - After the loop executes, `nRow` contains the characters of `row` with any '9's replaced by '1'.
  - If '9' is not found in `row`, `nRow` remains the same as `row`.
  - `i` is less than 8 after the inner loop execution.
- `T` remains unchanged after the loop execution.
