Functionality: **The function `func` processes `t` test cases where each case consists of 9 lines with 9 characters each. It replaces any occurrence of '9' with '1' in the input rows. The function does not return any value; it processes the test cases as specified. Potential edge cases include handling situations where the input rows are empty or do not contain the character '9'.**
