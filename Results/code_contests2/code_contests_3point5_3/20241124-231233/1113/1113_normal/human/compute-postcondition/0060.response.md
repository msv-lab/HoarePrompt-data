Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is updated to the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `res` is appended with `nRow`, `nRow` contains the modified string based on the value of the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`; otherwise, `i` is appended to `nRow`. This covers all potential cases and edge scenarios of the program.***
