Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. The constraints state that `nRow` either ends with '2' or contains the value of `i + 1`, and `row` is a non-empty iterable object with more elements left to iterate through. After concatenation, the new value of `nRow` may end with '2' or contain `i + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` ends with '2' or contains the value of `i + 1`, `row` is a non-empty iterable object with more elements left to iterate through.
Output State: **`nRow` ends with '2' or contains the value of `i + 1`, `row` is a non-empty iterable object with more elements left to iterate through**
