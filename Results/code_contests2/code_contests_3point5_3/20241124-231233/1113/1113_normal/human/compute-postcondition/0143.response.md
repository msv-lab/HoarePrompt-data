According to the code, the loop can execute if there are characters left in the `row` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `T` remains the same, `row` has at least one character with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is 1, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, `i` is 0, `nRow` is not an empty string. To execute the loop one more time, the next character in the `row` should be considered. If the next character is '9', it should be replaced by '1' in `nRow`. If the next character is not '9', it should be appended as it is to `nRow`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`T` remains the same, `row` has at least one character with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is 1, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, `i` is 0, `nRow` is not an empty string**
