According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, or an empty string if `row` is empty. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, or an empty string if `row` is empty, `i` is 9**
