Example Answer: 
The `nRow` variable is appended to the `res` list. The `nRow` variable contains the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'. If there are no '9' characters in `row`, `nRow` will be an exact copy of `row`. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, or an empty string if `row` is empty.
Output State: **`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, or an empty string if `row` is empty**
