According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of the `row` string. If `i` is less than the length of `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace. If `i` is '9', `nRow` has '9' replaced by '1' concatenated with '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 10, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace**
