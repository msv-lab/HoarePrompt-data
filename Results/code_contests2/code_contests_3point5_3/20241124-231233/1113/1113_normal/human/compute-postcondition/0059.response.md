Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with `i`, where `i` is the index of the next character in `row`. The exact values of `nRow`, `i`, and `row` are not provided, so the output state is: `res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is updated to the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `res` is appended with `nRow`, `nRow` contains the modified string based on the value of the next character in `row` concatenated with `i`.
Output State: **`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is updated to the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `res` is appended with `nRow`, `nRow` contains the modified string based on the value of the next character in `row` concatenated with `i`**
