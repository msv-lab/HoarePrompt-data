According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the `row` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is modified based on whether `i` is equal to 9 or not, `T` remains unchanged, `row` is not empty, and `i` is the length of `row` + 2. To adjust the states for the next iteration, the following modifications need to be made:
- If `i` is equal to 9, then '1' must be added to `nRow` for the next iteration.
- If `i` is not equal to 9, then the value of `i+1` must be appended to `nRow`.
- `T` remains unchanged.
- `row` should still not be empty.
- `i` for the next iteration will be the length of `row` + 1.

State: **`nRow` is a modified version of `row` based on the value of `i` (either '1' added or `i+1` appended), `T` remains unchanged, `row` is not empty, and `i` is the length of `row` + 1**
