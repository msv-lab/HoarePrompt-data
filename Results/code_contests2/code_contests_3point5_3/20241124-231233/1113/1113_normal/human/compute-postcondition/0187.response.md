According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `T` remains unchanged, `row` is not empty, and `i` is the length of `row` + 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `nRow` needs to be updated accordingly based on the new value of `i`.
State: **`nRow` is a part of `row` with either '1' added to it when `i` is equal to '9', or `nRow` is appended with the value of `i+1`. `T` remains unchanged, `row` is not empty, and `i` is the length of `row` + 2**
