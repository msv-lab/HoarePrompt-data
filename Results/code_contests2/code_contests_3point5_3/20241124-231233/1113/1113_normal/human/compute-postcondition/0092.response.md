Example Answer:
The input is stripped and stored in the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, after the loop executes, `nRow` will contain all characters of `row` but replacing any occurrences of '9' with '1'. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string, and `i` is less than 8.
Output State: **If `row` is not empty, after the loop executes, `nRow` will contain all characters of `row` but replacing any occurrences of '9' with '1'. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string, `i` is less than 8**
