Postcondition: ***`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 0, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `res` is appended with `nRow`, `nRow` is an empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', then the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`. After the execution, `nRow` will contain the modified string based on the value of `i` in each case.***
