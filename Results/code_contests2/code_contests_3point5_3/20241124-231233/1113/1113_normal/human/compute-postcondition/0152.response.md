Output State: **If `row` contains at least one character, the loop will replace '9' with '1' and append the modified characters to `nRow`. The loop will execute for each character in `row`. After the loop execution, `T` remains the same, `row` has '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the length of `row`, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, `nRow` contains the modified `row`. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `nRow` remains an empty string.**
