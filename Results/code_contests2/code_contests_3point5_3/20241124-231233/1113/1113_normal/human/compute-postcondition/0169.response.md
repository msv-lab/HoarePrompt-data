Example Answer: 
`nRow` is updated by concatenating the previous value of `nRow` with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the length of `row` plus 2, so the value of `nRow` after the update will be the previous `nRow` concatenated with the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` remains the same, `row` has at least one element, `i` is the length of `row` plus 2, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, and `nRow` is updated according to the specified conditions.
Output State: **`T` remains the same, `row` has at least one element, `i` is the length of `row` plus 2, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, and `nRow` is updated by concatenating the previous value with the value of `i`.**
