According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 11 which means the loop has already executed more than 9 times. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than 9 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`res` contains `nRow` with '9' replaced by '1' or an exact copy of `row`, `i` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `res` is appended with `nRow`**
