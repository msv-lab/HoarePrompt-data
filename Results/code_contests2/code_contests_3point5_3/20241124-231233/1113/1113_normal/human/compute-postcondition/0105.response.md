Example Answer: 
`nRow` is concatenated with '1', so if `nRow` ends with '2', it will now end with '21'. If `nRow` contains the value of `i + 1`, it will now contain the value of `i + 11`. The `row` remains unaffected as it is a separate variable. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` ends with '21' or contains the value of `i + 11`, `row` is a non-empty iterable object with more elements left to iterate through.
Output State: **`nRow` ends with '21' or contains the value of `i + 11`, `row` is a non-empty iterable object with more elements left to iterate through**
