Output State: **After the loop executes, `nRow` will be the modified version of `row` where '9' is replaced by '1' if present, `T` remains unchanged, `row` is not empty, and `i` is the length of `row`. If `row` is empty, the loop will not execute and `nRow` will remain empty, `T` will stay the same, `row` will be empty, and `i` will be 0.**
