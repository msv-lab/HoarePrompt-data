According to the code, the loop will execute for i ranging from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, if `row` is not empty, `nRow` will contain all characters of `row` but replacing any occurrences of '9' with '1'. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **If `row` is not empty, after the loop executes, `nRow` will contain all characters of `row` but replacing any occurrences of '9' with '1'. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string, i is less than 8**
