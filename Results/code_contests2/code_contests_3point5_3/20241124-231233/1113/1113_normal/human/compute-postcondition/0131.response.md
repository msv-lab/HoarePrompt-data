According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 8. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty iterable object with no more elements left to iterate through, `nRow` is the result of replacing any '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is less than 8, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, and `row` is a valid string. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Since `i` is currently less than 8, it needs to be incremented to allow for another iteration. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to be one more than its current value.
- Since `row` is non-empty and there are no more elements left to iterate through, it implies that the loop will not execute again. Therefore, `row` can be considered as an empty string for the next iteration.
- Since the loop will not execute again, `nRow` does not need to be adjusted.
- Since the loop will not execute again, `res` list will remain the same as it was after the last iteration.

State: **`row` is an empty string, `nRow` remains the same as before, `i` is one more than its previous value, `res` list remains the same as before**
