Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a part of `row` with '1' added to it when `i` is equal to '9', or `nRow` is appended with the value of `i+1`. `T` remains unchanged, `row` is not empty, and `i` is the length of `row` + 2. The final state of the program after the if else block execution includes all possible scenarios: if `i` is '9', '1' is added to `nRow`; if `i` is not '9', the value of `i+1` is appended to `nRow`. The postcondition ensures that all edge cases are covered, maintaining the integrity of the variables and their relationships.***
