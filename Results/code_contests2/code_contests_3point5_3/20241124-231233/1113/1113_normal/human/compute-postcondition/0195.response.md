Output State: **If row is not empty, after the loop executes, `res` will contain a list of modified rows where '9's are replaced by '1's. `T` remains unchanged, `i` is the length of the last `row` processed, and `nRow` contains the modified version of `row`. If row is empty, the loop does not execute, `T` remains the same, `row` is empty, `i` is 0, and `res` remains the same.**
