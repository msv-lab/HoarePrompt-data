Output State: **After the loop executes, `row` is a non-empty iterable object with no more elements left to iterate through, `nRow` is the result of replacing any '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is less than 8, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, and `row` is a valid string. If there are no '9's in `row`, `nRow` remains the same as `row`. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute and `res` list is empty as well.**
