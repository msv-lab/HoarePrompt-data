Postcondition: ***`res` is an empty list, `i` represents the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string. If '9' is found in the remaining part of `row`, `nRow` contains all characters of `row` concatenated together followed by '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions mentioned in the program fragment.***
