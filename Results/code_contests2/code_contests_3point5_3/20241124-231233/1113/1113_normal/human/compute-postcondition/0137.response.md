According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `row` and the variable `i`. If `row` has at least one character, the loop can execute. The condition for `i` to be less than 8 is already met. Before the loop starts, '9's are replaced by '1's in the input string `row`, so it needs to be adjusted that '9's are replaced by '1's and `i` is now 1. Also, the list `res` contains `nRow` appended, so `nRow` needs to be updated as well to not be empty.
State: **`T` is the same, `row` has at least one character with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is 1, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, `i` is 0, `nRow` is not an empty string**
