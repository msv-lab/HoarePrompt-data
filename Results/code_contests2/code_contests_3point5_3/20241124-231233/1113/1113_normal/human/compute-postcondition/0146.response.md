Postcondition: ***`T` remains the same, `row` has at least one character with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is 1, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, `i` is 0, `nRow` is not an empty string. If `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the string representation of `i` is concatenated to `nRow`.***
