Output State: 
If `row` is an empty iterable object, the loop does not execute, and `res` list remains empty. 
If `row` is a non-empty iterable object:
- After the loop executes, `nRow` contains the characters of `row` with any '9's replaced by '1'.
- If '9' is not found in `row`, `nRow` remains the same as `row`.
- `i` is less than 8 after the loop execution.
- The `res` list contains `nRow` appended after each iteration.
