According to the code, the loop can execute 9 times. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` will be appended to `res`. If `row` is not empty, `nRow` will be the modified version of `row` where '9' is replaced by '1' if present, `T` remains unchanged, and `i` is the length of `row`. If `row` is empty, `nRow` will not be appended to `res`, `T` will stay the same, `row` will be empty, and `i` will be 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`nRow` is appended to `res`, `row` is not empty (containing '9'), `T` remains unchanged, `i` is the length of `row`**
