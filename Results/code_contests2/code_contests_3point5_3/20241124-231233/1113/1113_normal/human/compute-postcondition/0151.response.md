According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T` and `row` remain the same throughout, `i` is 2, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, `nRow` is not an empty string. For the loop to execute one more time, the `row` must have more elements. Since `i` is 2 and `nRow` is not empty, the next element in `row` will determine if the loop can execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
State: **`T` and `row` remain the same throughout, `i` is 2, `res` list contains `nRow` appended, `nRow` is not an empty string**
