Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not align with the problem description. The problem states that we need to change at most 9 elements in the Sudoku grid to make it an anti-sudoku. However, the code provided simply replaces any occurrence of '9' with '1' in the input rows without considering the constraints of an anti-sudoku. This means that the code does not generate the correct output for the given problem description. The output hints do not provide any information that aligns with the requirements of an anti-sudoku, further confirming that the code is incorrect.
