You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given a correct solution of the sudoku puzzle. If you don't know what is the sudoku, you can read about it [here](http://tiny.cc/636xmz).

The picture showing the correct sudoku solution:

<image>

Blocks are bordered with bold black color.

Your task is to change at most 9 elements of this field (i.e. choose some 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 9 and change the number at the position (i, j) to any other number in range [1; 9]) to make it anti-sudoku. The anti-sudoku is the 9 × 9 field, in which:

  * Any number in this field is in range [1; 9]; 
  * each row contains at least two equal elements; 
  * each column contains at least two equal elements; 
  * each 3 × 3 block (you can read what is the block in the link above) contains at least two equal elements. 



It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of 9 lines, each line consists of 9 characters from 1 to 9 without any whitespaces — the correct solution of the sudoku puzzle.

Output

For each test case, print the answer — the initial field with at most 9 changed elements so that the obtained field is anti-sudoku. If there are several solutions, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.
