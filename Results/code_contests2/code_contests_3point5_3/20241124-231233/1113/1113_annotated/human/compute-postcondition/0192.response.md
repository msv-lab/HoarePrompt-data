Output State: **After the loop executes, `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is 9, `T` is greater than 1, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is appended to `res`, `row` still has more elements left to iterate over. The loop will replace all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` and store the modified row in `nRow`.**
