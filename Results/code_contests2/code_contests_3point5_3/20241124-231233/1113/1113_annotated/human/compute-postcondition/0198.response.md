Output State: After the loop executes, `maxint` remains positive infinity. If `T` is 0 or negative, `res` is an empty list. If `T` is greater than 0, `res` contains all modified rows, `i` is the last value processed in the row, `nRow` is the modified row after processing all elements, and `t` is the total number of iterations completed. The function `write('\n'.join(res))` is called to output the modified rows.
