For the loop to execute, the variable `row` needs to have at least one element since the loop iterates over each element in `row`. At the start of the loop, `i` should be the first element of `row`. 
State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the first element of `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input string with at least 1 element, `nRow` is an empty string**
