Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next value in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next value of `i` in `row`, `T` is greater than 1, `row` still has more elements left to iterate over. If `i` is '9', `nRow` has '1' appended to it. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
