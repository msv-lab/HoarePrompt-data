According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is the next element in `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` appends '11'. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` appends '19'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `row` should have more elements, and the `nRow` should be the next element in `row`.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is the next element in `row`**.
