According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`, which is the input string after stripping whitespace. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the `nRow` is an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty. Additionally, since the loop iterates over each character in `row`, the value of `i` should be set to the first index of `row`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are: `nRow` is `row`, `i` is the index of the first character in `row`.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the first character in `row`, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is `row`**
