Example Answer:
At this point, the value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the next value in `row`, which is represented by `i`. If `i` is '9', then '1' is concatenated to `nRow`, otherwise, `i` is concatenated to `nRow`. Since the initial state is `res` is an empty string and `i` is the next value in `row`, after the execution, the output state will be:
Output State: **`res` is an empty string, `i` is the next value in `row`, `row` has more values to iterate through, `nRow` is updated according to the conditions**
