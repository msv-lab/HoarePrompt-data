Example Answer: 
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous values of `nRow` and `i` are unknown, so the output state is: `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, `nRow` have their initial values, and `nRow` is incremented by `i`.
Output State: **`maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, `nRow` have their initial values, `nRow` is incremented by `i`**
