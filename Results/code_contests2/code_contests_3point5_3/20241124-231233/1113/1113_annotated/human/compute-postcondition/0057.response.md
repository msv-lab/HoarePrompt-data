According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If there are more characters left in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` contains the updated string with at least one '9' character, `res` contains the appended value of `nRow` if '9' is equal to `i`, otherwise `res` contains the updated value after appending `i`, and `row` is not empty. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the `row` variable should still have characters left for iteration. Additionally, the `nRow` should be updated based on the conditions mentioned in the postcondition. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`nRow` contains the updated string with at least one '9' character, `res` contains the updated value after the appending operation, `row` still has characters left for iteration**
