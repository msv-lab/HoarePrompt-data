Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it. The previous values of `nRow` and `i` are known, so after execution, the new value of `nRow` will be the sum of the previous `nRow` and `i`. The `row` list remains unaffected. 
Output State: **`res` is a list containing updated `nRow`, `i` is the next value in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the new `i`, `row` is updated after removing the processed element**
