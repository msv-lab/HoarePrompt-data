According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is the last value in `row` plus 1, `nRow` contains the concatenation of '1' for each '9' found in `row` and the original values of `row` for non-'9' elements and '1', `row` is the input string after stripping.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `res` should now contain the updated `nRow` based on the new `i`.
- `i` should be the next element in `row`.
- `nRow` should be updated according to the new `i`. If the new `i` is '9', then '1' should be appended to `nRow`. If the new `i` is not '9', then `nRow` should be incremented by the value of the new `i`.
- `row` should be updated to remove the element that has already been processed.

State: **`res` is a list containing updated `nRow`, `i` is the next value in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the new `i`, `row` is updated after removing the processed element**
