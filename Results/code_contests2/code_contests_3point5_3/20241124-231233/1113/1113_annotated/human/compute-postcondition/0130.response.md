Example Answer:
The value `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. Depending on the initial state, there are three possible scenarios:
1. If `row` is empty, then `res` contains the initial values of `nRow`, `i`, and `row`.
2. If `row` contains only '9's, then `res` contains a string of '1's with the length of `row`.
3. If `row` contains no '9's, then `res` contains the original `row`.

Output State: **Depends on the initial state of `row`**
