Output State: **The loop updates each character in the input row, replacing '9' with '1' if encountered, and appends the modified row to the list `res`. After the loop executes, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all modified rows, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, and `t` is 0. If no '9' characters are present in the input rows, the appended `nRow` will be an empty string. If the loop doesn't execute, `res` will be an empty list.**
