According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `row`. 

Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `res` is a list containing `nRow`, 
- `i` is the last value in `row` plus 1, 
- `nRow` contains the concatenation of '1' for each '9' found in `row` and the original values of `row` for non-'9' elements, 
- `row` is the input string after stripping, 
- `nRow` is an empty string

State: **`res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is the last value in `row` plus 1, `nRow` contains the concatenation of '1' for each '9' found in `row` and the original values of `row` for non-'9' elements, `row` is the input string after stripping, `nRow` is an empty string**
