Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the stripped input value. The values of `maxint`, `res`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `maxint` is a specific value, `res` contains some initial rows, `T` is a positive value, `t` is 1, `row` contains the stripped input value.
Output State: **`maxint` is a specific value, `res` contains some initial rows, `T` is a positive value, `t` is 1, `row` contains the stripped input value**
