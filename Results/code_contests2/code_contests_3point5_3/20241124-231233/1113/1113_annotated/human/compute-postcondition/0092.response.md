Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the stripped input from the user. The value of `res` is not mentioned, so it remains unknown. The value of `i` is 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` now contains the value of `nRow` after processing all elements in `row`, `i` is 9.
Output State: **`res` now contains the value of `nRow` after processing all elements in `row`, `i` is 9**
