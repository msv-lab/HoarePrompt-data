Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next value in `row` to be iterated over, `T` is greater than 1, `row` still has more elements left to iterate over. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`.***
