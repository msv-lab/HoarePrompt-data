Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is 9, `T` is greater than 1, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is appended to `res`, `row` still has more elements left to iterate over. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', then the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`.***
