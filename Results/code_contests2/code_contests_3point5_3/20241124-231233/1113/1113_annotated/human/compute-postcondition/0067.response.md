Example Answer:
Initially, the loop iterates through all characters in `row`. If '9' is encountered in `nRow`, '1' is appended to `nRow`, and the updated value is stored in `res`. If '9' is not found, the current character `i` is appended to `nRow`, and `res` will contain the updated value of `nRow` after the loop execution.
Output State: **`nRow` contains the updated string with possible '1' appended if '9' is encountered. `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`. The loop will iterate through all characters in `row`.**
