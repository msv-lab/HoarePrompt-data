Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the last value processed in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the condition where if the last value processed in `row` is '9', it is replaced with '1' in `nRow`, otherwise `nRow` retains the value of `i`, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is assigned the stripped input. The postcondition covers all possible cases including the scenario where the last value processed in `row` is '9' and where it is not, ensuring the consistency of variable values and relationships after the if else block executes.***
