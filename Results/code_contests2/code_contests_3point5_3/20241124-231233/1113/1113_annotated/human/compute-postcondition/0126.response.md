Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to `nRow`, which already contains updated values based on the previous `i`. If the current value of `i` is '9', '1' will be appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the current value of `i` will be appended to `nRow`. In both cases, `i` is the next value in `row` and `row` must have more elements remaining. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing updated `nRow` based on the value of `i`. 
Output State: **`res` is a list containing updated `nRow` based on the value of `i`**
