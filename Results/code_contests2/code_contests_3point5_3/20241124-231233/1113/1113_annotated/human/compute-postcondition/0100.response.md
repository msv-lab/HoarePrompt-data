According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row` iterable object. If there are more values in `row`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is an empty string, `i` is the first value in `row`, `row` is an iterable object. If the first value in `row` is '9', `nRow` is '91'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by adding `i`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have more values to iterate through and `i` should be the next value in `row`. 
State: **`res` is an empty string, `i` is the next value in `row`, `row` has more values to iterate through. If the next value in `row` is '9', `nRow` is '91'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by adding the next value in `row`.**
