According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are more values to iterate through in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is an empty string, `i` is the next value in `row`, and `row` still has more values to iterate through. The conditions for updating `nRow` are based on the value of `i` and the next value in `row`. 

If the next value in `row` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '91', otherwise `nRow` is updated by adding the next value in `row`. Additionally, in the if part, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. In the else part, if `i` is not '9', `nRow` is concatenated with `i`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
State: **`res` is an empty string, `i` is the next value in `row`, `row` has more values to iterate through. If the next value in `row` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '91', otherwise `nRow` is updated by adding the next value in `row`. In the if part, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. In the else part, if `i` is not '9', `nRow` is concatenated with `i`.**
