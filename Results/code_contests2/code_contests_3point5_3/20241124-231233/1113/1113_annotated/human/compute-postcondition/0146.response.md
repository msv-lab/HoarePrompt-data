Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the last value processed in `row`, `nRow` is updated by appending '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` retains the value of `i`, `T` is greater than 1, and `row` is assigned the stripped input. In addition, if `i` is '9', `nRow` has '1' appended to it.***
