Example Answer:
After executing the given code snippet, `nRow` is appended to the `res` list. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the last value processed in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions of the loop, `T` is greater than 1, `row` still has more elements left to iterate over, and `nRow` is appended to `res`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the last value processed in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions of the loop, `T` is greater than 1, `row` still has more elements left to iterate over, and `nRow` is appended to `res`**
