According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nRow` is an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty. Additionally, since `i` is the last value processed in `row`, it should be updated to be the last value in the current `row`. 
State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the last value processed in `row`, `nRow` is an empty string, `T` is greater than 1, `i` is the last value in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input**
