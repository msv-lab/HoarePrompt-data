Output State: **`res` is an empty string, `i` is the next value in `row`, `row` has more values to iterate through. If the next value in `row` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '91', otherwise `nRow` is updated by adding the next value in `row`. In the if part, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. In the else part, if `i` is not '9', `nRow` is concatenated with `i`. `nRow` is concatenated with '1'**
