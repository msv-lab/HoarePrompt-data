Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next value in `row` to be iterated over, `T` is greater than 1, `row` still has more elements left to iterate over. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated by appending '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i`. In both cases, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i` if `i` is not '9'.***
