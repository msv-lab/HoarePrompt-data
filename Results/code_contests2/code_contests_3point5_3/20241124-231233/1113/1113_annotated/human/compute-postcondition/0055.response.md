Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with `i`, where `i` is not equal to '9'. The value of `nRow` is updated with an additional character. The value of `res` will also be updated with the newly appended `i`. Since `i` is not equal to '9', the output state is: `nRow` contains the updated string with at least one '9' character and the appended `i`, `res` contains the updated value after appending `i`, `row` is not empty, `i` is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` contains the updated string with at least one '9' character and the appended `i`, `res` contains the updated value after appending `i`, `row` is not empty, `i` is not equal to '9'**
