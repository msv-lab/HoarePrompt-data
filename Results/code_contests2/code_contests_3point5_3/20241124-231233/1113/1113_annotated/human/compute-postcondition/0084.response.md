According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `row`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, `nRow` have their initial values. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` needs to have more elements.
State: **`maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, `nRow` have their initial values. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by `i`, and `row` has more elements**
