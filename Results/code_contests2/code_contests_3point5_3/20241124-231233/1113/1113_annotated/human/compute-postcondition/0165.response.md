Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous values of `nRow` and `i` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next value in `row` to be iterated over, `T` is greater than 1, `row` still has more elements left to iterate over, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions met in the if-else statement and `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next value in `row` to be iterated over, `T` is greater than 1, `row` still has more elements left to iterate over, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions met in the if-else statement and `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`**
