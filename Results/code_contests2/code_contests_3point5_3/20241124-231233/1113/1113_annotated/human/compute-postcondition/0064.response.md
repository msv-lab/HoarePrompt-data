Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `nRow` contains the updated string where if `i` is '9', '1' is appended, otherwise, the value of `i` is appended. `res` contains the updated value after the appending operation. `row` still has characters left for iteration. The edge cases are covered such that if '9' is appended, '1' is added to `nRow`, else `i` is directly appended to `nRow`. All variables maintain their initial relationships and values as described in the precondition.***
