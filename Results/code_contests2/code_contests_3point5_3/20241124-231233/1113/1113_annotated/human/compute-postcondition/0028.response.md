According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 9**
