According to the code, the loop execution depends on the elements present in the `row` list. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is the next element in `row` if available, else `nRow` is not defined. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` appends '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` appends `i`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- If the loop is to execute one more time, it means that there is another element in the `row` list to iterate over. Therefore, `nRow` should be the next element in the `row` list.
- If `nRow` is not defined, it implies that the end of the `row` list has been reached, which means the loop should not execute one more time. So, `nRow` should be defined as the next element in the `row` list.

Final Adjusted State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is the next element in `row`, `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` appends '1'.**
