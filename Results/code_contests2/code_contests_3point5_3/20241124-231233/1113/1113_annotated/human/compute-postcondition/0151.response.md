According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements left in the `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next value in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next value of `i` in `row`, `T` is greater than 1, and `row` still has more elements left to iterate over. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If the next value of `i` in `row` is '9', then `nRow` should have '1' appended to it.
2. If the next value of `i` in `row` is not '9', then `nRow` should be increased by the value of `i`.

State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next value in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next value of `i` in `row`, `T` is greater than 1, `row` still has more elements left to iterate over.**
