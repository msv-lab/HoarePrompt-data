According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements remaining in the `row`. If there are more elements remaining in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is a list containing updated `nRow` based on the value of `i`, `i` is the next value in `row`, and `row` must have more elements remaining. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `row` must have at least one more element remaining. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`res` is a list containing updated `nRow` based on the value of `i`, `i` is the next value in `row`, and `row` must have at least one more element remaining**
