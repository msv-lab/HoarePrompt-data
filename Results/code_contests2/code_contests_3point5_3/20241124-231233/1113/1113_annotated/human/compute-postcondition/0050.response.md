Example Answer:
Initially, `nRow` is an empty string. After executing the code snippet, `nRow` remains an empty string as there is no assignment or operation performed on it. The variables `nRow` and `res` are not affected by the code snippet.
Output State: **If '9' character is present in `nRow`, `nRow` contains the updated string with at least one '9' character, `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`**
