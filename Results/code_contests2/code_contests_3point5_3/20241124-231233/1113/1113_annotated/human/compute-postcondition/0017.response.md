According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is 0. If the first element of `row` is '9', `nRow` is '1'. If the first element of `row` is not '9', `nRow` is equal to the first element of `row`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is the next element in `row` if available, else `nRow` is not defined**
