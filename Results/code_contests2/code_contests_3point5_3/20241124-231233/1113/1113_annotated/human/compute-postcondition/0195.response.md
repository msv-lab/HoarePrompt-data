Output State: **After the loop executes, `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is 9, `nRow` is the row after processing all elements of `row`, `T` is greater than 1. If the input row does not contain any '9' values, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain unchanged.**
