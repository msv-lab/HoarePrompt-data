Example Answer: 
`nRow` is appended with '1' irrespective of the previous values. The last value processed in `row` is not specified, so we cannot determine if it was '9' or not. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the last value processed in `row`, `nRow` is updated by appending '1', `T` is greater than 1, `row` is assigned the stripped input.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the last value processed in `row`, `nRow` is updated by appending '1', `T` is greater than 1, `row` is assigned the stripped input**
