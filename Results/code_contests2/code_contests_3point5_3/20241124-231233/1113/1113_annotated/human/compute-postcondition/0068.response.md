According to the code, the loop will iterate through all characters in `row` as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` contains the updated string with possible '1' appended if '9' is encountered, `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`. Since the loop will execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted so that `i` is less than 9. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
State: **`nRow` contains the updated string with possible '1' appended if '9' is encountered, `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`, `i` is 9**
