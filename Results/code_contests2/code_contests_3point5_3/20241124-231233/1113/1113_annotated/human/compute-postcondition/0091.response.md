According to the code, the loop can execute 9 times as it iterates over the range of 9. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the value of `nRow`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 9. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` now contains the value of `nRow` after processing all elements in `row`, `i` is 9**
