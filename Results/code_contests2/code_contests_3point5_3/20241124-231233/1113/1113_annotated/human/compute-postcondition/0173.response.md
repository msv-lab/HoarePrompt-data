Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next value processed in `row`, `T` is greater than 1, `row` still has more elements left to iterate over, `nRow` is appended to `res`, `row` is assigned the stripped input value, `nRow` is an empty string. If the value of `i` is '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is concatenated with `i`. Overall, after the execution of the if-else block, `nRow` will contain the updated values based on the conditions met in the if-else statement. If `row` is an empty string or does not contain any '9' values, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain unchanged.**
