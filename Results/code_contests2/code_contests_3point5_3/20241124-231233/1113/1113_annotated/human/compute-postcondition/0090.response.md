Example Answer: 
The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The state of `nRow` depends on the processing of elements in `row` as described above. If `row` is not empty, the loop will iterate through each element and modify `nRow` accordingly. If `row` is empty, `nRow` will remain an empty string. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` now contains the value of `nRow` after processing all elements in `row`.
Output State: **`res` now contains the value of `nRow` after processing all elements in `row`**
