Since the loop iterates over the range of 9, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than 9. No other states need adjustment as per the provided information.

State: **Depends on the initial state of `row`, `i` is less than 9**
