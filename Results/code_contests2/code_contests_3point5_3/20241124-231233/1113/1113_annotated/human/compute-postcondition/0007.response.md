According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `T`. If `T` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity does not affect the loop execution. However, `res` being an empty list also does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `T` is greater than or equal to 0 and `t` is 0.
State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is 0**
