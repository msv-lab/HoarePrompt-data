Since the loop is iterating over the range of 9, it will execute for sure. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to update the values as follows:
State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the last value processed in `row`, `nRow` is the modified row after processing all elements in `row`, `T` is greater than 1, `i` is 8**
