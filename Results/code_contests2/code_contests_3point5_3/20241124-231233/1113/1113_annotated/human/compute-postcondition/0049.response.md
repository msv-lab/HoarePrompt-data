Example Answer:
The input string is stripped and assigned to the variable `row`. The previous values of `nRow` and `res` are not provided, but if '9' character is present in `nRow`, then `nRow` contains the updated string with at least one '9' character, and `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`. The value of `row` will depend on the user input.
Output State: **If '9' character is present in `nRow`, `nRow` contains the updated string with at least one '9' character, `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`**
