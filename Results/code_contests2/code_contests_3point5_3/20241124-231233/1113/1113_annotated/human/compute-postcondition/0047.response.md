Example Answer:
Since the code snippet provided is appending `nRow` to the list `res`, the value of `nRow` will be added to the list `res`. The content of `nRow` depends on the original `row` and how '9' characters were replaced with '1'. If no '9' characters were present in `row`, then `nRow` remains an empty string. Therefore, the Output State is: If no '9' characters were present, `nRow` is an empty string; otherwise, `nRow` contains the updated string. `res` will now contain the appended value of `nRow`.
Output State: **If no '9' characters were present, `nRow` is an empty string; otherwise, `nRow` contains the updated string, `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`**
