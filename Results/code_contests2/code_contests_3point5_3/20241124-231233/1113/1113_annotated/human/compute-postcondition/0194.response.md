According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`. If `i` is less than 9, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9, which means the loop cannot execute again. However, based on the other conditions specified, the loop should execute one more time.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` needs to be adjusted to 10 to allow for one more iteration.
2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **Output State: After the loop executes, `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is 10, `T` is greater than 1, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is appended to `res`, `row` still has more elements left to iterate over, and `nRow` is appended to `res`**
