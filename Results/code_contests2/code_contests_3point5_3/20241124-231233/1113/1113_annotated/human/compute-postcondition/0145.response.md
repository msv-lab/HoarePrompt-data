Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous values of the variables are not mentioned, so the output state is: `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the last value processed in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the condition where if the last value processed in `row` is '9', it is replaced with '1' in `nRow`, otherwise `nRow` retains the value of `i`, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is assigned the stripped input, and `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the last value processed in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the condition where if the last value processed in `row` is '9', it is replaced with '1' in `nRow`, otherwise `nRow` retains the value of `i`, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is assigned the stripped input, and `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`**
