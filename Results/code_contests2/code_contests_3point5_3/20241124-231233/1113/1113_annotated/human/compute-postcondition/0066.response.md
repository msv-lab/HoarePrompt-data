Output State: If '9' character is present in `nRow`, the loop will execute and update `nRow` by appending '1' if the character '9' is encountered. `res` will contain the appended value of `nRow`. If '9' character is not present in `nRow`, the loop will still execute and update `nRow` by appending the current character `i`. The final `res` will contain the updated value of `nRow`. The loop will always execute as long as there are characters left in `row` for iteration. The edge cases are handled in both branches of the if-else block, ensuring the integrity of string manipulation.
Output State after the loop executes: `nRow` contains the updated string with possible '1' appended if '9' is encountered. `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`. The loop will iterate through all characters in `row`.
