According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `t` and `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all modified rows, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, and `t` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all modified rows, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, and `t` is 1**.
