Output State: **If `row` is an empty iterable, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, for each element `i` in `row`, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is concatenated with `i`. After the loop completes, `res` remains an empty string, `i` is the last value in `row`, and `nRow` contains the concatenation of '1' for each '9' found in `row` and the original values of `row` for non-'9' elements.**
