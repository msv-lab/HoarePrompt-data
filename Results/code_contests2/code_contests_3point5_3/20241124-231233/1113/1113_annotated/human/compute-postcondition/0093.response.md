Example Answer:
Since `nRow` is assigned an empty string, the value of `res` which contains the value of `nRow` after processing all elements in `row` will also be an empty string. The value of `i` remains 9 and is not affected by this assignment.
Output State: **`res` is an empty string, `i` is 9**
