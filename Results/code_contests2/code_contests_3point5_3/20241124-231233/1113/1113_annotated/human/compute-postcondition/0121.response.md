Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to the end. The previous value of `nRow` is known to be a list containing updated `nRow`, so after execution, the updated `nRow` will contain the previous values along with '1' added. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing updated `nRow` with '1', `i` is the next value in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the new `i`, `row` is updated after removing the processed element.
Output State: **`res` is a list containing updated `nRow` with '1', `i` is the next value in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the new `i`, `row` is updated after removing the processed element**
