According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times in total. At the end of the last iteration, if no '9' characters were present, `nRow` is an empty string; otherwise, `nRow` contains the updated string, `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `nRow` needs to contain the updated string with at least one '9' character.
State: **If '9' character is present in `nRow`, `nRow` contains the updated string with at least one '9' character, `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`**
