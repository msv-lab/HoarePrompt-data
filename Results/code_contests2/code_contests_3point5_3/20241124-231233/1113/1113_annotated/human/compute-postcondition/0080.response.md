According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, `nRow` have their initial values. If `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` in the `row` should be such that if `i` is '9', then '1' should be appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', then the value of `i` should be appended to `nRow`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `row` should contain a value where if `i` is '9', then '1' should be appended to `nRow`, or if `i` is not '9', the value of `i` should be appended to `nRow`.

State: **`maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, `nRow` have their initial values**.
