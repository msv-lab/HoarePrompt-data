Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to it. The value of `nRow` changes accordingly. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next value in `row` to be iterated over, `T` is greater than 1, `row` still has more elements left to iterate over, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions met in the if-else statement.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next value in `row` to be iterated over, `T` is greater than 1, `row` still has more elements left to iterate over, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions met in the if-else statement**
