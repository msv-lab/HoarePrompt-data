Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is the last value in `row` plus 1, `nRow` contains the concatenation of '1' for each '9' found in `row` and the original values of `row` for non-'9' elements and '1', `row` is the input string after stripping. If `i` is '9', `nRow` has '1' appended to it. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.***
