According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `row` variable to iterate over. Before the loop starts, the `row` variable needs to contain elements. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:

State: **`maxint` is a specific value, `res` contains some initial rows, `T` is a positive value, `t` is 1, `row` contains elements to iterate over, `nRow` is an empty string**
