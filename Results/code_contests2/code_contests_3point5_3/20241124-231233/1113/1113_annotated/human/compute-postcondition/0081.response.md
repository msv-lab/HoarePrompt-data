Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1', so the value of `nRow` changes depending on its previous value. If `nRow` was originally '3', it will become '31'. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row` have their initial values, `nRow` is concatenated with '1'.
Output State: **`maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row` have their initial values, `nRow` is concatenated with '1'**
