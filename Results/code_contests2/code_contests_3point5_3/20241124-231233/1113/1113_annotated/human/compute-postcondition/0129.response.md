Output State: 
The loop processes each element in `row` and updates `nRow` accordingly. If the element `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`, otherwise, `i` is appended to `nRow`. After the loop finishes, `res` will contain the final `nRow` and `i` will be the last value in `row` plus 1. If `row` is an empty string, the loop won't execute, and `res` will contain the initial values of `nRow`, `i`, and `row`.
If `row` contains only '9' elements, the loop will execute `len(row)` times, and `nRow` will have '1' appended for each '9', resulting in a string of '1's with the length of `row`. 
If `row` contains no '9' elements, the loop will execute `len(row)` times, and `nRow` will be equal to `row`. 

Output State: **`res` contains the final `nRow`, `i` is the last value in `row` plus 1. If `row` is empty, `res` contains the initial values of `nRow`, `i`, and `row`. If `row` contains only '9's, `res` contains a string of '1's with the length of `row`. If `row` contains no '9's, `res` contains the original `row`**
