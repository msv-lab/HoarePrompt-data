According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the `row` variable for iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` contains the updated string, `res` contains the updated value after appending, and `row` still has characters left for iteration. The edge cases are covered, so if '9' is appended, '1' is added to `nRow`, otherwise, the value of `i` is appended. All variables maintain their initial relationships and values as described in the precondition. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`nRow` contains the updated string, `res` contains the updated value after appending, `row` still has characters left for iteration**
