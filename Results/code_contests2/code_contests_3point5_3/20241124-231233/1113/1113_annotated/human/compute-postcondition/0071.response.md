According to the code, the loop will execute for i ranging from 0 to 8 inclusive. Therefore, the loop will execute regardless of the initial state. However, if you want to adjust the states for the loop to execute, you can set `maxint` to a specific value, `res` to contain some initial rows, `T` to be a positive value, and `t` to be 1.
State: **`maxint` is a specific value, `res` contains some initial rows, `T` is a positive value, `t` is 1**
