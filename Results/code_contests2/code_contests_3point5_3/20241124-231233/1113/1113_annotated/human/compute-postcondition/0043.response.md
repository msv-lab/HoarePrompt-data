Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`. The previous state of `nRow` is `contains nRow`, and the previous state of `i` is `the index of the next character in row + 1`. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will contain the updated sum. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`nRow` is updated with the sum of its previous value and `i`, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the next character in row + 1, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace, `maxint` is positive infinity**
