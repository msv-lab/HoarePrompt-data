Output State: **If there are elements in `row`, the loop will iterate through each element. If the element `i` is equal to '9', '1' will be appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', the value of `i` will be appended to `nRow`. This process will continue until all elements in `row` are processed. If `row` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string.**
