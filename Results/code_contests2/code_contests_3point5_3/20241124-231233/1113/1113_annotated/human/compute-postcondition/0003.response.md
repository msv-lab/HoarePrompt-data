Example Answer: 
The `write` function is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, indicating that the standard output will now write to the `BytesIO` object. There is no change in the state of the sudoku puzzle solutions. Therefore, the Output State is: The standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object, and the sudoku puzzle solutions remain correct.
Output State: **The standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object, and the sudoku puzzle solutions remain correct**
