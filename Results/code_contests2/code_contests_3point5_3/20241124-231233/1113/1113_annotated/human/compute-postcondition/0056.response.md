Postcondition: ***`nRow` contains the updated string with at least one '9' character. If the character '9' is equal to i, '1' is appended to `nRow` and `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`. If the character '9' is not equal to i, `i` is appended to `nRow` and `res` contains the updated value after appending `i`. Additionally, `row` is not empty in both cases, ensuring the integrity of the string manipulation. This postcondition covers all possible edge cases of the if-else block.***
