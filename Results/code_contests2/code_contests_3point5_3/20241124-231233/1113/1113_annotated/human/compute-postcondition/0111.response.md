According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is the last value in `row`, `nRow` contains the concatenation of '1' for each '9' found in `row` and the original values of `row` for non-'9' elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last value in `row`, and since the loop iterates over `range(9)`, it means `i` will be the last value in `row` plus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is the last value in `row` plus 1, `nRow` contains the concatenation of '1' for each '9' found in `row` and the original values of `row` for non-'9' elements**
