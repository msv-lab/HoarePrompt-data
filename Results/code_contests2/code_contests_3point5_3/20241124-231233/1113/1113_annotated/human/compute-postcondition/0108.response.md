According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` still has more values to iterate through, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is an empty string, `i` is the next value in `row`, `row` has more values to iterate through. If the next value in `row` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '91', otherwise `nRow` is updated by adding the next value in `row`. In the if part, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. In the else part, if `i` is not '9', `nRow` is concatenated with `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next value in `row` should be considered. 

State: **`res` is updated based on the processing of `i` and `nRow`, `i` is the next value in `row`, `row` still has more values to iterate through**
