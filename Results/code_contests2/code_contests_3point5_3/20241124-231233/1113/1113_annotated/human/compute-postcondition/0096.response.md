Example Answer: 
`nRow` is appended with the string '1', so after execution, `nRow` will be '91'. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is an empty string, `i` is the first value in `row` which is '9', `row` is an iterable object with the first value as '9', `nRow` is '91'.
Output State: **`res` is an empty string, `i` is the first value in `row` which is '9', `row` is an iterable object with the first value as '9', `nRow` is '91'**
