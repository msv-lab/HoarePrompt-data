Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given code correctly reads the input for the number of test cases and each sudoku puzzle. It then modifies each row by replacing '9' with '1' as required to make it an anti-sudoku. Finally, it prints the modified sudoku puzzles. The code follows the problem description by ensuring that each row, column, and block contains at least two equal elements, thus making it an anti-sudoku. The logic implemented in the code is correct for all test cases, making the program output the desired results.
