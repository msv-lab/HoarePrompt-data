The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input data for test cases related to a Sudoku puzzle solution. It processes each row of the input, replacing '9' with '1' if present, and appends the modified rows to a list. The function then joins all modified rows with a newline separator and writes the final output. The purpose of the function is to manipulate and display the modified Sudoku puzzle rows.
