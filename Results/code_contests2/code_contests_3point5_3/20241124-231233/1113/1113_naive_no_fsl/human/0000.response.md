Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It simply replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row, which does not guarantee the creation of an anti-sudoku puzzle. The program does not handle the requirements of changing at most 9 elements to create an anti-sudoku puzzle where each row, column, and 3x3 block contains at least two equal elements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide a valid solution to the problem.
