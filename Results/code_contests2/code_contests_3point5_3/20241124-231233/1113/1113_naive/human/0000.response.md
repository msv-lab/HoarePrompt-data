Correctness: **False**

In the provided program, the logic to change at most 9 elements of the sudoku solution to make it anti-sudoku is not implemented correctly. The program simply changes '9' to '1' in each row, which does not guarantee that each row, column, and block will have at least two equal elements.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
1
154873296
386592714
729641835
863725149
975314628
412968357
631457982
598236471
247189563
```

The output should be an anti-sudoku solution, but the program will output:

```
154873196
386592714
729641835
863725149
975314628
412968357
631457982
598236471
247189563
```

This output does not satisfy the conditions of an anti-sudoku, as it only changes '9' to '1' in the first row. Hence, the program is incorrect for this test case.
