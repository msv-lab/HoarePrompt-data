Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the largest possible xor-sum that Grisha can obtain by choosing no more than k candies from the bag. The program first reads the input values n and k, then calculates 2 raised to the power of the length of the binary representation of n (2 ** len(bin(n)[2:])) and subtracts 1 from it to get the largest xor-sum. If k is equal to 1, it returns n directly. This logic covers all possible cases as per the problem description and provides the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
