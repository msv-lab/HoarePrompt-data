Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input by spaces and converting them to integers. As the values of `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, the output state is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
