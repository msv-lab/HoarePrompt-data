The function `func` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The function does not have any parameters explicitly defined in the function signature, but it is assumed to accept `n` and `k` as arguments. The function does not have an explicit output defined in the prompt.
