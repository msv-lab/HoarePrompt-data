Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the user input, calculates the expression `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1` if `k - 1` is true, otherwise it prints the value of `n`. However, there is a missing edge case handling as the function should explicitly state that it expects input from the user and it should not be used as a standalone function without proper input handling. **
