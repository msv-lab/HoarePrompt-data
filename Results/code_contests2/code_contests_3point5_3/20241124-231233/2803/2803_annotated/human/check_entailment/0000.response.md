Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input values for n and k, calculates the largest possible xor-sum based on the given conditions, and outputs the result. The formula used to calculate the xor-sum is also in line with the problem description. Additionally, the program handles the edge case where k is 1 appropriately. Overall, the program seems to be correct for all potential cases.
