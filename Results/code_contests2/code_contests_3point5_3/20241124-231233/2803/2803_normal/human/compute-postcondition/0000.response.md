Example Answer:
The values of `n` and `k` are obtained by mapping the input to integers from user input. The values of `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the output state is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
