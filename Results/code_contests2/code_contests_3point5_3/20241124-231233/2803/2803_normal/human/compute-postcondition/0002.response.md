The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the result of the mathematical expression "n choose k", where n and k are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the result of the combination "n choose k" for the given constraints on n and k.
