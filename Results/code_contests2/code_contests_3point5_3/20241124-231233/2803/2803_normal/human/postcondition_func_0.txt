The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, then calculates and prints the result of the expression "n choose k". In this expression, if k-1 is not equal to 0, it calculates 2 raised to the power of the length of the binary representation of n minus 1. Otherwise, it simply prints the value of n. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it reads input from the user. The functionality of the function is to handle the calculation of "n choose k" based on the conditions specified.
