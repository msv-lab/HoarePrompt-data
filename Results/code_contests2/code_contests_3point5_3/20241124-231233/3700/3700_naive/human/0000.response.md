Correctness: **False**

The given program does not match the problem description. The function `func_2()` is not related to the problem statement at all. The program is missing the logic to determine the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not solve the stated problem.
