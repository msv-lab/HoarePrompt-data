Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes input for the number of monsters, the maximum number of special moves allowed, and the health of each monster. It then calculates the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do an Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning based on the given constraints and conditions. The program correctly follows the problem description and provides the expected output for the given examples. There are no edge cases or scenarios provided where the program fails to meet the requirements. Hence, the program is correct.
