Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads two integers `H` and `N` from user input, calculates the sum `s` of `N` integers also provided by the user, and then prints 'Yes' if the sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
