Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through the sequence of opened doors in reverse order and finds the smallest index k such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first k doors. The condition `if c[i] != c[i + 1]` checks if the door at index `i` is from a different exit than the door at index `i + 1`, which is the criteria for Mr. Black to be able to exit the house. The program then updates the answer `ans` to the correct index and prints it. 
The program covers all possible cases and correctly determines the smallest index k for Mr. Black to exit the house.
