According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 3 (since `n - 2` needs to be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to iterate). Before the loop starts, `ans` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 3, `c` is a list of integers, and `i` is `n - 2`.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`**
