According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is either `n - 1` if the element at index `i` in list `c` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` and the loop is broken, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and `i` is `n - 2`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n - 3`, as it is the next integer before `n - 2`.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is either `n - 1` if the element at index `n - 3` in list `c` is not equal to the element at index `n - 2` and the loop is broken, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `i` is `n - 3**.
