Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `c` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is greater than or equal to 1. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` and the code breaks out of the loop. This ensures that the program maintains the initial conditions and appropriately handles the comparison between consecutive elements in the list `c`.***
