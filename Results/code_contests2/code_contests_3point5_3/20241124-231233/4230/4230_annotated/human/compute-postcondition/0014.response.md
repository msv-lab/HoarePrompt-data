Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is calculated as `i + 1`. The initial state indicates that `i` is greater than or equal to 0, so `ans` will be at least 1 greater than `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `c` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `c` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is greater than or equal to 1**
