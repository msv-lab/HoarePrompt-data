Example Answer:
Each element in list `c` is converted to an integer using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The previous value of `n` is unknown, and `c` is a list of integers representing the sequence in which Mr. Black opened the doors. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `c` is a list of integers representing the sequence in which Mr. Black opened the doors.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `c` is a list of integers representing the sequence in which Mr. Black opened the doors**
