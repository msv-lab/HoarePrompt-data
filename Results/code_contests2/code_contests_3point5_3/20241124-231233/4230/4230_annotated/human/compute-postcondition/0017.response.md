According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `c` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is greater than or equal to 1. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `c` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is greater than or equal to 1**
