Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user, processes the sequence of door openings represented by the list `c`, and finds the index where there is a change in the door status from 0 to 1 or vice versa. The function then prints this index as the output. If the number of doors `n` is less than 3, the loop won't execute, and the output will be 0. **
