Output State: **If `n` is less than 3, the loop won't execute. If `n` is at least 3, `n` is an integer, `c` is a list of integers. The loop iterates through the list `c` backwards, checking if the element at index `i` is different from the element at index `i + 1`. If this condition is met, `ans` is updated to `i + 1` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. The value of `ans` is printed.**
