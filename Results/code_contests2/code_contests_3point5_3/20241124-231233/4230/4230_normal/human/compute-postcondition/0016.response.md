Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `ans` is equal to the value of `n - 1`, and `i` is equal to n - 3. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to i + 1 and the loop is broken. This condition covers all possible cases and ensures the correct behavior of the program after the execution of the if statement.***
