Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `ans` is equal to the value of `i + 1`, `i` is n - 1. If the element at index `i` in list `c` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` and the loop breaks. The program variables retain their initial values and relationships, with the additional condition that if the loop does not break, no changes occur to the variables.***
