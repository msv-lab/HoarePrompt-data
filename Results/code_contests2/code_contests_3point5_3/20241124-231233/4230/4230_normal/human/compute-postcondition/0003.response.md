Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, but the values of `n` and `c` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is the first integer from the map of integers obtained from raw input split, c is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, ans is 0.
Output State: **n is the first integer from the map of integers obtained from raw input split, c is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, ans is 0**
