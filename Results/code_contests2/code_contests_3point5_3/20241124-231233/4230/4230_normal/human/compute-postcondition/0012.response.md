Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `ans` is equal to the value of `n - 1`, `i` is n - 2. If c[i] is not equal to c[i + 1], then ans is updated to i + 1 and the loop is terminated. This condition covers the scenario where there is a change in consecutive elements of the list 'c'.***
