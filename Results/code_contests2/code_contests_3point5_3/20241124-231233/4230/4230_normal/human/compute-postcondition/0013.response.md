According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `ans` is equal to the value of `n - 1`, `i` is n - 2. If c[i] is not equal to c[i + 1], then ans is updated to i + 1 and the loop is terminated.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 to continue iterating through the list.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `ans` is equal to the value of `n - 1`, `i` is n - 3**
