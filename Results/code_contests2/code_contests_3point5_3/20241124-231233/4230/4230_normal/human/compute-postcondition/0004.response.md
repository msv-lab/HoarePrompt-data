According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is the first integer from the map of integers obtained from raw input split does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `ans` is 0, and `i` is n - 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 1**
