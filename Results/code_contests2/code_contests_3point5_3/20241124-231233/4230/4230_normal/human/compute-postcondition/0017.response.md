According to the code, the loop will execute until i reaches -1. At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than or equal to 3, c is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, ans is equal to the value of n - 1, and i is equal to n - 3. If c[i] is not equal to c[i + 1], then ans is updated to i + 1 and the loop is broken.

For the loop to execute one more time, i needs to be decremented by 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **n is greater than or equal to 3, c is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, ans is equal to the value of n - 1, and i is equal to n - 4**
