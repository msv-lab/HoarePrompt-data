The function `func` reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the index of the first change in consecutive elements of the input list `c`. The function does not explicitly return any value. The input must follow specific constraints: `n` must be between 2 and 200,000, and `c` is a list of `n` integers containing only 0s and 1s. If there are no changes in consecutive elements of `c`, the function prints 0.
