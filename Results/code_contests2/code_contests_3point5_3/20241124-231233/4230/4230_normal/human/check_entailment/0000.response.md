Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads the number of doors and the sequence of doors opened correctly.
- It then iterates over the sequence of opened doors from the end to the beginning to find the smallest index `k` where there is a change in consecutive elements.
- It correctly identifies the index where Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first `k` doors.
- The output matches the problem description and the provided examples.
- The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that it behaves as expected.
