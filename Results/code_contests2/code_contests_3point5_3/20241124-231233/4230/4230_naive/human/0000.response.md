Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. It calculates the smallest index k such that after Mr. Black opened the first k doors, he was able to exit the house. However, the program logic is flawed and does not produce the correct output for all potential cases.

An example where the program fails:
Input
```
5
0 0 0 1 1
```
Output
```
3
```
Explanation:
In this case, the correct output should be 5, as Mr. Black needs to open all the doors to exit the house. However, the program incorrectly outputs 3.
