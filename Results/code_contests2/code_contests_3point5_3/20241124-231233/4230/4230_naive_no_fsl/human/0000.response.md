Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly finds the smallest index k such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first k doors. It iterates through the sequence of opened doors in reverse order and checks if the door in the current position is in a different exit than the next door. If it finds a door in a different exit, it updates the answer to be the current index + 1. This logic ensures that the program correctly determines the smallest index k where Mr. Black can exit the house. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected based on the problem description.
