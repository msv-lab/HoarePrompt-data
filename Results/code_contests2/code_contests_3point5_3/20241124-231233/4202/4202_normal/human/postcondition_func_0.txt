The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input strings of 0s and 1s, calculates the number of occurrences of '1' in each input, and prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first input is greater than or equal to the count in the second input; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function assumes the inputs are valid strings of 0s and 1s.
