Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two input strings of 0s and 1s, calculates the number of occurrences of '1' in each input, and prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first input is greater than or equal to the count in the second input; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The code follows the problem description for every potential case as it correctly implements the logic required to determine if it is possible to turn string `a` into string `b` based on the count of '1's in each string. The code handles all cases appropriately and provides the correct output.
