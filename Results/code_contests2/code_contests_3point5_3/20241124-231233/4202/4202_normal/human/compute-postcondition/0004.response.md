Example Answer:
The value of `i` is checked if it is equal to '1'. If the input from `raw_input()` is '1', then `pa` is incremented by 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is incremented by 1 if the input from `raw_input()` is '1', `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`pa` is incremented by 1 if the input from `raw_input()` is '1', `a` and `b` remain unchanged**
