Example Answer:
The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The initial value of `pa` is 0, and the values of `a` and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is incremented by 1 if the input from `raw_input()` is '1', `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`pa` is incremented by 1 if the input from `raw_input()` is '1', `a` and `b` remain unchanged**
