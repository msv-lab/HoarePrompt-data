Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of '1' in the extended input. The previous value of `pb` is unknown, but `i` iterates over the extended input. Therefore, the output state is `pa` is adjusted based on the number of '1's in the extended input, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `pb` is incremented by 1 for each additional occurrence of '1' in the extended input.
Output State: **`pa` is adjusted based on the number of '1's in the extended input, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `pb` is incremented by 1 for each additional occurrence of '1' in the extended input**
