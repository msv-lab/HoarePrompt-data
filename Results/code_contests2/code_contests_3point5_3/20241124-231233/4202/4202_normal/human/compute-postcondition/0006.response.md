Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is determined by the next input from `raw_input()`, and if `i` is equal to '1', then `pa` is incremented by 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `pa` is adjusted based on the next input from `raw_input()`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`pa` is adjusted based on the next input from `raw_input()`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged**
