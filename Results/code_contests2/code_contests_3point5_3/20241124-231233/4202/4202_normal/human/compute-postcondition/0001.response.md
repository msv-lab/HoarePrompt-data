According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is at least one character in the input provided by `raw_input()`. Since the state before the loop starts does not provide any information about the input, we need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the input from `raw_input()` should have at least one character. 
State: **`pa` is 0, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, input from `raw_input()` has at least one character**
