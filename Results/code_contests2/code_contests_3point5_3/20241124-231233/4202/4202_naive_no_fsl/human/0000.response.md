Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the parity of the input strings 'a' and 'b' by counting the number of '1's in each string. It then compares the parities and prints "YES" if the parity of 'a' is greater than or equal to the parity of 'b', and "NO" otherwise. The program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
