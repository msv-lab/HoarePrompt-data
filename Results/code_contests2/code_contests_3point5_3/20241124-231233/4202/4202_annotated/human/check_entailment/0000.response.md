Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the number of occurrences of '1' in both strings `a` and `b`, then checks if the number of '1's in `a` is greater than or equal to the number of '1's in `b`. If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". This logic follows the problem description accurately. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
