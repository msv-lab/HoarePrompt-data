According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input string. Since the loop requires an input, the input string must not be empty. Therefore, `raw_input()` should not be an empty string. Before the loop starts, a and b are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `raw_input()` is not an empty string, and `pa` is 0. 
State: **`a` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `b` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is 0, `raw_input()` is not an empty string**
