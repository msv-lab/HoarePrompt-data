According to the code, the loop will execute as long as raw_input() is not an empty string. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `pa` needs to be incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i` for each iteration, `pb` remains 0, and `a` and `b` remain 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i` for each iteration, `pb` is 0**
