According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input `i`. If there is more input to process, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i` for each iteration, `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the input `i` must have more characters to process. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the length of `a` and `b`, as well as the values of `pa` and `pb` based on the input `i`.

State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i`, `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'**
