Example Answer: 
The value of `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `pa`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `b` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i`.
Output State: **`a` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `b` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i`**
