Output State: **`pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input for each iteration, `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'. If `raw_input()` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `pa` remains the same value, `pb` is 0. Then, print 'NO' if `pa` is greater than or equal to `pb`, otherwise print 'YES'.**
