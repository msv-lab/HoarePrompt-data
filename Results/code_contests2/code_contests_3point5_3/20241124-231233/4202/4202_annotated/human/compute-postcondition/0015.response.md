Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'. The previous value of `pb` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i`, `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i`, `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'**
