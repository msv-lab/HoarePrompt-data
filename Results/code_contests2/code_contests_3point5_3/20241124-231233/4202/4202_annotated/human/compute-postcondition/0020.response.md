Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on two 01-strings, `a` and `b`, which are of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The function calculates the number of occurrences of '1' in each string. It then prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in string `a` is greater than or equal to the count of '1's in string `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If the input strings are empty, the loops do not execute, and the comparison is based on the initial values of `pa` and `pb`, which are 0. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
