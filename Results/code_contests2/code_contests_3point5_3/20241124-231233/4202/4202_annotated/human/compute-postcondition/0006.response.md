Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the input `i` is '1'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `pa` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `b` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i` where `i` is one character longer.
Output State: **`a` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `b` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i` where `i` is one character longer**
