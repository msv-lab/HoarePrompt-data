According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `b` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, the input `i` should have at least one more character. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the length of the input strings `a` and `b`.
State: **`a` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `b` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i` where `i` is one character longer**
