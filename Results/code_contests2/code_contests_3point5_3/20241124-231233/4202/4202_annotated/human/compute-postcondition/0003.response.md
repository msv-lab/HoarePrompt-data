According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the input string received from `raw_input()`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `b` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i`, and `raw_input()` is not an empty string. 

To execute the loop one more time, the input string `i` must not be empty. So, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`a` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `b` is an 01-string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i`, `raw_input()` is not an empty string**
