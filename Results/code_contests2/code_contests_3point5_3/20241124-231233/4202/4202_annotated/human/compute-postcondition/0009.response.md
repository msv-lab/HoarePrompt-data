Output State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the input `i` for each iteration of the loop. The loop will always execute as long as `raw_input()` is not an empty string. If `raw_input()` is an empty string, the loop will not execute and `pa` will remain 0. `pb` is 0**
