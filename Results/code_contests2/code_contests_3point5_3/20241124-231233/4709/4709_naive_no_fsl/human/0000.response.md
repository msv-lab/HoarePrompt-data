Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program is not correct according to the problem description. The program seems to be attempting to compare two numbers digit by digit and count the number of occurrences where the digits at symmetric positions are the same. This logic does not align with the problem description of extracting letters from a 3x3 grid along the diagonal.

Additionally, the program uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3, it should be replaced with `input()`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the given problem description and is incorrect.
