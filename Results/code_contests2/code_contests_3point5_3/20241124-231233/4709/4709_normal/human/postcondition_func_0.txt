The function `func` reads 3 rows of lowercase English letters, each row containing 3 letters as input. It then compares the first and second letters in the input rows. If they are equal, it sets `ans` to 1. After that, it iterates through a range of integers from the integer value of A to B. For each iteration where the first and last digits of the integer are equal and the second and fourth digits are equal, `ans` is incremented by 1. The final value of `ans` is then printed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
