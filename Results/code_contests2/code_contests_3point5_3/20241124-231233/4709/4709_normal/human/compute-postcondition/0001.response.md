Example Answer:
The variable `l` is assigned the result of splitting the string contained in `a` into a list. Since `a` contains 9 lowercase English letters, after splitting it, the list `l` will contain 9 elements, each element representing one of the letters in `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` contains 9 lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing those 9 letters.
Output State: **`a` contains 9 lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing those 9 letters**
