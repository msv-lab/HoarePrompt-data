Example Answer:
The string `a` is split into a list `l` based on whitespace. The value of `a` is a lowercase English letter, so after splitting, `l` will contain each letter as a separate element in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a lowercase English letter; `l` is a list containing the individual letters of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a lowercase English letter; `l` is a list containing the individual letters of `a`**
