Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, so after execution, `ans` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a lowercase English letter, `l` is a list containing the individual letters of `a`, `A` is assigned the second element of list `l` + 1, `B` is assigned the third element of list `l`, `ans` is an integer and it has been increased by 1.
