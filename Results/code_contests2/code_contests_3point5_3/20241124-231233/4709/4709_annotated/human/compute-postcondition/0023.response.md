Output State: **`a` is a lowercase English letter, `l` is a list containing the individual letters of `a`, `A` is assigned the second element of list `l` + 1, `B` is assigned the third element of list `l`, `ans` is an integer. If the string representation of the integer value of `A` has the first and fifth characters equal and the second and fourth characters equal, `ans` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values. If the integer value of `A` is greater than or equal to the integer value of `B`, then the loop does not execute. `ans` is printed.**
