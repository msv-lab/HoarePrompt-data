The function reads a user input, splits it into two parts, assigns those parts to variables A and B, and checks if the integer representations of A and B are equal. If they are equal, the variable ans is set to 1. Then, it iterates over a range of values starting from A and ending before B, incrementing ans by 1 for each number where the first and fifth digits are equal and the second and fourth digits are equal in their string representation. Finally, it prints the value of ans. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
