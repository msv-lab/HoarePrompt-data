The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input and a string `strings`. It then shifts each character in `strings` by `n` positions in the English alphabet, wrapping around if needed, and prints the resulting modified string. The function operates under the constraint that `n` is an integer between 0 and 26, and `strings` is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase English letters. If `strings` is empty, the function does not perform any character shifting and prints an empty string.
