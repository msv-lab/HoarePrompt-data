Example Answer:
The variable `index` is calculated based on the position of the first character of `S` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. Then, `added_index` is calculated by adding `n` to `index`, and `new_index` is calculated as the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26. Finally, `new_s` is assigned the character at position `new_index` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The output state reflects the updated values of the variables: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, n is the input integer, strings is the input string, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, s is the first character in strings, index is the index of the first character of S in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', added_index is the result of the calculation index + n, new_index is the result of added_index % 26, new_s is the character at position new_index in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, n is the input integer, strings is the input string, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, s is the first character in strings, index is the index of the first character of S in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', added_index is the result of the calculation index + n, new_index is the result of added_index % 26, new_s is the character at position new_index in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'**
