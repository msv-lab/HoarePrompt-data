Example Answer:
The value of `added_index` is calculated by adding `n` to `index`. The value of `index` is the index of the first character of `S` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The result of `added_index` is then calculated modulo 26 to get `new_index`. The output state after this code is executed is that `added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, and `new_index` is the result of the calculation `(index + n) % 26`.
Output State: **`added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of the calculation `(index + n) % 26`**
