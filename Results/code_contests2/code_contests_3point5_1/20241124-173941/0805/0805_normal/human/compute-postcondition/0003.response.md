Example Answer:
`new_strings` is initialized as an empty string. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the input integer obtained from the user, `strings` is the input string entered by the user, `letters` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string.
