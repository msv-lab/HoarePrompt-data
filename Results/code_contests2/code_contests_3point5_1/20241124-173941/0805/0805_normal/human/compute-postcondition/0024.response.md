Example Answer:
If the input string is empty, the loop won't execute, and `new_strings` will remain empty. If the input string is not empty, the loop will iterate through each character in the string, calculate the new index based on the input integer 'n', and append the corresponding character from 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' to `new_strings`. The final `new_strings` will contain the characters corresponding to the new indices calculated during each iteration.

Output State: **If the input string is empty, `new_strings` is empty. If the input string is not empty, `new_strings` contains the characters corresponding to the new indices calculated during each iteration.**
