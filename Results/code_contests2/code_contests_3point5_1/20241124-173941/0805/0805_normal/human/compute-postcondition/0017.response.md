Example Answer:
The value of `index` is assigned by finding the index of character `s` in the `letters` list. The variables `added_index`, `new_index`, `new_s`, and `new_strings` are affected by this assignment. The new value of `index` is determined by the index of character `s` in the `letters` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of the calculation `(index + n) % 26`, `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is appended with `new_s`.
Output State: **`added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of the calculation `(index + n) % 26`, `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is appended with `new_s`**
