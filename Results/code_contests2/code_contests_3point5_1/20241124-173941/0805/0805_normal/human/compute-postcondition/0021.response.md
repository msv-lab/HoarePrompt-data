Example Answer: 
After executing the code snippet, `new_s` is appended to `new_strings`. The value of `new_s` is based on the value of `new_index`, which is between 0 to 25. Therefore, the output state is: `added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is either 0 to 25, `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` has been appended with `new_s`.
Output State: **`added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is either 0 to 25, `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` has been appended with `new_s`**
