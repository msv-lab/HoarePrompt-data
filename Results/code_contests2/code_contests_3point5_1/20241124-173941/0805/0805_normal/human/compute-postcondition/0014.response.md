Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`, where `new_index` is the result of the calculation `(index + n) % 26`. The values of `index`, `n`, and `letters` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific value of `new_s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of the calculation `(index + n) % 26`, and `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`.
Output State: **`added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of the calculation `(index + n) % 26`, and `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`**
