Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`. The previous values of `index` and `n` are unknown, so the exact value of `new_index` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is either 0 to 25, `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is appended with `new_s`.
Output State: **`added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is either 0 to 25, `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is appended with `new_s`**
