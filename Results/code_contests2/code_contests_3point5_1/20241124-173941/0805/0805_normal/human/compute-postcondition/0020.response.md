Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the value `letters[new_index]`. The value of `new_index` can be any number from 0 to 25, so `new_s` is assigned the corresponding letter from the `letters` list. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is either 0 to 25, `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is appended with `new_s`.
Output State: **`added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is either 0 to 25, `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is appended with `new_s`**
