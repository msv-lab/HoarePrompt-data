According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the strings list. If there are more strings left in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is between 0 to 25, `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` has been appended with `new_s`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the strings list must still have more strings remaining to be iterated over.
State: **`added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is between 0 to 25, `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`, `new_strings` has been appended with `new_s`**
