Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`. The previous values of `index` and `n` are unknown, so the output state is: `added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of the calculation `(index + n) % 26`.
Output State: **`added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of the calculation `(index + n) % 26`**
