Example Answer:
The value of `added_index` is calculated as `index + n`. The initial state specifies that `N` is an integer between 0 and 26, `index` is the index of the first character of `S` in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. Therefore, after the calculation, the value of `added_index` could vary based on the user input for `N` and the position of the first character of `S` in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, n is the input integer, strings is the input string, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, s is the first character in strings, index is the index of the first character of S in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', added_index is the result of the calculation index + n**
