Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`, where `index` and `n` are the previous values of the variables. The state of `new_index`, `new_s`, and `new_strings` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of the calculation `(index + n) % 26`, `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is appended with `new_s`.
Output State: **`added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of the calculation `(index + n) % 26`, `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is appended with `new_s`**
