Example Answer:
`new_s` is added to `new_strings`. The value of `new_s` is dependent on `new_index`, which is calculated based on `(index + n) % 26`. The value of `new_index` is not directly provided, but it is derived from `index` and `n`. The variables `added_index` and `new_index` are not directly affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of the calculation `(index + n) % 26`, `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is appended with `new_s`.
Output State: **`added_index` is the result of the calculation `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of the calculation `(index + n) % 26`, `new_s` is the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is appended with `new_s`**
