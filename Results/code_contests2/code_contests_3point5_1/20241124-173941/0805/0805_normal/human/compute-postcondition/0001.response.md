Example Answer:
The input function reads a string from the user and assigns it to the variable `strings`. The value of `strings` will be the string entered by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4, and `n` is the input integer obtained from the user, `strings` is the input string entered by the user.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the input integer obtained from the user, `strings` is the input string entered by the user**
