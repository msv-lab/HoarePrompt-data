Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer N and a string S as input, shifts each character of S by N in alphabetical order, and then prints the resulting string. The program correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem description and follows the logic of shifting each character by N in alphabetical order. 

For example, for input N=2 and S='ABCXYZ', the program correctly outputs 'CDEZAB', where each character of the string S has been shifted by 2 in alphabetical order.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided examples, the program is correct and produces the expected output for all potential cases.
