The function `func` reads an integer `N` and a string `S` as input. It shifts each character in the string `S` by `N` positions in the English alphabet. The function then prints the resulting modified string. The function assumes `N` is between 0 and 26, and `S` contains only uppercase English letters. If the string `S` is empty, the function will not perform any character shifting and will print an empty string.
