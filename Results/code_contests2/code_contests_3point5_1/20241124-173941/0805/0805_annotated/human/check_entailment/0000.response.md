Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes an integer N as input and a string S. It then shifts each character of the string S by N positions in alphabetical order and prints the resulting string. The program correctly handles the shifting logic by calculating the new index based on the given conditions and adding the new character to the result string. The program also correctly handles the edge case of an empty input string. 

The program satisfies the problem description for all potential cases and the provided examples, making it correct.
