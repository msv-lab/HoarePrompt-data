Output State: **If the string `strings` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `new_strings` will remain an empty string. If the string `strings` is not empty, the loop will iterate through each character, calculate the new character based on the given conditions, and add it to `new_strings`. The final `new_strings` will contain the characters from `letters` shifted by `N` positions.**
