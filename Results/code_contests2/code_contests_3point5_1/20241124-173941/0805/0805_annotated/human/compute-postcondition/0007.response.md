Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is the result of `index + N`. The value of `N` can range from 0 to 26, and `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, the modulo operation ensures that `new_index` falls within the range of 0 to 25. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing all uppercase English letters, `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, and `added_index` is the result of `index + N`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing all uppercase English letters, `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, and `added_index` is the result of `index + N`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26**
