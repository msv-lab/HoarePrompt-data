Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`, where `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`. Since `N` is an integer between 0 and 26, and `index` is the index of a character in a string, the value of `added_index` can vary based on the values of `N` and the specific character in `S`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing all uppercase English letters, `new_strings` is an empty string, and `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, and `added_index` is the result of `index + N`.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing all uppercase English letters, `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, and `added_index` is the result of `index + N`**
