Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` will be between 0 and 26 according to the precondition. The state of other variables is not affected. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26. `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4.**
