Example Answer:
The variable `strings` is assigned the value of the input. The input can be any string of uppercase English letters. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, `strings` is the input string.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, `strings` is the input string**
