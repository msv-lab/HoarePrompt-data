Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes an integer N and a string S as input. It then shifts each character of the string S by N in alphabetical order. The program uses the uppercase English letters 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' to perform the shifting.

The program correctly handles shifting the characters by N in alphabetical order and ensures that the shifted character wraps around if it exceeds 'Z'. It also correctly handles all possible cases where the input constraints are satisfied.

The program iterates over each character in the input string, finds the index of the character in the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string, adds the shift value N, takes the modulo 26 to handle wrapping around 'Z', and then retrieves the new character from the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string to form the new string.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
