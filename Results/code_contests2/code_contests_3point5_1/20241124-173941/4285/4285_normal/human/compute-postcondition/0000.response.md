Example Answer:
The code snippet iterates over each character in the string representation of the positive integer `n`, converts each character to lowercase if it is an alphabet, and then joins the characters back together. Since `n` is a positive integer, the string representation of `n` does not contain any alphabet characters. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer**
