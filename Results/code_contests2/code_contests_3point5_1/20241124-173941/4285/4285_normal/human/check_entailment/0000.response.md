Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not follow the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to return the n-th even-length positive palindrome number. However, the function actually accepts a string `n`, extracts all alphabetic characters, converts them to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome. This is not the intended functionality as per the problem description. Additionally, the output hints do not match the actual code implementation, making it clear that the code does not correctly solve the given problem. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not provide the n-th even-length positive palindrome number as required by the problem description.
