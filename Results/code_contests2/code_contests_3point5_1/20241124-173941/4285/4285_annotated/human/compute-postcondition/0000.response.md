Example Answer:
The list comprehension iterates over each character in the string `n`, checks if it is an alphabet character using `x.isalpha()`, converts it to lowercase using `x.lower()`, and then joins all these characters together. So, the value of `x` will be a new string containing only the alphabet characters from `n` converted to lowercase.
Output State: **`n` is a string containing alphanumeric characters, `x` is a new string containing only alphabet characters from `n` converted to lowercase**
