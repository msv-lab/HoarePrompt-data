Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program initializes a boolean array `a` of size 1000000 with all values set to `True`.
2. It then iterates from 2 to 999999 and marks all non-prime numbers as `False` in the array `a`.
3. The program then reads integers from the input until EOF and prints the count of prime numbers less than or equal to the input number.
4. The program correctly counts the number of prime numbers for all potential cases within the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999).
