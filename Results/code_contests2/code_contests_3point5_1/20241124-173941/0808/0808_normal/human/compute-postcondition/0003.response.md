According to the code, for the loop to execute, the loop variable `j` must be within the range [i ** 2 - 1, 1000000) with a step size of `i`. Therefore, the loop will execute if i ** 2 - 1 is less than 1000000. Before the loop starts, the element at index i - 1 in a is True implies that i is a valid index for array `a`. Additionally, since i is 2, i ** 2 - 1 = 3, which satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, a contains 1000000 True values, i is 2, the element at index i - 1 in a is True, j is 3**
