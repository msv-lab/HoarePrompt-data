Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, a contains 999998 True values and 3 False values at index 5, i is 3, the element at index i - 1 in a is True, j is an odd number greater than 5. If a[i - 1] is True, then for every odd number j after the current value, such that i ** 2 - 1 ≤ j < 1000000, the element a[j] is set to False.***
