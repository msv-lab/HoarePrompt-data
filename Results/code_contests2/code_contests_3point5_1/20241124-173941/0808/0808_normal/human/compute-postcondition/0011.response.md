Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, a contains 1000000 boolean values. If n is 1, a will contain 1000000 True values and i will be 2. If n is greater than 1, a will contain 999998 True values and 2 False values at index 5 and j. In both cases, i will be 2 and the element at index i - 1 in a will be True. After the loop executes, j will be an odd number greater than 5.***
