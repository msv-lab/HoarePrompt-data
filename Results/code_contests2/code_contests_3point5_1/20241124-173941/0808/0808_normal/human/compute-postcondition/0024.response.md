Example Answer:
The value at index `j` in list `a` is assigned `False`. Given that there are 999998 True values and 3 False values in list `a`, after this assignment, there will be 4 False values in list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` contains 999996 True values and 5 False values at index 5, `i`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` contains 999996 True values and 5 False values at index 5, `i`**
