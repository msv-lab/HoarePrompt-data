According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `j` is within the specified range. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, a contains 999999 True values and 1 False value at index 3, i is 2, the element at index i - 1 in a is True, j is 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- The value of `j` needs to be updated to the next value within the range specified by the loop statement.
- Since `i` is 2, the next value of `j` would be 2 ** 2 - 1 + 2 = 5. 
- The element at index 5 in list `a` should be True in order for the loop to continue.

State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, a contains 999999 True values and 1 False value at index 5, i is 2, the element at index i - 1 in a is True, j is 5**
