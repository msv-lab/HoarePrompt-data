According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `j` is within the specified range. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` contains 999998 True values and 2 False values at index 5 and the next odd number after `j`, `i` is 3, the element at index `i - 1` in `a` is True, `j` is the next odd number after the current value, `a[j]` is False. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following need to be updated:
1. `n` remains the same as it does not affect the loop execution.
2. Since the loop increments `j` by `i`, the new value of `j` should be the next odd number after the current value, which is the next odd number after the current `j`.
3. As the loop condition is `j` ranging from `i ** 2 - 1` to 1000000, the new value of `j` should be such that it satisfies this condition.
4. The rest of the states remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` contains 999998 True values and 2 False values at index 5 and the next odd number after `j`, `i` is 3, the element at index `i - 1` in `a` is True, `j` is the next odd number after the current value, `a[j]` is False**
