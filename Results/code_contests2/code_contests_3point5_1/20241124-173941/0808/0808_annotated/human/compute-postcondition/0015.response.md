According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the last element in the range `i ** 2 - 1` to 1000000 with a step of `i`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be less than 1000000. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to less than 1000000.
State: **`a` is a list of 1000000 elements where the multiples of `i+1` greater than `i+1` are False while other elements remain True, `j` is less than 1000000**
