Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1000000 elements. If `i` is 999999 and `j` is less than 1000000, then the loop executes updating `a` by setting one element to False. After the loop, `a` will have one False element and 999999 True elements. `i` remains 999999, and `j` is less than 999998. If `i` is 1000000 or higher, the loop does not execute. In any case, `a` remains a list of 1000000 elements with only one False element and the rest True elements.***
