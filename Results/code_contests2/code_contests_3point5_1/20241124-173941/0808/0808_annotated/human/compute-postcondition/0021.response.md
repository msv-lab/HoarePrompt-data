Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1000000 elements. If `i` is less than or equal to 1, the list remains the same. If `i` is greater than 1, the list `a` is modified such that the multiples of `i+1` greater than `i+1` are set to False while other elements remain True. Additionally, after the loop executes, the variable `j` is less than 1000000.***
