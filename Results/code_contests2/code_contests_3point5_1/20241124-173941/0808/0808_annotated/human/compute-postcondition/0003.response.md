According to the code, the loop can execute if the range specified by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)` is valid. 
For the loop to execute, `i ** 2 - 1` needs to be less than 1000000 and `i` should not be 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`a` is a list of 1000000 elements, all set to True, `i` is not 0, `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000, the element at index 1 of `a` is True**
