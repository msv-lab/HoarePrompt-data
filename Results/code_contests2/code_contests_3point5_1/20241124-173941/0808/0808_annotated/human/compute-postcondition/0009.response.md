According to the code, the loop executes as long as `j` is within the range `(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000)` and increments by `i` in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with all but the element at index `j` set to `True`, `i` is not 0, `j` is the next multiple of `i` greater than the current value within the range `(i, 1000000)`, `a[j]` is set to `False`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be the next multiple of `i` greater than the current value within the range `(i, 1000000)` after the last iteration.
State: **`a` is a list of 1000000 elements with all but the element at index `j` set to `True`, `i` is not 0, `j` is the next multiple of `i` greater than the current value within the range `(i, 1000000)`, `a[j]` is set to `False`, `j` is the next multiple of `i` greater than the current value within the range `(i, 1000000)` after the last iteration**
