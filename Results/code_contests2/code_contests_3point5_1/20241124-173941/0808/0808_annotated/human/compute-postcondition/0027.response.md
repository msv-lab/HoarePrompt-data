According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than 999998, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 999999, `j` is less than 999998. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` should be adjusted to be 999998.
State: **`a` is a list of 1000000 elements with one element set to False, `i` is 999999, `j` is 999998**
