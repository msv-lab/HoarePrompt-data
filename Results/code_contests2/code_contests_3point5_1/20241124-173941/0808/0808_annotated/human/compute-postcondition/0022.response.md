According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1000000 which means the loop will not execute again. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1000000 - 1 = 999999 for the loop to execute one more time. Additionally, the variable `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than 1000000 as specified after the loop executes.
State: **`a` is a list of 1000000 elements, `i` is 999999, `j` is less than 1000000**
