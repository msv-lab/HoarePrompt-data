Example Answer:
The value of the element at index `j` in list `a` is set to `False`. The list `a` has 1000000 elements, all initially set to `True`, so after this operation, only the element at index `j` will be `False`. The value of `i` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with all but the element at index `j` set to `True`, `i` is not 0.
Output State: **`a` is a list of 1000000 elements with all but the element at index `j` set to `True`, `i` is not 0**
