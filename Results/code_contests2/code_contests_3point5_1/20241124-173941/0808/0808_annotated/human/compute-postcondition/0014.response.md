Example Answer: 
The value of `a[j]` is set to False. The state of the list `a` changes for index `j`, making the element at that index False. The rest of the elements remain True. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1000000 elements where the multiples of `i+1` greater than `i+1` are False while other elements remain True.
Output State: **`a` is a list of 1000000 elements where the multiples of `i+1` greater than `i+1` are False while other elements remain True**
