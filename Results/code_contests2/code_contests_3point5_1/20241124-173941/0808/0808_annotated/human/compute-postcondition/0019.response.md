According to the code, the loop can execute again if the range defined by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)` still has valid values for `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements where the multiples of `j+1` greater than `j+1` are False while other elements remain True, `j` is less than 1000000. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next valid value for `j` within the range should be considered. Since the loop increments `j` by `i`, the next valid value for `j` within the current range can be obtained by adding `i` to the last value of `j`. 

Therefore, adjust the state as follows:
State: **`a` is a list of 1000000 elements where the multiples of `j+1` greater than `j+1` are False while other elements remain True, `j` is less than 1000000 and the next valid value for `j` within the range is calculated by adding `i` to the last value of `j`**
