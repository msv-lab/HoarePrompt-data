Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1000000 elements. If the element at index `i - 1` is True, then all elements at multiples of `i` greater than `i` in the list are set to False. The state of the list `a` after the execution of the if statement ensures that the multiples of `i` greater than `i` are False while other elements remain True.***
