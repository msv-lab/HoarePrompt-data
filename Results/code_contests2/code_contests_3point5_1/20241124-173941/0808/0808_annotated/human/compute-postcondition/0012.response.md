According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements where the multiples of `i` greater than `i` are False while other elements remain True. For the loop to execute one more time, the state of the list `a` must be adjusted such that the multiples of `i+1` greater than `i+1` are False while other elements remain True. 
State: **`a` is a list of 1000000 elements where the multiples of `i+1` greater than `i+1` are False while other elements remain True**
