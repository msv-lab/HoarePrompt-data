According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 999999 and `j` is less than 999998. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it should be adjusted to 1000000. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a list of 1000000 elements with one False element and the rest True elements, `i` is 1000000, `j` is less than 999998**
