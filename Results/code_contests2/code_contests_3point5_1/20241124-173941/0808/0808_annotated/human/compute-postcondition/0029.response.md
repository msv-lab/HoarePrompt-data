According to the code, the loop can execute again if the range specified by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)` has more elements to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with one element set to False, `i` is 999999, `j` is 999998. For the loop to execute one more time, the range specified should have more elements to iterate over, so `1000000` should be greater than `i ** 2 - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a list of 1000000 elements with one element set to False, `i` is 999999, `j` is 999998**
