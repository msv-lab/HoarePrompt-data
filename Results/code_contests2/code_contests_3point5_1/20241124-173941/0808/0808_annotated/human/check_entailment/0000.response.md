Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. The logic used in the program to identify prime numbers is incorrect. The program marks multiples of numbers as non-prime, but it should mark non-prime numbers instead. This logic error will lead to incorrect results for prime number counts.

Example:
Input:
10

Output:
3

Expected Output:
4

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not produce the expected output for all potential cases.
