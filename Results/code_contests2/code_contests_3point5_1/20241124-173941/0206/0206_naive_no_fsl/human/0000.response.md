Correctness: False

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum distance to be traveled by AtCoDeer. The program is using `raw_input()` which is not the correct way to take input in Python. Additionally, the program is not converting the input values to integers before performing calculations. The use of `np.abs` also suggests that numpy library is being used but it is not imported in the code. Overall, the program is incorrect and does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
