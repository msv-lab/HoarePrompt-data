Example Answer:
The program prints the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000. The values of N and a_i are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for all i; `ans` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for all i; `ans` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000**
