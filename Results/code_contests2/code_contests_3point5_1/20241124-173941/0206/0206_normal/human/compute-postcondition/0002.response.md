Example Answer:
The `ans` variable is assigned the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `a`. Given that `a_i` values are between 0 and 1000 for all i, the maximum value that `ans` can take is 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for all i; `ans` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for all i; `ans` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1000**
