Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input. The values of `N` and `a_i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for all i.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for all i**
