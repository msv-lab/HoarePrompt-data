Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user, calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the input array, and prints the result. However, the annotations mention the use of `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python. The code is missing important details such as importing necessary libraries like numpy (np) and converting input values to integers for accurate calculations. Therefore, the function most likely reads input values and calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the input array without handling potential errors like non-integer inputs. **
