Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which accepts input as a string. The values of `N` and `a_i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for all i.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for all i**
