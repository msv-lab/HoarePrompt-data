Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the input correctly. The code uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python. Additionally, the code does not convert the input values to integers for accurate calculations. These issues make the code incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code also does not calculate the minimum distance to be traveled as required.
