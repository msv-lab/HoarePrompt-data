Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum distance to be traveled by AtCoDeer. The program is simply finding the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates of the houses, which is not the correct approach.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 10 3 7 5
```
The correct minimum distance to be traveled is 9 (travel from house at coordinate 1 to house at coordinate 10), but the program would output 9 (absolute difference between 10 and 1). 

Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases, making the correctness as **False**.
