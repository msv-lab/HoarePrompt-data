Correctness: **False**

The given program is not correct because:
1. The program is using `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python. Instead, `input()` should be used to take input from standard input.
2. The program is trying to find the minimum distance to be traveled by calculating the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates. However, this logic is incorrect as it does not consider the fact that AtCoDeer can start and end his travel at any positions. The correct approach would be to find the minimum distance between any two houses along TopCoDeer street.
3. The program is missing the import statement for numpy library which is required for using `np.abs` and `np.max`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
