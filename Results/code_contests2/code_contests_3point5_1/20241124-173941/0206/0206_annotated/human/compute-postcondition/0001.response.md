Example Answer: 
The variable `a` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which takes a raw input and splits it into a list based on whitespace. As no specific value for `N` is provided, the output state is `N` is a raw input, `a` is a list resulting from splitting the raw input.
Output State: **`N` is a raw input, `a` is a list resulting from splitting the raw input**
