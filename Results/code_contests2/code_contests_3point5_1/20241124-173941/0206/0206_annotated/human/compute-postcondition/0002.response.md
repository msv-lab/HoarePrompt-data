Example Answer:
The function `np.max(a)` returns the maximum value in list `a`, and `np.min(a)` returns the minimum value in list `a`. The absolute difference between these two values is calculated and assigned to `ans`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `N` and `a`, the output state will be dependent on the actual values input by the user.
Output State: **Dependent on the input values of `N` and `a`, `ans` will be the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`.**
