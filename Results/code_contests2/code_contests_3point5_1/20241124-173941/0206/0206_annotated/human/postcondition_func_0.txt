The function `func` reads input from the user, splits the input into a list, calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list using numpy functions, and then prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters, and the output is displayed to the console. The annotations mention `raw_input` which is not standard Python, and the usage of `np.abs`, `np.max`, and `np.min` without importing the numpy library, so this functionality might not work as intended.
