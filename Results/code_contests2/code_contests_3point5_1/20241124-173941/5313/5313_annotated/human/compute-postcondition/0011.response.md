Example Answer:
`answr` is converted to an integer value. The value of `answr` is determined based on the conditions provided, and it can be either 4 times the square root of `n`, twice the sum of the square root of `n` and 1, or 4 times the square root of `n` plus 4. The specific value of `answr` depends on the value of `n` and the calculation performed according to the conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n as an integer, and answr is the calculated value based on the conditions.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n as an integer, and answr is the calculated value based on the conditions**
