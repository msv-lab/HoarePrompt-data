Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Given that x is the square root of n as an integer and the square of x is not equal to n, the product of x and (x+1) is greater than n. Therefore, the value of `answr` is calculated accordingly. 
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n as an integer. The square of x is not equal to n. The product of x and (x+1) is greater than n; answr is calculated value of (x + x + 1) * 2**
