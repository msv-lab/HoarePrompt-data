Example Answer: 
The value of `answr` is calculated by multiplying `x` by 4. Since `x` is the square root of `n`, and the square of `x` is equal to `n`, `x` is the square root of `n`. Therefore, `answr` is equal to `n` multiplied by 4. 
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n as an integer, answr is 4 times the square root of n**
