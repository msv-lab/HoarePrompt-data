Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n as an integer. If x^2 is equal to n, then answr is computed as 4 times the square root of n. In the case where x * (x + 1) is greater than n, answr is evaluated as (x + x + 1) * 2. On the other hand, if x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, answr is set to 4 * (x + 1).***
