Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, where `n` is the input integer. The square root of `n` is calculated and then converted to an integer, and that value is assigned to `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n as an integer.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n as an integer**
