Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the square root `x` of `n`, and then determines the value of `answr` based on certain conditions. If the square of `x` is equal to `n`, `answr` is set to 4 times the square root of `n`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, `answr` is computed as `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Otherwise, if `x * (x + 1)` is less than or equal to `n`, `answr` is assigned as `4 * (x + 1)`. The final calculated `answr` is printed as an integer. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific output based on input parameters.
