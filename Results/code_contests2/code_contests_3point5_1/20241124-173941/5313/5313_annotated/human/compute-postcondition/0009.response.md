Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n as an integer, and the square of x is not equal to n. If x * (x + 1) is greater than n, then answr is calculated as (x + x + 1) * 2. Otherwise, if x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, answr is determined as 4 * (x + 1).***
