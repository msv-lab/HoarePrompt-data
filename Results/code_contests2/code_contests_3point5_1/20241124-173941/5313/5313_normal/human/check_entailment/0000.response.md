Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes an integer input `n` representing the number of city blocks that must be enclosed by the route. It then calculates the square root of `n` and based on certain conditions assigns a value to `answr`. If `x^2` is equal to `n`, then `answr` is set to 4 times `x`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, `answr` is calculated as `(x + x + 1) * 2`. If `x * (x + 1)` is less than or equal to `n`, `answr` is calculated as `4 * (x + 1`. The code appears to be following the problem description for all potential cases and the examples provided. The logic seems sound and the code is correctly computing the minimum perimeter that can be achieved for a given number of city blocks. The output hints also align with the code's functionality.
