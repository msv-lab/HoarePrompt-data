Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from user input, calculates the square root `x` of `n`, and based on certain conditions, assigns a value to `answr`. If `x^2` is equal to `n`, then `answr` is set to 4 times `x`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, `answr` is calculated as `(x + x + 1) * 2`. If `x * (x + 1)` is less than or equal to `n`, `answr` is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`. The function then prints the integer value of `answr`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific output.**
