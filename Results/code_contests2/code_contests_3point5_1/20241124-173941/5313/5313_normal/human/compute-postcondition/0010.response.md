Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`. If x^2 is equal to n, then `answr` is equal to 4 times the value of x. If x * (x + 1) is greater than n, `answr` is calculated as (x + x + 1) * 2. If x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, `answr` is calculated as 4 * (x + 1).***
