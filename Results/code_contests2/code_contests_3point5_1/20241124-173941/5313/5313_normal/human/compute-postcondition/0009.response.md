Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, x^2 is not equal to n. If the product of x and (x+1) is greater than n, then `answr` is calculated as (x + x + 1) * 2. If the product of x and (x+1) is less than or equal to n, then `answr` is calculated as 4 * (x + 1).***
