Example Answer:
The program prints the value of `answr` which was calculated based on certain conditions using the variables `n` and `x`. Since the specific conditions are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `answr`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`**
