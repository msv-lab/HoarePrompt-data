Example Answer:
The value of `answr` is calculated as 4 times the sum of `x` and 1. Since `x` is the integer square root of `n`, the value of `x` satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the value of `answr` is 4 times the sum of `x` and 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, x^2 is not equal to n, x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, `answr` is 4 times the sum of `x` and 1**
