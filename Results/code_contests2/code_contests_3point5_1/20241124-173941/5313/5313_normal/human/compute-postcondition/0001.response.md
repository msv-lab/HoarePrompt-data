Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the square root of `n` as an integer, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^6. The square root of `n` is calculated and assigned to `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`**
