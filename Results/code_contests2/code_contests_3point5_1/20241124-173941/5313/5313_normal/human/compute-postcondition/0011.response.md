Example Answer: 
The value of `answr` is converted to an integer. The value of `answr` is determined based on the initial values of `n` and `x`. The calculation for `answr` depends on the relationship between `n` and `x`. The final value of `answr` would be an integer value after the conversion.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, `answr` is an integer value calculated based on the conditions mentioned above.**
