Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value `x * 4`, where `x` is the integer square root of `n`. Since the square of `x` is equal to `n`, `answr` will be equal to `n * 4`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, x is the integer square root of n, and answr is 4 times the value of x.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, x is the integer square root of n, and answr is 4 times the value of x**
