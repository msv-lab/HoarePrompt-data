Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`, where `x` is the integer square root of `n` such that x^2 is not equal to n and the product of x and (x+1) is greater than n. Given these conditions, the value of x and x+1 are calculated accordingly, and then `answr` is computed. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, `x^2` is not equal to n, the product of x and (x+1) is greater than n, and `answr` is the result of the calculation `(x + x + 1) * 2`**
