Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is supposed to set levels to the passages so that the highest level of a passage is minimized. However, the code provided does not set any levels to the passages, but rather prints the position of the rightmost 1 bit in the binary representation of `j`. This does not align with the problem description, therefore the code is incorrect.
