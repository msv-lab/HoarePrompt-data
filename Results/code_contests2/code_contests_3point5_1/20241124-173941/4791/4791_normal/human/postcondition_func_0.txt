The function does not accept any parameters and reads an input `n`. It then iterates from `n-1` down to 0, and for each number `j` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, it prints the position of the rightmost 1 bit in the binary representation of `j`. The loop executes only if `n` is between 2 and 499, inclusively. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute.
