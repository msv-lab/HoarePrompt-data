According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498. Since `n` is a non-zero positive integer, we know the loop can execute at least once. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n` by incrementing it by 1.
State: **`n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498, `j` is less than `n`**
