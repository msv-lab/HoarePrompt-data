Example Answer: 
The Python code calculates the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, and then adjusts it by adding 1. The value of `j` is equal to or greater than `n`, so the output state is: `n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498, `j` is equal to or greater than `n`, and the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1` has been adjusted.
Output State: **`n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498, `j` is equal to or greater than `n`, and the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1` has been adjusted**
