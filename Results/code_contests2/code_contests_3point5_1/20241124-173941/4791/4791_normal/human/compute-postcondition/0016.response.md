According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498, and `j` is less than `n`. Additionally, the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1` is important. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted so that it is equal to or greater than `n`, and the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1` needs to be changed.
State: **`n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498, `j` is equal to or greater than `n`, and the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1` needs to be adjusted**
