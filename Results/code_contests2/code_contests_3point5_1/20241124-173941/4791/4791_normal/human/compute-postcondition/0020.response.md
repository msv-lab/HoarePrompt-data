According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a non-zero positive integer. After the loop executes, `n` will remain a positive integer between 1 and 498. If `j` is equal to `n`, the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1` has been adjusted. 
At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498, and the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1` has been adjusted. 
Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **No adjustments needed, `n` remains a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498**
