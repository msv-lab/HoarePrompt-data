Example Answer: 
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of (j + 1), then adds 1 to get the position. Since the initial state mentions `n` but the code snippet uses `j`, assuming `j` is equal to `n`, the output will be the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of (n + 1). The output state is not affected by this code, so:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499**
