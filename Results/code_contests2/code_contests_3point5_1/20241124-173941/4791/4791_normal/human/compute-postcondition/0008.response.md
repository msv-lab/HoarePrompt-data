According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 2 and 501. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be equal to `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 501, `j` is equal to `n`**
