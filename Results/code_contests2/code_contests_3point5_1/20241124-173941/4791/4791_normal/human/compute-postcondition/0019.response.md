Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute n times. After the loop executes, n remains a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498. If j is equal to n, the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of j + 1 has been adjusted. If n is 0, the loop does not execute.**
