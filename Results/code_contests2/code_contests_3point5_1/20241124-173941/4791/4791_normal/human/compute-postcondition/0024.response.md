According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 497. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to one more than the previous value of `n`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 497, `j` is equal to the previous value of `n` + 1**
