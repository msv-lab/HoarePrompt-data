Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit (1-bit) in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot calculate the exact output. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498.
Output State: **`n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498**
