Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`. The binary representation of `j + 1` is reversed and the index of the first '1' encountered is found. The result is then incremented by 1 to get the position of the rightmost '1'. Since `j` is less than `n`, the value of `j` can range from 0 to n-1. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498, `j` is less than `n`, and the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498, `j` is less than `n`, and the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`**
