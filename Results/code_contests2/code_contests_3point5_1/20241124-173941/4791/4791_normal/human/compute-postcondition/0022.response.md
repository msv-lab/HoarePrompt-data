According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being decreased by 1 means that the adjusted state should be `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 498. Since `n` is a non-zero positive integer, after being decreased by 1, it will still be a positive integer. Therefore, the adjusted state should be `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 497.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 497**
