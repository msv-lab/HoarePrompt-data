According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 497, `j` is equal to the updated value of `n` + 2. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n+1`. Since `j` is equal to `n+2`, it needs to be adjusted to `n+1`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 497, `j` is equal to `n+1`**
