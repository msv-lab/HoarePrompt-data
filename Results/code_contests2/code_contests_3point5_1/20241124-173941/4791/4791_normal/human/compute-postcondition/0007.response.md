Example Answer: 
The code calculates the binary representation of `j + 1`, reverses it, finds the position of the first '1' from the right, and then adds 1 to get the final result. Since the initial state is `n` is an integer between 2 and 501, and `j` is not defined, the specific value cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 501.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 501**
