According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is given as a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498, the loop will always execute. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are needed for the loop to execute.
State: **`n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498**
