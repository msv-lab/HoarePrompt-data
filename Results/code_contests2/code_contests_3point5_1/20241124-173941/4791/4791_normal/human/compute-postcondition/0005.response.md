Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`, then adds 1 to the result. The value of `n` does not change, as it is not used in the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 500.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 500**
