Example Answer:
The value of `j` is assigned to the previous value of `n` + 1. Then the program prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is equal to `n + 1`, the binary representation of `j + 1` will have the same rightmost set bit as `n + 2`. Therefore, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n + 2` is calculated, and 1 is added to it as the indexing is 0-based. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 497, `j` is equal to the previous value of `n` + 1, and the program prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n + 2`.**
