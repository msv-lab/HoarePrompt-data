According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498, `j` is equal to or greater than `n`, and the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1` has been adjusted. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 498, `j` is less than `n`, and the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1` has been adjusted**
