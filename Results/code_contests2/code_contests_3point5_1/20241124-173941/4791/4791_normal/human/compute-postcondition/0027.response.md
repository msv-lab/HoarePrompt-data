Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `n` + 2, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 497. The value of `j` can range from 3 to 499. The code then prints the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`. 
For example, if `j + 1` in binary is 0b11011, the rightmost '1' is at position 2 (from the right) since the index starts from 0. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 497, `j` is equal to the updated value of `n` + 2, and the code prints the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 497, `j` is equal to the updated value of `n` + 2, and the code prints the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`**
