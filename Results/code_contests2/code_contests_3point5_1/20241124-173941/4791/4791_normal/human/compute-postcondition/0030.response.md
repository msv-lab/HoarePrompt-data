According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 497, and `j` is equal to the current value of `n` + 1. To execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to a positive integer between 1 and 496, and `j` should be adjusted accordingly to the new value of `n` + 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 496, `j` is equal to the new value of `n` + 1**
