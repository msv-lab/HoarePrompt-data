Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. The value of `j` is not given, so the exact position cannot be determined. The output will be the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 497**
