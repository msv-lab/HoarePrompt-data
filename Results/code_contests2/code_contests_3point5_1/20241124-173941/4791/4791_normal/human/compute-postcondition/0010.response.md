According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a non-zero positive integer. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` will be an integer between 1 and 499. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to a non-zero positive integer. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is a non-zero positive integer between 1 and 499**
