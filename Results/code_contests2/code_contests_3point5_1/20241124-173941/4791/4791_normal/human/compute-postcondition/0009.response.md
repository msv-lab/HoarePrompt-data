Output State: **The loop processes each number from 1 to n and prints the position of the rightmost 1 bit in the binary representation of the number. If n is between 1 and 499, the loop will execute at least once. If n is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute. After the loop finishes, n will be an integer between 1 and 499.**
