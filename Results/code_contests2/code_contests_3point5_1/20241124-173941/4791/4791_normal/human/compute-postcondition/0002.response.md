According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being an integer between 1 and 499 ensures that the loop will execute. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499**
