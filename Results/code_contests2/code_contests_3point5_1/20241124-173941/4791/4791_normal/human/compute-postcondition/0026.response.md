According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 497, and `j` is equal to the previous value of `n` + 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than the updated value of `n`. Therefore, `j` should be set to the updated value of `n` + 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 497, `j` is equal to the updated value of `n` + 2**
