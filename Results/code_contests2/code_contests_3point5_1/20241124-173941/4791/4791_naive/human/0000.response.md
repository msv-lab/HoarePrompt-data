Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly set the levels to the passages as required by the problem description. The logic used in the provided code is not aligned with the problem requirements. The output generated by the code does not ensure that the number of times we pass through a passage is always even when leaving and returning to a room.

Example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
3

Expected Output:
1 1
1

Actual Output:
1

In the expected output, the levels of the passages are set to 1, which ensures that the number of times we pass through a passage is always even when leaving and returning to a room. However, the actual output generated by the code does not meet this requirement.
