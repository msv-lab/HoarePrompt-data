According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. In this case, the loop continues to calculate the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of each number from 1 to n. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
