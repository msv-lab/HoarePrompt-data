According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, the output of the print statement is 1. Since the output of the print statement is 1, it means the loop executed at least once. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, the output of the print statement is 1**
