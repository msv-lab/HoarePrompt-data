Example Answer:
The value of `j + 1` is 2, which is converted to binary as '10'. Reversing it gives '01'. Finding the index of '1' in this reversed binary string gives 0, but since indexing starts from 0, we add 1 to get the final result of 1. The output of the print statement is 1, but the variables `n` and `j` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 1**
