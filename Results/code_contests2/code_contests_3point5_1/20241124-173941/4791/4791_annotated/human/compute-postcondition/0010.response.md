According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is at least 1. Since n is at least 1, it ensures that the loop will execute again, so no states need to be adjusted.
State: **The loop calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to n. If n is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once**
