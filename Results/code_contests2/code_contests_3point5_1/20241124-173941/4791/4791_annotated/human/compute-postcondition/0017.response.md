Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 2, `j + 1` is 3, which in binary is '11'. Reversing the binary representation gives '11', and finding the position of the rightmost '1' gives 1. Therefore, the output state is `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, the output of the print statement is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, the output of the print statement is 1**
