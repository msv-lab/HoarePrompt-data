Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` is 2, which in binary is `10`. The rightmost set bit is at position 2 (from the right), so the output of the code is 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
