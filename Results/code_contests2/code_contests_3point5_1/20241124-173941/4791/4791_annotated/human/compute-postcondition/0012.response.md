According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is decremented by 1 before the loop starts, it means the original value of `n` was at least 1. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to set `n` to be greater than 0 and `j` to be 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
