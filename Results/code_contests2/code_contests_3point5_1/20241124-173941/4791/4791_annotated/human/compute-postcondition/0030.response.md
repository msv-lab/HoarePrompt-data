According to the code, the loop will execute as long as 'n' is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, 'n' is greater than 0 and 'j' is at least 2. This means to execute the loop one more time, 'n' needs to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **'n' is greater than 1, 'j' is at least 2, and the output of the code is 1**
