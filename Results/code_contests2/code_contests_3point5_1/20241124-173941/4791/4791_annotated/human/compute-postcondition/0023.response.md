Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j + 1. Since j is 0, j + 1 is 1, which is represented as '1' in binary. The rightmost set bit is at position 0 (from the right), so the code returns 1. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**. The code returns 1.
