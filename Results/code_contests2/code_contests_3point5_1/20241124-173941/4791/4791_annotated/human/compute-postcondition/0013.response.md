Example Answer: 
`j` is incremented by 1, then converted to binary format and reversed. The index of the first occurrence of '1' is found, and 1 is added to it. Since `j` is 0 initially, `j + 1` is 1 in binary, which reversed is still 1. The index of '1' is 0, so 1 is added to it, resulting in 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1**
