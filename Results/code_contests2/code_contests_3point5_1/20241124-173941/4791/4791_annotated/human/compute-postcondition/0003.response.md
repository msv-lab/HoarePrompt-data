Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1, then `j + 1` is converted to binary, reversed, and the index of the first '1' is found, incremented by 1, and printed. Since `j` was 0, `j + 1` is 1, which in binary is '1'. Reversing '1' gives '1', and the index of the first '1' is 0. Incrementing by 1, the final output is 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
