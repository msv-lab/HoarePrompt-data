According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is 3. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and should be less than `n`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4, and the function returns 1**
