According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2. Since `j` is less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, and the function returns 1**
