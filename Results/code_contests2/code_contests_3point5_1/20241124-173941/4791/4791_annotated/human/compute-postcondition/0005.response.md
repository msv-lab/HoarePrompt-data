Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`. 
- `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3, which in binary is '11'.
- Reversing '11' gives '11'.
- Finding the position of '1' from the right gives 1.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and the function returns 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and the function returns 1**
