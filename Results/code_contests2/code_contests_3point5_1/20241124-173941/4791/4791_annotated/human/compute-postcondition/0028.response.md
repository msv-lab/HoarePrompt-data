According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3 since it should be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, and the output of the code is 1**
