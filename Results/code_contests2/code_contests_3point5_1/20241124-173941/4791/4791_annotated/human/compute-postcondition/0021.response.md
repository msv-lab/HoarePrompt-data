Example Answer:
The value of `n` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Since `n` represents the numbers from 1 to n where n is greater than 0, the loop will continue until n becomes 0. The loop calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of each number from 1 to n. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop continues to calculate the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of each number from 1 to n where n is greater than 0.
Output State: **The loop continues to calculate the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of each number from 1 to n where n is greater than 0**
