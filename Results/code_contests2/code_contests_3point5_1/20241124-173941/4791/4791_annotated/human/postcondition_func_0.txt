The function reads an input from the user, decrements the input value in a while loop until it reaches 0, and then iterates through a range based on the decremented value. For each iteration, it prints the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of the current number. The function does not explicitly return any value. There is a potential issue with the code where 'n' is being decremented, but it is being used as the stopping condition for the while loop, leading to an infinite loop if 'n' is not properly handled.
