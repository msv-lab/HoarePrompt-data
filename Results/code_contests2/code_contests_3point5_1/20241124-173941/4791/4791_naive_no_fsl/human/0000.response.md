Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly set levels to the passages as required by the problem description. The logic used in the program to determine the level of the passage connecting Room i and Room j does not ensure that the number of times we pass through a passage is always even when leaving Room i, passing through some passages whose levels are all equal, and getting back to Room i. 

An example of the incorrect output for N=3:
The program output for N=3 could be:
```
1 2
1
```
This output does not satisfy the condition that the number of times we pass through a passage is always even when leaving Room i, passing through some passages whose levels are all equal, and getting back to Room i. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
