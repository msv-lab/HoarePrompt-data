Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program takes the input of the number of coins each player has at the end of the game, calculates the sum of all coins, and then checks if the sum is divisible by the number of players. If it is, it prints the result of dividing the sum by the number of players, which represents the initial bet each player made. If the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of players, it prints -1.

The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It handles the condition where the sum of coins is not zero and is divisible by the number of players. The logic of dividing the sum by the number of players to find the initial bet is valid. Additionally, it correctly outputs -1 if there is no valid initial bet value.

Therefore, the program is correct for all cases and meets the requirements of the problem description.
