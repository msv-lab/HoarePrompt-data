Example Answer:
The code checks if the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` is equal to 0 or if it is divisible by 5 (length of the list). If either condition is met, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the average of the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5`. Since the values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are non-negative integers and their sum is stored in `s`, the output state is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5`, and the code does not affect the state.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5`**
