Example Answer:
The values in the input are split and converted into integers by using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since the initial state of variables c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are unknown, after execution, the values of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100 with the values obtained from the input.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100 with values obtained from the input**
