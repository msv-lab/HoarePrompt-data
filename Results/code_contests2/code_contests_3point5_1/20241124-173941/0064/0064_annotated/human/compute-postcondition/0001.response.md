Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the sum of all the values in the list `c`. Since the values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are non-negative integers ranging from 0 to 100, the sum of these values can range from 0 to 500. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100 with values obtained from the input, and `s` is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100 with values obtained from the input, and `s` is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5**
