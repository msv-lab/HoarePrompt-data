Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the sum of coins held by all players and checks if this sum is divisible by the number of players. If the sum is not zero and is divisible by the number of players, then it calculates and prints the initial bet amount. If the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of players, it prints -1. 
For all possible inputs within the given constraints (0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100), the program correctly follows the problem description and provides the expected output.
