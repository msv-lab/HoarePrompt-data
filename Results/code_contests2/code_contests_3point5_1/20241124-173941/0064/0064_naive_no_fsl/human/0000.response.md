Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input of the number of coins each player has at the end of the game, calculates the total sum of coins, and then checks if the total sum is divisible by the number of players. If the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of players, it outputs -1, indicating that there is no valid initial bet value. Otherwise, it calculates and outputs the initial bet value.

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. There are no scenarios identified where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
