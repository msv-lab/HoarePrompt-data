Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads five integers from the user input, calculates the sum of those integers, and then prints either -1 if the sum is 0 or not divisible by 5 (number of integers entered), or the result of the division of the sum by 5. This aligns with the problem description that states to find the size of the initial bet or determine if such an outcome is not possible for any positive number of coins in the initial bet. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints align with the code logic. There are no edge cases found where the code does not work as expected.
