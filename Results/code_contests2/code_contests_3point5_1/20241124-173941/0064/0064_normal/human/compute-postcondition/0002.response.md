Example Answer:
The code checks if the sum of integers in list c is equal to 0 or not divisible evenly by the length of list c. If either condition is met, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the average of the integers in list c and prints it. The initial state includes list c of integers and the sum of all integers in list c stored in variable s. Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state.
Output State: **c is a list of integers, s is the sum of all integers in list c**
