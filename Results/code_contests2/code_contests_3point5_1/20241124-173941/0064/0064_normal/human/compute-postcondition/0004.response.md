Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads integers from the user input, calculates the sum of those integers, and then prints either -1 if the sum is 0 or not divisible by the number of integers entered, or the result of the division of the sum by the count of integers entered. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
