Output State: **`a` is an integer, `c` is either 0 or 1. If the user input `a` is odd, then `a` is updated to `a - 9` and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, there is no change in `a` or `c`. The code prints -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11); otherwise, it prints `a / 4 + c`. If q is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `a` remains the user input, and `c` is 0.**
