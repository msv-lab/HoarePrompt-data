Example Answer:
If `a` is odd, it is decremented by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, there is no change in the values of `a` and `c`. Then, the code checks if `a` is in the list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If `a` is in the list, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates `a / 4 + c` and prints the result. 
Output State: **`a` is an integer, `c` is either 0 or 1, and the output is the result of the print statement based on the conditions mentioned above.**
