Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, so after execution, `c` is now 1. The value of `a` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is 1, `a` has been updated by subtracting 9.
Output State: **`c` is 1, `a` has been updated by subtracting 9**
