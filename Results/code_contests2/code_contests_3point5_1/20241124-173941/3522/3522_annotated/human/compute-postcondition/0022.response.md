According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value returned by the `input()` function. If the input is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is an integer and `c` is either 0 or 1. Since the loop is executed at least once, the input value must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is an integer, `c` is either 0 or 1, and the input value is greater than or equal to 2**
