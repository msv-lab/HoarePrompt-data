Example Answer: 
`a` is updated by subtracting 9 from its previous value, and the updated value depends on whether the previous value was odd or even. The value of `c` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the updated user input (if odd), `c` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is the updated user input (if odd), `c` is 0**
