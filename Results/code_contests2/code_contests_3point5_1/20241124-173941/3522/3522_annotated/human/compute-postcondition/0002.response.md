Example Answer: 
After the execution of the code, variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The value of variable `a` is assigned the user input, but the input value is not specified. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is assigned the user input, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is assigned the user input, `c` is 0**
