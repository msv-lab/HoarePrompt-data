Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the user input. If the user input is odd, `a` will be updated to that odd value, and `c` will be updated to an integer. If the user input is even, `a` will remain the same as the user input, and `c` will not be updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the user input (updated if odd), `c` is an integer (updated if `a` is odd).
Output State: **`a` is the user input (updated if odd), `c` is an integer (updated if `a` is odd)**
