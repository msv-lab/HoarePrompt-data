Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values, adjusts them based on certain conditions, and outputs a specific value calculated from the input. If the input value is odd, it subtracts 9 and sets a flag `c` to 1. It then prints -1 if the adjusted value is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11); otherwise, it prints the adjusted value divided by 4 plus the flag `c`. If the input value is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
