According to the code, the loop will execute based on the user input. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is the user input and `c` is an integer. If `a` is odd, `a` is updated to the user input - 9 and `c` is set to 1. The code prints -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints the result of `a / 4 + c.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions:
1. If `a` is odd, then `a` should be updated to the user input - 9 and `c` should be set to 1.
2. If `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then the loop will not execute again.
3. Otherwise, the loop will execute again with the updated values of `a` and `c`.

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`a` is the user input (updated if odd), `c` is an integer (updated if `a` is odd)**
