According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value returned by the `input()` function, which must be a non-negative integer. The loop will execute that many times. Since `q` is a positive integer, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `q` is a positive integer.
State: **Precondition**: **q is a positive integer. Each ni is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9, `q` is a positive integer**
