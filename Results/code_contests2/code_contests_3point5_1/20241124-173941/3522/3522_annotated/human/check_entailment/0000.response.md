Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It handles odd numbers by subtracting 9 and setting `c` to 1, in order to maximize the number of summands. It correctly prints -1 for numbers less than any composite number. It calculates the maximum possible number of summands for even numbers using `a / 4 + c` formula. The program covers all scenarios mentioned in the problem description and works correctly for all given examples.
