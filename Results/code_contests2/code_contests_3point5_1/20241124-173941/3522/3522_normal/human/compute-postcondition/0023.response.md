Output State: **After the loop executes, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 10^9. `a` is an integer where if `a` was originally odd, then `a` is decremented by 9, and `c` is set to 1. If `a` was originally even, `a` remains unchanged, and `c` remains 0. The code prints -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints the result of `a` divided by 4 plus `c`. If `q` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `a` remains a string, and `c` is 0.**
