Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 0. `q` is a positive integer and `a` is an input string. No variables are affected by the current code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 10^9, `a` is an input string, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 10^9, `a` is an input string, `c` is 0**
