Functionality: **The function `func` reads a positive integer `q` from the input. It then reads `q` integers and for each integer `a`, it decrements `a` by 9 if `a` is odd and sets `c` to 1. If `a` is even, `c` remains 0. The function then prints -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11); otherwise, it prints the result of `a` divided by 4 plus `c`. If `q` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the original input values remain unchanged.**
