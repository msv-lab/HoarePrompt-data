The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function only executes and returns the result. The function performs the following:
- The function reads a positive integer `q` from the input.
- The function then reads `q` positive integers `ni` from the input and stores them.
- For each `ni` value, the function checks if it is a perfect square. If `ni` is a perfect square, the function prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read a positive integer `q`, followed by `q` positive integers. For each positive integer, it checks if it is a perfect square and prints the corresponding output "YES" or "NO".
