Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 10^9, `a` is an input string - 9 if `a` was originally odd, and `c` is 1. If `a` was already even, no changes are made to `a` and `c` remains 0, and the result is printed as -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else the result of `a` divided by 4 plus `c`.**
