Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `c` was `0`, so after execution, `c` is `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer, `a` is an even number, `c` is 1.
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `a` is an even number, `c` is 1**
