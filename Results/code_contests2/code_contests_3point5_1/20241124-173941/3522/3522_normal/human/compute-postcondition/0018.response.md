Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of `a - 9`. If `a` was originally odd, then `a - 9` would result in an even number. `q` remains as a positive integer, and `c` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer, `a` is an even number, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `a` is an even number, `c` is 0**
