Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the input, which is a string. The value of `q` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 10^9, `a` is a string.
Output State: **Precondition: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 10^9, `a` is a string**
