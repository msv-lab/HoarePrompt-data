Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 10^9, `a` is an integer. If `a` was originally odd, then `a` is decremented by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` was originally even, then `a` remains unchanged and `c` remains 0. The code prints -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints `a` divided by 4 plus `c`.**
