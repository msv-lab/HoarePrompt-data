Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 10^9, `a` is a string. If the remainder of `a` divided by 2 is not 0, then `a` is decremented by 9 and `c` is set to 1. In all other cases, `c` remains 0. The code prints -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else it prints `a` divided by 4 plus `c`.**
