Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the number of queries `q` and then reads `q` integers representing the queries.
- For each query `a`, the code decrements `a` by 9 if it is odd and sets `c` to 1, or keeps `c` as 0 if `a` is even.
- It then checks if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) and prints -1 if it is, which aligns with the fact that 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 cannot be split into composite summands.
- For other values of `a`, it calculates the maximum number of composite summands by dividing `a` by 4 and adding `c`, which is also in line with the problem description.
- The code correctly handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the output hints are consistent with the code logic.
