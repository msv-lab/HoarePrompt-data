Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes the input of the number of ingredients, the volume of the pan, the proportions of the ingredients, and the available amount of each ingredient. It then calculates the maximum volume of soup that can be cooked based on the available ingredients and the proportions. The program uses reduce and zip functions to perform the necessary calculations. The output is the volume of soup that can be cooked. The program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and provides the expected output for the given examples.
