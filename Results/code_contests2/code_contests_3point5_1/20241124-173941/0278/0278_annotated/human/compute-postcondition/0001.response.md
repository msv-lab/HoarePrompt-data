Example Answer: 
`a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input provided using `raw_input()`. The values are converted to float and stored in lists `a` and `b`. The initial states of `n` and `V` are input integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `V` are input integers, `a` and `b` are lists of float values.
Output State: **`n` and `V` are input integers, `a` and `b` are lists of float values**
