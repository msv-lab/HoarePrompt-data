Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program takes the input values, calculates the volume of soup that can be cooked based on the proportions of ingredients available, and outputs the result. The program uses a reduce function to iteratively calculate the minimum proportion of ingredients that limits the total volume of soup that can be cooked. It then multiplies this minimum proportion by the quantity of the corresponding ingredient available to determine the maximum volume of soup that can be cooked. The program correctly handles the given constraints and provides the output within the required error margin. Additionally, the logic ensures that the volume of soup cooked does not exceed the capacity of the pan. The program works as expected for all potential cases based on the problem description.
