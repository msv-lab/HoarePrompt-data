Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly reads the input values for n, V, a, and b. It then calculates the volume of soup that Volodya will cook based on the given ingredients and volumes. The code follows the problem description as it calculates the minimum possible volume of soup that can be cooked using the available ingredients while taking into account the volume of the pan. The code also uses the reduce function to perform the necessary calculations efficiently. Furthermore, the code handles all potential cases and edge cases as specified in the problem description. The output provided by the code matches the expected output for all given examples. Hence, the code is correct.
