Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the logic to find the least super lucky number that is not less than n. It iterates through possible lengths of super lucky numbers, generates all combinations of '4' and '7' for that length, checks if the count of '4' and '7' is equal, converts the combination to an integer, and then compares it with n to find the minimum super lucky number that is not less than n. The code covers all possible cases and produces the correct output.
