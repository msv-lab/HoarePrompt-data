Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, i is the next even number greater than the previous value, l remains unchanged, x is unchanged. The count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, tem is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in x. If tem is greater than or equal to n, then ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and tem. This ensures that the final state of the program variables guarantees the conditions specified in the precondition are satisfied, and the minimum value of ans is correctly updated based on the comparison with tem.***
