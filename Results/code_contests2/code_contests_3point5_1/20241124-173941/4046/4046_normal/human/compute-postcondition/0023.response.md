According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more iterations possible based on the value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, and the count of '7' in `x` is not equal to the count of '4', `tem` is assigned the integer value of `x`. After the execution of the if statement, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. `l`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` should be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, count of '7' in `x` is not equal to the count of '4', `tem` is assigned the integer value of `x`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged, `i` is increased by 1**
