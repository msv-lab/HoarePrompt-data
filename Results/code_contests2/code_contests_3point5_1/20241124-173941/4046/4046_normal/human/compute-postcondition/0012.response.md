Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `l` is the length of the string representation of n + 1 if the length of the string representation of n is odd, otherwise `l` remains the same as the length of the string representation of `n`. `ans` is 4444477777, `l` is less than 10, `i` is greater than or equal to 1. In the given code fragment, if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then `tem` is assigned the integer value of the concatenated string `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. This logic ensures that `ans` will hold the minimum value between its current value and `tem` whenever the count of '7' is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
