Postcondition: ***`n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then `tem` is assigned the integer value of `x` after joining the elements. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. All variables retain their initial positive integer values after the execution of the if-else block, covering all edge cases and scenarios.***
