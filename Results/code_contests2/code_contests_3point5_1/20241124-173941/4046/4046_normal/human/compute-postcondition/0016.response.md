Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. After the execution of the if statement, if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the original `ans` and `tem`. `l` remains unchanged, `i` stays the same as the last iteration, and `tem` holds the integer value obtained by concatenating the elements of list `x`. If the condition is not met, the variables retain their initial values as mentioned in the precondition.***
