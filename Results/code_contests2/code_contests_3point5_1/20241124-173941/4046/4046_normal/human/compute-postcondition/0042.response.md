Postcondition: ***`n`, `i+1`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then `tem` is assigned the integer value of the concatenation of characters in `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`.***
