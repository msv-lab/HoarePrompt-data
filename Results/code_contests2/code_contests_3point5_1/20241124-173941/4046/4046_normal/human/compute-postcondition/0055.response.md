Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The previous values of `ans` and `tem` are positive integers. If `tem` is less than `ans`, then `ans` will be updated to `tem`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, and `ans` are positive integers, where `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `tem`.
Output State: **`n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, and `ans` are positive integers, where `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `tem`**
