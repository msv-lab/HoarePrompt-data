Postcondition: ***`n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4', `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. The variables `n`, `i`, `l`, `x` remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
