Example Answer: 
`tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in the string `x`. The value of `x` is not given, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `tem`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers, updated based on the next iteration conditions.
Output State: **`n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers, updated based on the next iteration conditions**
