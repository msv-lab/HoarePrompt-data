Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next even number greater than the previous value, `l` remains unchanged, `x` is unchanged. If the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, then tem is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in x. If tem is greater than or equal to n, ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and tem. This ensures that after the execution of the if block, the program variables maintain the initial conditions and the minimum value of ans is correctly updated based on the comparison with tem, covering all relevant edge cases.***
