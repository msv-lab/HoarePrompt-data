Example Answer:
The length of the string representation of `n` is calculated and stored in `l`. The value of `ans` is set to 4444477777. Since the value of `n` can be any positive integer, the length of its string representation can vary. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), l is the length of the string representation of n, ans is 4444477777.
Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), l is the length of the string representation of n, ans is 4444477777**
