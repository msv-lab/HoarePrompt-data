Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. After the execution of the if statement, if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4', `tem` is set to the integer value obtained by concatenating the elements of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the original `ans` and `tem`. `l` remains unchanged, `i` stays the same as the last iteration, and `x` is unchanged. If the count of '7' does not match the count of '4', all variables retain their initial values as stated in the precondition.***
