Output State: 
If the loop executes, `n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers. 
The loop iterates over all possible combinations of '7' and '4' of length `i`. For each combination, if the count of '7' is equal to the count of '4', the integer value of the combination is calculated as `tem`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. `l` remains unchanged, `i` stays the same as the last iteration, and `x` is unchanged. 
If the loop does not execute, all variables retain their initial values as stated in the precondition.
