Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. Since all variables are positive integers, `ans` will be updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and the integer representation of the concatenated string of `x`. 
Output State: **`n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers, `tem` is the integer representation of the concatenated string of `x`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`**
