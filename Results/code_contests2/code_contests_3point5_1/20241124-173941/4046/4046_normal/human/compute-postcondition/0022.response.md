Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. If the count of '7' in `x` is not equal to the count of '4', `tem` is assigned the integer value of `x`. After the execution of the if statement, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. `l`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.***
