Example Answer:
The variable `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of list `x` as a string and then converting it to an integer. All variables are positive integers, and after joining `x`, the integer value of `tem` is determined. Therefore, the Output State is: n, i+1, l, x, tem, ans are positive integers.
Output State: **n, i+1, l, x, tem, ans are positive integers**
