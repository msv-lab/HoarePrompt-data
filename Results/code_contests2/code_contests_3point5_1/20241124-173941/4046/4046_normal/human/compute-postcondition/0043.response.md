According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `x`, `tem`, `ans`, and the condition regarding the count of '7' and '4' in `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `i+1`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. The count of '7' in `x` must be equal to the count of '4' in `x`.
2. If the above condition is met, `tem` should be assigned the integer value of the concatenation of characters in `x`.
3. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` should be updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`.

State: **`n`, `i+1`, `l`, `x` with the required conditions, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers.**
