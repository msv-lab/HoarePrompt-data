Postcondition: ***`n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then the integer `tem` is created by joining the digits of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `tem`. If the count of '7' is not equal to the count of '4', or if `tem` is less than `n`, all variables remain unchanged.***
