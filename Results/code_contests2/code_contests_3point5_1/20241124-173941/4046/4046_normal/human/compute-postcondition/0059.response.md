Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string representation and then joined together to form a single string. This string is then converted back to an integer and assigned to `tem`. The previous values of `x` determine the resulting value of `tem`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers, `tem` is the integer representation of the concatenated string of `x`.
Output State: **`n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers, `tem` is the integer representation of the concatenated string of `x`**
