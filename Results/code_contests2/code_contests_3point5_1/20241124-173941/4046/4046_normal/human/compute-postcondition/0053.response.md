According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `x`, `tem`, and `ans`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then `tem` is assigned the integer value of `x` after joining the elements. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- If the count of '7' in the next `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the next `x`, then `tem` must be updated accordingly based on the new `x`.
- If the new `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` should be updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and the new `tem`.

State: **`n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers, updated based on the next iteration conditions**
