Postcondition: ***`n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers. If the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4', then `tem` is set to the integer representation of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
