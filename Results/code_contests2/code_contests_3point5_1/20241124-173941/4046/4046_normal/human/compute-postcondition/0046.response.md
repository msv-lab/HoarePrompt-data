According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers does not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `i` is greater than 0 and updated to the next value where `i < 10`. 
State: **`n`, `i` is updated to the next value where `i < 10`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers**
