Postcondition: ***`n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers. The count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x. `tem` is assigned the integer value of `x` after joining the elements. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`.***
