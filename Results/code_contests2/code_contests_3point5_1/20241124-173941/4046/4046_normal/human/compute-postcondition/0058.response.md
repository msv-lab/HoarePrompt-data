According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `x`, `tem`, `ans`, and the conditions related to the counts of '7' and '4' in `x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, all variables are positive integers. The conditions are met if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.

1. If the count of '7' is not equal to the count of '4', or if `tem` is less than `n`, all variables remain unchanged. 
2. If the count of '7' is equal to the count of '4' in `x` and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `tem`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `ans` if the conditions are met in the loop body.
State: **`n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers**.
