Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The values of `ans` and `tem` are positive integers, so the new value of `ans` will be the smaller of the two positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `i+1`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers and `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`.
Output State: **`n`, `i+1`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers and `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem**`
