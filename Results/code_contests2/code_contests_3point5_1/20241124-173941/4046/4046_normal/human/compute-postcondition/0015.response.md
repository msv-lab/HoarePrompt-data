Example Answer:
The minimum value between `ans` and `tem` is assigned back to `ans`. The value of `ans` is 4444477777, and the value of `tem` is calculated by joining the elements of list `x`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, updated `l` based on the new value of `n`, `ans` is the minimum between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is the same as the last iteration, and `tem` is the integer value obtained by joining the elements of list `x`**
