According to the code, the loop can execute again if the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4'. At the end of the last iteration, the variables are all positive integers. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` should be equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in order to set `tem` to the integer representation of `x`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:
State: **`n`, `i`, `l`, `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers, number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4'.**
