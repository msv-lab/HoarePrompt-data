According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and the range specified (from `l` to 10 with a step size of 2). If `l` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a positive integer. So for the loop to execute one more time, `l` should be adjusted to the next value in the range defined in the loop statement (incremented by 2). No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `i`, `l` (adjusted to the next value in the range), `x`, `tem`, `ans` are positive integers**
