Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description. It takes an integer input `n`, calculates the length of its string representation `l`, increments `l` if the length is odd, and then iterates through combinations of '7' and '4' of increasing lengths starting from `l` up to 10. For each combination, it checks if the count of '7' is equal to the count of '4', calculates the integer value `tem`, and updates `ans` to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

The output hints also align with the code by explaining the process of finding the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to `n`. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each input. Thus, the code is correct.
