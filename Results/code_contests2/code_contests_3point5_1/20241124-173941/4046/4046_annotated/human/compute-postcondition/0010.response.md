Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. Since `tem` is an integer obtained from converting the string `x`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of `tem` will be greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be the minimum value between `4444477777` and `n`, which will be `n` if `n` is less than `4444477777` and `4444477777` otherwise. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is within the range [10, 12, 14, ...], `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `4444477777`, `i` is equal to `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
