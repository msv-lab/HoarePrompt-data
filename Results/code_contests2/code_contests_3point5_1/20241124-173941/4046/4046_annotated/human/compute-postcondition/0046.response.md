According to the code, the loop can execute if i is at least 3. The loop iterates over the product of '74' repeated i times, so the loop executes for all possible combinations of '7' and '4' of length i. Since the counts of '7' and '4' in x are equal for the selected combination, the loop can execute for a particular combination only if the count of '7' and '4' is equal in that combination. Before the loop starts, if n is at least 12, ans is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of ans and the valid tem if applicable. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is at least 12, `ans` updated to the minimum value between the initial value of ans and the valid tem if applicable, `i` is at least 3, counts of '7' and '4' in x are equal for the selected combination**
