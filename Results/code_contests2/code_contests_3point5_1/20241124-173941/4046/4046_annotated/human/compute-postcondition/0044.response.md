Output State: 
If n is greater than or equal to 12, the loop will execute at least once. For each iteration, the loop checks if the counts of '7' and '4' in x are equal. If they are equal, tem is created by converting x to an integer. If tem is greater than or equal to n, ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and tem. The loop continues incrementing i until the condition is met. 
If n is less than 12, the loop does not execute. 
Output State: **If n is at least 12, ans is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of ans and the valid tem if applicable. i is at least 1, counts of '7' and '4' in x are equal for the selected combination. If n is less than 12, the loop does not execute.**
