Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, l belongs to the set [12, 14, 16, ...], ans is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of ans and tem if tem is greater than or equal to n. Additionally, i is increased by 1, the counts of '7' and '4' in x are equal for the new combination, and tem is recalculated based on the new combination of elements in list x. If tem is greater than or equal to n, ans is updated to the minimum of ans and tem.***
