According to the code, the loop can execute again if the conditions specified are met. At the end of the last iteration, the following states were observed: n is a positive integer, l belongs to the set [12, 14, 16, ...], i is increased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the conditions for creating `tem` must be met. This means the count of '7' in x must be equal to the count of '4' in x. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes again, the count of '7' and '4' in the next value of x must be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, if tem is greater than or equal to n, then ans needs to be updated to the minimum value between ans and tem. 

State: **n is a positive integer, l belongs to the set [12, 14, 16, ...], i is increased by 1. The count of '7' in x must be equal to the count of '4' in x. If tem is greater than or equal to n, ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and tem.**
