Output State: 
- If `n` is less than 74, the variables remain in their initial state and no changes occur.
- If `n` is at least 74 and the loop iterates through all possible combinations of '7' and '4' of length `i`, updating `ans` accordingly to the minimum value that satisfies the conditions mentioned.
- After the loop execution, `n` remains a positive integer, `l` belongs to the set [10, 12, 14, ...], `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `i` is adjusted accordingly, and the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal for the selected combination.
- The final output is the value of `ans` printed.
Output State: **The final output is the value of `ans` printed**
