According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition specified is met. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- The value of i needs to be increased by 1.
- The value of tem needs to be calculated based on the new combination of elements in list x.
- If the count of '7' and '4' in the new combination of x remains equal, update the tem and ans accordingly.
State: **n is a positive integer, l belongs to the set [12, 14, 16, ...], ans is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of ans and tem if applicable, i is increased by 1, counts of '7' and '4' in x are equal for the new combination, tem is recalculated based on the new combination of elements in list x**
