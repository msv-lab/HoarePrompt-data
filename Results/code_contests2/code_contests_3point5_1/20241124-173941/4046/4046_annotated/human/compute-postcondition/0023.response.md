According to the code, the loop can execute again depending on the value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states were noted: `n` is a positive integer, `l` belongs to the set [10, 12, 14, ...], `ans` remains the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by the value of `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is one more than the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is an integer obtained by converting the string `x` to an integer. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` after the if statement, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the initial `ans` and `tem`. In all other cases, including when the counts of '7' and '4' are not equal or `tem` is less than `n`, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the only state that needs adjustment is `i`, which should be incremented by the value of `l`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` belongs to the set [10, 12, 14, ...], `ans` remains the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by the value of `l + l`, the count of '7' in `x` is one more than the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is an integer obtained by converting the string `x` to an integer.**
