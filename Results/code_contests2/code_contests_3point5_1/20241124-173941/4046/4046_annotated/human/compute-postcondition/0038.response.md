According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer and `l` belongs to the set [12, 14, 16, ...]. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1.

State: **n is a positive integer, l belongs to the set [12, 14, 16, ...], i is increased by 1**
