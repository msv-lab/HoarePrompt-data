According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the range defined by `l` and 10 with a step of 2. If `n` is at least 12, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `n` is at least 12, ans is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of ans and the valid tem if applicable. Also, `i` is at least 1. If n is less than 12, the loop does not execute. 
So, for the loop to execute one more time, the condition of `n` being at least 12 needs to be maintained and `i` needs to be incremented by the step size, which is 2 in this case.
State: **If n is at least 12, ans is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of ans and the valid tem if applicable, i is at least 3, counts of '7' and '4' in x are equal for the selected combination.**
