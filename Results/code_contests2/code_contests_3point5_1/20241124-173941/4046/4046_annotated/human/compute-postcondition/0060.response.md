Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The previous values of `ans` and `tem` are not provided, so the output state is: `n` is at least 12, `ans` is updated based on certain conditions, `i` is at least 4, the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are not equal for the selected combination, `tem` is an integer value based on the elements in `x`.
Output State: **`n` is at least 12, `ans` is updated based on certain conditions, `i` is at least 4, the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are not equal for the selected combination, `tem` is an integer value based on the elements in `x`**
