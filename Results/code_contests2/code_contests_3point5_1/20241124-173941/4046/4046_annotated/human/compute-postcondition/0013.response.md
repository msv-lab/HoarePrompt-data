According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and the loop condition. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is within the range [10, 12, 14, ...], `ans` remains the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` remains equal to `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is an integer obtained by converting the string `x` to an integer.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by the value of `l`.
- `x` should be such that the count of '7' is equal to the count of '4' plus 1 in `x`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is within the range [10, 12, 14, ...], `ans` remains the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by the value of `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is one more than the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is an integer obtained by converting the string `x` to an integer.**
