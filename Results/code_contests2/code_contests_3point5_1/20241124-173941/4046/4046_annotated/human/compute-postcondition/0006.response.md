According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is equal to `l`. The loop depends on the variable `i`. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer and `l` is within the range [10, 12, 14, ...]. So, for the loop to execute, `i` should be equal to `l`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` is equal to `l`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is within the range [10, 12, 14, ...], `ans` remains 4444477777 after the execution of the if statement, `i` is equal to `l`**
