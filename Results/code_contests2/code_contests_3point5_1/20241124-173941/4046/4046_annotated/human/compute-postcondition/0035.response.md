Example Answer: 
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` and `tem`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, l belongs to the set [12, 14, 16, ...], i is increased by 1, counts of '7' and '4' in x are equal for the new combination, tem is recalculated based on the new combination of elements in list x.
