Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is within the range [10, 12, 14, ...], `ans` remains the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` remains equal to `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is an integer obtained by converting the string `x` to an integer.***
