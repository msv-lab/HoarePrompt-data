Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` and the value of `tem`. The value of `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, so `ans` will be updated to `n` if `n` is less than the initial value of `ans`. Other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n` is at least 12, ans updated to the minimum value between the initial value of ans and n, i is at least 3, counts of '7' and '4' in x are equal for the selected combination, the count of '7' and '4' in x are equal, tem is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in x, the value of tem is greater than or equal to n**
