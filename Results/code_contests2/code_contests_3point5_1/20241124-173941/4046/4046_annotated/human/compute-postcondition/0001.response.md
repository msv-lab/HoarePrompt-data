Example Answer:
The length of the string representation of `n` is calculated and stored in `l`. The value of `ans` is set to 4444477777. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is 4444477777.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is 4444477777**
