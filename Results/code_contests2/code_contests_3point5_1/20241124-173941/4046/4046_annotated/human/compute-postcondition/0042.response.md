Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, l belongs to the set [12, 14, 16, ...], i is increased by 1. If the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, then tem is created by converting x to an integer. If tem is greater than or equal to n, ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and tem. No changes occur if tem is less than n.***
