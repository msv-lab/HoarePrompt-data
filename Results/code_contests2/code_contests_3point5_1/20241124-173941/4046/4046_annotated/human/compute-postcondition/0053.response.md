According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the product of '74' repeated `i` times. If the product of '74' repeated `i` times has not been exhausted, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 12, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is at least 3, counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal for the selected combination. If the count of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the product of '74' repeated `i+1` times should not be exhausted. This means that the loop can execute one more time if `i` is increased by 1.
State: **`n` is at least 12, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is at least 4, counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal for the selected combination**
