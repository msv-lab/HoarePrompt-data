Example Answer:
`tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x`. The previous values of `x` are unknown, so the exact value of `tem` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 12, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is at least 4, counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal for the selected combination.
