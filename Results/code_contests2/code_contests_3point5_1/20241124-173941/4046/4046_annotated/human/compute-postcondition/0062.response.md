Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 12, `ans` is updated based on specific conditions, `i` is at least 4, and the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are not equal for the selected combination. If the count of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal and `tem` is formed by converting `x` to an integer, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
