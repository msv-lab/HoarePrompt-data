According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than 10. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If n is at least 12, ans is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of ans and tem if tem is greater than or equal to n. i is less than 10, counts of '7' and '4' in x are equal for the selected combination. If the count of '7' and '4' in x are equal, tem is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in x. If the loop does not execute, no changes occur in the variables n, ans, i, counts of '7' and '4' in x.**
