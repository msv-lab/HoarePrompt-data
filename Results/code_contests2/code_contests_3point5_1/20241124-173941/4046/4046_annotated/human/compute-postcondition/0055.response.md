Example Answer: 
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` and `tem`. The states of `n`, `i`, and the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 12, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is at least 4, counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal for the selected combination.
Output State: **`n` is at least 12, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is at least 4, counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal for the selected combination**
