According to the code, the loop will execute again if the conditions specified for updating `ans` are met. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 12, `ans` has been updated based on specific conditions, `i` is at least 4, and the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are not equal for the selected combination. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the count of '7' and '4' in `x` must be equal, and `tem` formed by converting `x` to an integer must be less than `n`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are: the count of '7' and '4' in `x` must be equal, and `tem` formed by converting `x` to an integer must be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is at least 12, `ans` is updated based on specific conditions, `i` is at least 4, and the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal, `tem` is formed by converting `x` to an integer and `tem` is less than `n`**
