Example Answer:
The string `x` is joined together and converted to an integer, stored in variable `tem`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, l belongs to the set [12, 14, 16, ...], i is increased by 1, tem is an integer value representing the concatenation of the characters in string x.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, l belongs to the set [12, 14, 16, ...], i is increased by 1, tem is an integer value representing the concatenation of the characters in string x**
