Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, l belongs to the set [12, 14, 16, ...]. If the counts of '7' and '4' in x are equal, tem is recalculated based on the new combination of elements in list x. If tem is greater than or equal to n, then ans is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of ans and tem. Additionally, i is increased by 1.***
