Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 12, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is at least 4, the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal for the selected combination. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the initial `ans` and `tem`. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables `n`, `ans`, `i`, and the counts of '7' and '4' in `x`.***
