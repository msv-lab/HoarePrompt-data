The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user. It then calculates the minimum integer greater than or equal to `n` that consists of an equal number of '7's and '4's in its digits. This is achieved by iterating through combinations of '7' and '4' of increasing lengths until a suitable integer is found. The function then prints the calculated integer `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and has the functionality of finding this specific integer based on the input `n`.
