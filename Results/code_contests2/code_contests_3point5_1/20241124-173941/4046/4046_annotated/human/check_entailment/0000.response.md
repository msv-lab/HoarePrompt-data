Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly takes a positive integer input `n`, calculates the length of its string representation and adjusts it if the length is odd. Then it iterates through all possible combinations of '7' and '4' of varying lengths to find the least super lucky number that is greater than or equal to `n`. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
