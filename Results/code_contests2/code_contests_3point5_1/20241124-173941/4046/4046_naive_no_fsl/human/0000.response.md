Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to the input number n. It considers all possible combinations of '4' and '7' digits, checks if the count of '4's and '7's is equal, and then selects the minimum super lucky number that is greater than or equal to n. The program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
