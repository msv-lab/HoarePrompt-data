Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, splits the text into words, and calculates the volume of the text as the maximum number of capital letters in any word. It iterates through each word, counts the number of capital letters in each word, and keeps track of the maximum volume encountered so far. The final output is the correct volume of the text. The program handles both the case where there is only one word in the text and the case where there are multiple words.
