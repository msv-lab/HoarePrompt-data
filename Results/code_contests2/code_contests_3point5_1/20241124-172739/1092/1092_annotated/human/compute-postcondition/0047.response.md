Example Answer: 
The value of `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and `m`. If `s` is greater than `m`, then `m` will be assigned the value of `s`. If `m` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `m` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a list of words, `s` is the total count of uppercase words in the list, `m` is the maximum value of `s` across all iterations, `i` is a valid iterable object pointing to the next element in the list. If the list is empty, the loop does not execute and `s`, `m` remain 0.
