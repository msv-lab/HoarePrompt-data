Example Answer:
`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is unknown, so the new value of `s` will be increased by 1. The values of `l`, `m`, and `i` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a list of words, `s` is an integer, `m` is the maximum value between the current `s` and `m`, `i` has more elements left to iterate through.
Output State: **`l` is a list of words, `s` is an integer, `m` is the maximum value between the current `s` and `m`, `i` has more elements left to iterate through**
