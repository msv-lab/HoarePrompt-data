Postcondition: ***`l` is a list of words, `s` is an integer representing the count of uppercase words incremented by 1, `m` is the maximum value between the previous `m` and the updated `s`, `i` still has elements left to iterate through. This holds true for all cases where the word `j` is uppercase.***
