According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `i` and the condition related to `j` being an uppercase word. At the end of the last iteration, `l` contains at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` still contains elements to iterate over, `j` is an uppercase word. If `j` is uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1 and becomes either 1 or 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`l` contains at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` still contains elements to iterate over, `j` is an uppercase word, `s` is either 1 or 2**
