According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 1 word, the loop will execute. Since `m` is 0 at the start, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, the list `l` must have at least 1 word, and `i` should be the first word in the list.
State: **List `l` contains at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list**
