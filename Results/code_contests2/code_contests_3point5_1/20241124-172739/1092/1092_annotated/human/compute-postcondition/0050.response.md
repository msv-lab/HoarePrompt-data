Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of 'm' which holds the maximum count of uppercase letters found in a word across all iterations. If 'l' is empty, the loop will not execute, and 's' and 'm' will remain 0. Therefore, the Output State is: If 'l' is a non-empty list of words, 's' will represent the count of uppercase letters in each word. 'm' will hold the maximum count of uppercase letters found in a word across all iterations. If 'l' is empty, the loop will not execute, and 's' and 'm' will remain 0.
