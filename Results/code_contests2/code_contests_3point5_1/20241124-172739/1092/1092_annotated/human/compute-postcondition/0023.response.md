Postcondition: ***`l` is a list of words, `s` is an integer where it is increased by 1 if the word `j` is in uppercase, `m` is updated to the maximum value between the current `s` and `m`, `i` is a valid iterable object. The function checks if the word `j` in the list is in uppercase and increments `s` by 1 accordingly.***
