According to the code, the loop can only execute if `i` is an iterable object (like a list). Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that `i` is a valid iterable object. Additionally, since `s` and `m` are involved in determining the loop execution, they need to be updated accordingly. 

State: **`l` is a list of words, `s` is 0, `m` is the maximum value between the current `s` and `m`, and `i` is a valid iterable object**
