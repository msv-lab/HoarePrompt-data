According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements left in `i` to iterate over. If there are still elements in `i`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` contains at least 1 word, `m` is 0. If the next element `j` is an uppercase word, `s` is either 0 or 1 based on the current value of `s` and it is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next element `j` must be an uppercase word, and `s` needs to be adjusted accordingly. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`l` contains at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` still contains elements to iterate over, `j` is an uppercase word, `s` is either 0 or 1 based on the current value of `s` and it is incremented by 1**
