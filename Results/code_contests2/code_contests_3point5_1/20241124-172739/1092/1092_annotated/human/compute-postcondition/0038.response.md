Postcondition: ***`l` is a list of words, `s` is either 0 or 1 based on whether the first element `j` is an uppercase word, `m` is the maximum value between the initial `m` and the updated `s`, `i` is a valid iterable object, `j` is the first element in `i`. If the first element `j` is uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
