Postcondition: ***`l` is a list of words, `s` is either 1 or 2 based on whether the next element in `i` is an uppercase word, `m` is the maximum value between the initial `m` and the updated `s`, `i` is a valid iterable object with at least one more element to iterate over, `j` is the next element in `i`. If `j` is uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1. The value of `m` is updated to be the maximum of the initial `m` and the updated `s`.***
