Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input text, splits it into words, and then iterates through each word to count the number of uppercase letters in each word. It keeps track of the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any word. Finally, it prints out this maximum count, which is the volume of the text as defined in the problem description.

The program follows the problem description for every potential case, as it accurately calculates the volume of the text based on the number of uppercase letters in each word. The logic is correct and there are no missing edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
