The function `func` reads a text input consisting of multiple words separated by spaces, where each word contains both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It then calculates and prints the maximum count of uppercase characters in a single word. If the input text is empty, the function does not execute the loop and prints 0. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
