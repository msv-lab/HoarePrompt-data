According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is not empty. The loop iterates over the elements of `i`. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is not empty and `j` is the first element in `i`. Additionally, `s` needs to be incremented by 1 if `j` is an uppercase character.
State: **`m` is the maximum value between the old `m` and `s`, `l` is not empty with the next element in `l` as `j`, `s` is incremented by 1 if the next element `j` is an uppercase character, `i` is not empty, `s` is 0, `j` is the first element in `i` and `s` is incremented by 1 if `j` is an uppercase character**.
