According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is iterable, the loop can execute. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
- `i` should be an iterable object.
- `m` must be the maximum value between `s` and `m`.
- `l` should not be empty, and the next element in `l` should be stored in `i`.
- `s` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `l` is not empty with the next element in `l` as `i`, `s` is initialized to 0, `i` is an iterable object**.
