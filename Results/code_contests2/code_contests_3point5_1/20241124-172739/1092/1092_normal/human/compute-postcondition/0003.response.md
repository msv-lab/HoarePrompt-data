According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l. If l is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, m is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to l is not empty and i is the first element in the list l. 
State: **m is 0, l is not empty, i is the first element in list l**
