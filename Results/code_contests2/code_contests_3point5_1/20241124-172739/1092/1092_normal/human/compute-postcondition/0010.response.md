Example Answer: 
`s` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `s` and other variables are not provided, so the output state is: `m` is 0, `l` is not empty with `i` as an iterable element, `s` is 1 if the next element in `i` after the previous iteration is an uppercase character. Otherwise, `s` remains 0, `s` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`m` is 0, `l` is not empty with `i` as an iterable element, `s` is 1 if the next element in `i` after the previous iteration is an uppercase character. Otherwise, `s` remains 0, `s` is incremented by 1**
