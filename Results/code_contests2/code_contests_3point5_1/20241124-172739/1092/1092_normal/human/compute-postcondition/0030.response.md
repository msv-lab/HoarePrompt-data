According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is the maximum value between the old `m` and `s`, `l` is not empty with the next element in `l` as `j`, `s` is incremented by 1 if the next element `j` is an uppercase character, `i` has more elements, `s` is incremented by 1 if `j` is an uppercase character. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. `l` needs to have the next element in `l` as `j`.
2. `s` needs to be incremented by 1 if the next element `j` is an uppercase character.
3. `i` needs to have more elements.

State: **`m` is the maximum value between the old `m` and `s`, `l` is not empty with the next element in `l` as `j`, `s` is incremented by 1 if the next element `j` is an uppercase character, `i` has more elements**
