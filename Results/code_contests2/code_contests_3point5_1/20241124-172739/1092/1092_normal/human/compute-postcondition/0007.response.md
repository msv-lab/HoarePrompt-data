Example Answer: 
The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0. After execution, the value of `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 0, `l` is not empty with `i` as an iterable element, `s` is 1, `j` is the first element in `i`, `j` is an uppercase character.
Output State: **`m` is 0, `l` is not empty with `i` as an iterable element, `s` is 1, `j` is the first element in `i`, `j` is an uppercase character**
