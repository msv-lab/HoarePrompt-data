Postcondition: ***`m` is 0, `l` is not empty with `i` as an iterable element. If the current element `j` in `i` is an uppercase character, `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains the same as the previous iteration. The program ensures that the value of `s` reflects the count of uppercase characters encountered in the iterations of `i`.***
