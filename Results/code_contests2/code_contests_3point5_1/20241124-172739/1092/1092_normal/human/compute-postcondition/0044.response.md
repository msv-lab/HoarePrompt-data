Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `m` is the maximum value between the old `m` and `s`. `l` is not empty with the next element in `l` as `j`. If `j` is an uppercase character, `s` is incremented by 1. `i` is not empty with `j` being the next element in `i`. If `j` is an uppercase character, `s` is incremented by 1. `s` is 0, `j` is the next element in `i`. If `j` is an uppercase character, `s` is incremented by 1. If `j` is an uppercase character, `s` is incremented by 1. Overall, the value of `s` is updated based on the conditions related to the uppercase character in the given variables.***
