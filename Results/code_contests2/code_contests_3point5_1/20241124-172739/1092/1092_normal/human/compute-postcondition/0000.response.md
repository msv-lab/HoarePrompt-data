The `raw_input()` function reads input from the user but does not store it in any variable. Since the input is not stored in any variable, the state of the program remains unchanged.
Output State: **Precondition: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200. The text consists of n words separated by single spaces, each word consisting of small and capital Latin letters.**
