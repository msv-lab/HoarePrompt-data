According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in `i` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, the states are: `m` is the maximum value between the old `m` and `s`, `l` is not empty with the next element in `l` as `j`, `s` is incremented by 1 if `j` is an uppercase character, `i` has more elements. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since `i` needs to have more elements, there should be more elements left in `i` for iteration.
2. The next element in `l` should be assigned to `j`.
3. If the next element `j` is an uppercase character, `s` needs to be incremented by 1.
4. No changes are needed for `m`.

State: **`m` is the maximum value between the old `m` and `s`, `l` is not empty with the next element in `l` as `j`, `s` is incremented by 1 if the next element `j` is an uppercase character, `i` has more elements**.
