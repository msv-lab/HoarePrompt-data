According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is not empty, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is the maximum value between the old `m` and `s`, `l` is not empty with the next element in `l` as `j`, `s` is incremented by 1 if the next element `j` is an uppercase character, `i` has more elements, `s` is incremented by 1 if `j` is an uppercase character. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` cannot be empty.
State: **`m` is the maximum value between the old `m` and `s`, `l` is not empty with the next element in `l` as `j`, `s` is incremented by 1 if the next element `j` is an uppercase character, `i` has more elements, `s` is incremented by 1 if `j` is an uppercase character.**
