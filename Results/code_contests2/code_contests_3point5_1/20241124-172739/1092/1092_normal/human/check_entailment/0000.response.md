Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads a text input consisting of multiple words separated by spaces. It then calculates and prints the maximum count of uppercase characters in a single word, which aligns with the problem description. The code iterates through each word, counts the number of uppercase letters in each word, and keeps track of the maximum count found so far. Finally, it prints the maximum count as the output. The code handles the case where the input text is empty by printing 0, which is consistent with the problem description. Additionally, the output hints also confirm that the code calculates the volume of the given text correctly. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct.
