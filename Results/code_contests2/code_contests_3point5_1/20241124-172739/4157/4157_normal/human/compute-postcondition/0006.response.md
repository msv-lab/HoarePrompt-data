Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `t`, which is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`. The previous values of `t`, `t1`, and `ti` are not known, so the output state is `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`**
