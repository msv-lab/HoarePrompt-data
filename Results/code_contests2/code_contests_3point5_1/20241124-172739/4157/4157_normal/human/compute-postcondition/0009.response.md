Example Answer:
The value of `t1` is calculated based on the values of `v`, `a`, and `d`. The value of `t1` is then assigned to be the maximum of `t1 + ti` and `t`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned float values obtained from the input split. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` are assigned the float values obtained from the input split.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` are assigned the float values obtained from the input split**
