According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, and `i` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the value of `t` needs to be updated based on the condition `t = max(t1 + ti, t)`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1**
