Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`. The value of `t1` is not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `t`. However, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values obtained from the input split. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values obtained from the input split.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values obtained from the input split**
