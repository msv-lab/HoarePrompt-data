According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` have float values obtained from the input split, `i` is less than `n+1`**
