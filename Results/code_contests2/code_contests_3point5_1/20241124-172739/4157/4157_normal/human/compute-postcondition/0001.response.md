Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned by mapping the input as integers after splitting it. The values of `n`, `a`, and `d` depend on the input provided. The initial state is `t` is 0.0, and after execution, the values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are determined by the input.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are based on the input provided**
