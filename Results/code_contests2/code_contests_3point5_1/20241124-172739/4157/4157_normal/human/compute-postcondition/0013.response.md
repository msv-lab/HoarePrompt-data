Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned float values obtained from the input split. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `t` is updated to be the maximum between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`. The condition `i` is less than `n+1` is not directly impacted by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` have float values obtained from the input split.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` have float values obtained from the input split**
