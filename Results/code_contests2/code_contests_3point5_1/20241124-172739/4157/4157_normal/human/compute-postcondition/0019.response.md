The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the final position after n time intervals based on the initial position a, the constant velocity d, and a list of time intervals ti and velocities vi. The function takes into consideration the constraints provided for n, a, d, ti, and vi. 
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the final position after n time intervals based on the initial position, constant velocity, and list of time intervals and velocities provided.**
