Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It reads input for the number of time intervals `n`, initial position `a`, and constant velocity `d`. It then calculates the final position after `n` time intervals based on the provided time intervals and velocities. The function iterates over `n` time intervals, calculates the time taken to reach the final position, and updates the maximum time `t` accordingly. At the end of each iteration, it prints the current maximum time `t`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `t` remains as 0.0. Note that the code uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3.**
