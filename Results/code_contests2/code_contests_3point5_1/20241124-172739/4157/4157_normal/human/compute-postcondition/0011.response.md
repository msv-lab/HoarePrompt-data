Example Answer:
The maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t` is printed. The variables `t`, `t1`, `ti`, and `i` are all affected. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `ti` and `v` are assigned float values obtained from the input split. The final value of `t` depends on the comparison between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`. The output state is: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` have float values obtained from the input split.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` have float values obtained from the input split**
