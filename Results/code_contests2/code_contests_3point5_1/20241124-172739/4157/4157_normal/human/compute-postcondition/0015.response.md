Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, where `ti` and `v` are float values obtained from the input split. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. After execution, the new value of `t` will be the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1**
