Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum time by which each trolleybus can reach the final station based on the given constraints of acceleration, maximum speed, and distance. It iterates through each trolleybus, calculates the time using the provided formula, and updates the maximum time accordingly. The program then prints the calculated time for each trolleybus. The logic seems to be correct and follows the problem description accurately. Additionally, the program handles the case where a trolleybus catches up with another one and they travel together until the final station. Overall, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
