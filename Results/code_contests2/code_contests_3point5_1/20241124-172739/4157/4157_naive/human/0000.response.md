Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the arrival time for each trolleybus based on the provided formula. It considers the acceleration, maximum speed, and distance to the final station for each trolleybus. The program iterates through each trolleybus, calculates the arrival time, and keeps track of the maximum arrival time among all trolleybuses. The output is then printed for each trolleybus in the order given in the input. The program covers all potential cases and correctly calculates the arrival times for each trolleybus according to the problem description.
