According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. No other information is provided about the initial state. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, `i` is updated to i + 1**
