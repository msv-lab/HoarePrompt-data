Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`. The value of `t1` is calculated based on the existing values of `a`, `d`, and `v`. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`.
Output State: **`t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`**
