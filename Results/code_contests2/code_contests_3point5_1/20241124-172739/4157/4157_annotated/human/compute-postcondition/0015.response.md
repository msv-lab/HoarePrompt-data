Example Answer: 
`t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`. The previous values are `total` unchanged, `i` is one more than the previous value, `n` is unchanged, `ti` is assigned the first float value from the input, and `v` is assigned the second float value from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is unchanged, `i` is one more than the previous value, `n` is unchanged, `ti` is assigned the first float value from the input, `v` is assigned the second float value from the input, and `t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`.
Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is one more than the previous value, `n` is unchanged, `ti` is assigned the first float value from the input, `v` is assigned the second float value from the input, and `t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`**
