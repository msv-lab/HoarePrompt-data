Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned values based on the input provided after splitting it. Since `ti` is assigned a float value and `v` is assigned a float value, the output state is: `t` is 0.0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are input integers, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are input integers, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float**
