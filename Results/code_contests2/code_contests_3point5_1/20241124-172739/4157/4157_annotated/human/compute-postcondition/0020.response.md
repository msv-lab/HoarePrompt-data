Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It calculates the arrival time for each trolleybus based on its departure time and maximum speed, updating the maximum arrival time encountered during the process. It prints the final maximum arrival time. If the input `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and the final `t` value remains 0.0.**
