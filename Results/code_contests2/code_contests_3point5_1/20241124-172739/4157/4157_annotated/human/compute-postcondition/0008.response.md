Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned float values parsed from the input using `map(float, raw_input().split())`. The values of `ti` and `v` are now determined by the input. `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, and `i` is updated to i + 1. The output state is: `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, `i` is updated to i + 1, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from the input.
Output State: **`t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, `i` is updated to i + 1, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from the input**
