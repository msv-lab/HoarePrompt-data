Example Answer:
The variables `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input string. The `map` function converts the input values to integers. As the initial state only includes `t`, the output state after running the code is: `t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are input integers.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are input integers**
