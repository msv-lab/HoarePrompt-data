According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is one more than the previous value. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Increment the value of `i` by 1
- Update the value of `t` to be the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`

State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is one more than the previous value, `n` is unchanged, `ti` is assigned the first float value from the input, `v` is assigned the second float value from the input, `t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`**
