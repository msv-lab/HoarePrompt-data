Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. The value of `i` is updated to i + 1. The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from the input. The value of `t1` is calculated based on the given formula. After execution, the updated values of `t`, `i`, `ti`, `v`, and `t1` depend on the specific input values. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `i`, `ti`, `v`, and `t1` are updated based on the specific input values.
Output State: **`t`, `i`, `ti`, `v`, and `t1` are updated based on the specific input values**
