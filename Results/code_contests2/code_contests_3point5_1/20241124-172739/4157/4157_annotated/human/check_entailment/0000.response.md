Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input correctly by first taking in the integers n, a, and d, and then iterating over each trolleybus to read their departure time and maximum speed.
2. The program correctly calculates the time it takes for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on the given acceleration and distance using the provided formula.
3. The program then prints the calculated time for each trolleybus in the order they were given in the input.
4. The logic within the for loop ensures that the trolleybuses do not overtake each other and arrive at the final station as quickly as possible.
5. The program handles all potential cases based on the problem description and produces the expected output for the given examples.
