Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly count the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set. It only considers the characters at positions that are multiples of 3 and discards the characters in between. This will result in incorrect counts for various inputs. 

For example:
Input
{a, b, c, a, c}

Output
2

In this case, the program will only consider the characters at positions 1 and 4, resulting in an incorrect count of 2 instead of 3. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
