Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly count the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. It has some logical errors in the implementation. For example, in the input "{b, a, b, a}", the program should output 2, but the program will output 1 because it only considers every third character in the input string. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
