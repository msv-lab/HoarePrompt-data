Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. It is supposed to count the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set, but the current implementation is splitting the input string incorrectly and not counting the distinct letters accurately. 

For example, given the input "{a, b, c}", the program would output 1 instead of 3. This is because the current implementation is splitting the input string incorrectly and not considering the distinct letters in the set.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
