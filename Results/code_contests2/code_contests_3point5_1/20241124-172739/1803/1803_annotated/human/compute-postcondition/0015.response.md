Functionality: ** The function reads an input string `Cadena`, extracts elements from `Cadena` at positions k, k+3, k+6, ..., k+n (where n is the number of iterations) and stores them in a list `Arreglo`. The loop continues as long as the length of `Cadena` is greater than the current index `k` and greater than 2. After the loop, it prints the count of unique elements in `Arreglo`. The function does not accept any parameters. **
