Example Answer:
The element at index `k` in `Cadena` is added to `Arreglo`, and `k` is incremented by 6. Since the initial state is not provided, we can only determine that the length of `Arreglo` increases by 1, and `k` is incremented by 6.
Output State: **`Arreglo` has a new element added, `k` is incremented by 6**
