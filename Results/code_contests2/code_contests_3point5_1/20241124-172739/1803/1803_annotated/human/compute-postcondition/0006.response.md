Example Answer:
The element at index `k` in the string `Cadena` is added to the list `Arreglo`, and `k` is incremented by 6. The length of `Cadena` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string of length not exceeding 1000, starting with an opening curved bracket, ending with a closing curved bracket, and containing small English letters separated by a comma and space; `Arreglo` is updated by adding an element from `Cadena`, and `k` is incremented by 6.
