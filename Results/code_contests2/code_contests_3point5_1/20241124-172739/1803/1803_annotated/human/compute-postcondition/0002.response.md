Example Answer:
The variable `k` is assigned the value 1. Since there are no operations involving other variables and the initial state mentions that `Arreglo` is an empty list, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **Cadena is a string of length not exceeding 1000, starting with an opening curved bracket, ending with a closing curved bracket, and containing small English letters separated by a comma and space; Arreglo is an empty list**
