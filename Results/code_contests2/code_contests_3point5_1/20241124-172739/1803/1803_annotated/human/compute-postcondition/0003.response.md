Example Answer:
`Arreglo` is updated by adding the element `Cadena[k]`, where `k` is the index being accessed in the string `Cadena`. The length of `Cadena` is not provided, but assuming `k` is a valid index, the element at index `k` in `Cadena` is added to `Arreglo`. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string of length not exceeding 1000, starting with an opening curved bracket, ending with a closing curved bracket, and containing small English letters separated by a comma and space; `Arreglo` is updated by adding an element from `Cadena`.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string of length not exceeding 1000, starting with an opening curved bracket, ending with a closing curved bracket, and containing small English letters separated by a comma and space; `Arreglo` is updated by adding an element from `Cadena`**
