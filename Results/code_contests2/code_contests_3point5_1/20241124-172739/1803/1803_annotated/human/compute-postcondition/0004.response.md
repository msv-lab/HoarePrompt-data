Example Answer:
`k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is unknown, so the new value of `k` will be the previous unknown value + 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string of length not exceeding 1000, starting with an opening curved bracket, ending with a closing curved bracket, and containing small English letters separated by a comma and space; `Arreglo` is updated by adding an element from `Cadena`, `k` is incremented by 3.
