Output State: **If the length of Cadena is greater than k and greater than 2, then Arreglo will contain elements from Cadena at positions k, k+3, k+6, ..., k+n where n is the number of times the loop was executed. The loop will stop when the length of Cadena is less than or equal to k or less than or equal to 2. After the loop finishes, Arreglo will have elements added from Cadena and k will be incremented by 3 times the number of times the loop was executed.**
