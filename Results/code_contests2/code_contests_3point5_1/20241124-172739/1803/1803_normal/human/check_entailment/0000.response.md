Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code does not correctly extract the distinct letters from Anton's set. The code only extracts letters from the input string with a fixed interval of 3 positions, which does not cover all cases where letters might be repeated in the set. For example, in the input "{b, a, b, a}", the code would only extract the letters 'a' and 'a' as the interval of 3 positions skips the second 'b'. This leads to an incorrect count of distinct letters in Anton's set. The output hints also confirm that the code does not handle all potential cases as it only provides a limited explanation of the code's functionality.
