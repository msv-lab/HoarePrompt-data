Example Answer:
k is increased by 4, so if k was initially 0, after executing the code, k will be 4. The values of Cadena and Arreglo are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: Cadena is a string representing a set of letters with opening and closing curved brackets, where each letter is separated by a comma followed by a space; Arreglo contains 'a', 'a', 'a'; k is increased by 4.
Output State: **Cadena is a string representing a set of letters with opening and closing curved brackets, where each letter is separated by a comma followed by a space; Arreglo contains 'a', 'a', 'a'; k is increased by 4**
