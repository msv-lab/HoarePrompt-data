Output State: **if len(Cadena) is greater than k and greater than 2, then Arreglo contains the elements from Cadena at positions k, k+3, k+6, ..., k+n (where n is the number of times the loop executed); k is increased by 3 after each iteration. If len(Cadena) is not greater than k or not greater than 2, the loop does not execute**
