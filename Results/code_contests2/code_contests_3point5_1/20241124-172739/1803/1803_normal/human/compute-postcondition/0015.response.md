Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string input from the user, then it extracts specific characters from the input string based on certain conditions. The extracted characters are stored in a list `Arreglo` where each character is separated by a fixed interval of 3 positions. After extracting the characters, the function prints out the count of unique characters in the list `Arreglo`. The function does not explicitly return any value. It operates under the assumption that the input string follows the specified pattern and that the conditions for character extraction are met.**
