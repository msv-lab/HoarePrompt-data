Example Answer:
Arreglo is appended with the value at index k in Cadena, which is 'a' since k is increased by 4. The previous value of Arreglo is ['a', 'a'], and the value at index k in Cadena is 'a'. Therefore, after execution, Arreglo becomes ['a', 'a', 'a'] and k is increased by 4.
Output State: **Cadena is a string representing a set of letters with opening and closing curved brackets, where each letter is separated by a comma followed by a space; Arreglo contains 'a', 'a', 'a'; k is increased by 4**
