Example Answer: 
The value at index k (which is 4) of Cadena is added to the Arreglo list. Since k is 4, the value at index 4 of Cadena will be added to Arreglo. Therefore, the Output State is: Cadena is a string representing a set of letters with opening and closing curved brackets, where each letter is separated by a comma followed by a space; Arreglo contains 'a', 'a'.
Output State: **Cadena is a string representing a set of letters with opening and closing curved brackets, where each letter is separated by a comma followed by a space; Arreglo contains 'a', 'a'**
