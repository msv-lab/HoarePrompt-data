Example Answer:
The value at index 1 of Cadena is added to Arreglo. Since k is 1, the value at index 1 is 'a'. Therefore, 'a' is added to Arreglo. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **Cadena is a string representing a set of letters with opening and closing curved brackets, where each letter is separated by a comma followed by a space; Arreglo contains 'a', k is 1**
