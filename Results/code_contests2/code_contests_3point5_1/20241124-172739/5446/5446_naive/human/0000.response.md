Correctness: **False**

In the given program, there are some issues:
1. The input variables are assigned incorrectly as `(n, b, c)` instead of `(n, a, b)`.
2. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python, it should be `input()` instead.
3. The program is using `ceil` function without importing it from the math module.
4. The calculation logic seems incorrect and does not follow the problem description accurately.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
