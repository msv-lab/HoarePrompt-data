Correctness: False

Example where the program does not work as expected:
Input:
4 7 10

Expected Output:
3

Actual Output:
2

Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates the maximum possible number x. In this case, the correct answer should be 3, but the program outputs 2. This means the program does not always follow the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
