Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned based on the input provided by the user. Since the initial state of variables `a` and `b` is unknown, the output state will be: `a`, `b`, and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b**
