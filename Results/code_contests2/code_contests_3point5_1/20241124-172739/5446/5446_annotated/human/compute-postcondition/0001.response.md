Example Answer:
The variable `x` is assigned the value of the maximum value between `b` and `c` divided by the minimum value between `b` and `c`. Since `c` is not defined in the initial state, this code snippet will result in an error. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b**
