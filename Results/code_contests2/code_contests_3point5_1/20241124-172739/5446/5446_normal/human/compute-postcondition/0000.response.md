Example Answer: 
`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input based on whitespaces. The values of `n`, `b`, and `c` depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input**
