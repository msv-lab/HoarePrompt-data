Example Answer: 
`x` is assigned the result of dividing the maximum value between `b` and `c` by the minimum value between `b` and `c`. The values of `b` and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input. After calculation, `x` will have a float value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input, `x` is a float value.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input, `x` is a float value**
