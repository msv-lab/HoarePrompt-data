Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly follow the problem description. The program should calculate the maximum possible number of pieces on each plate, but the code does not implement this logic. Instead, it calculates a different value based on a ratio between the larger and smaller numbers, which is not required by the problem description. Additionally, the output hints do not align with the expected output based on the problem description. The code needs to be modified to accurately determine the maximum possible number x as per the given conditions.
