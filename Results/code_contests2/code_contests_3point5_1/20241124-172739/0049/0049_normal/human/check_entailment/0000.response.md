Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code only checks for a single decreasing sequence in the string and prints 'YES' if found. However, the problem description requires that the code should identify if it is possible to reverse some substring of the given string to obtain a string that is less lexicographically. This means that there might be multiple decreasing sequences in the string, and the code should handle all possible cases.

For example, if the input string is "abcdcba", the code will output 'YES' and the indices 3 and 4. However, the correct output should be 'YES' and the indices 2 and 5.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description.
