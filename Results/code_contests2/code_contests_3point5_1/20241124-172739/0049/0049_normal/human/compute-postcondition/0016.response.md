Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a user input value, `flag` is True, `i` is less than `n - 1, `pos` is assigned the value of `i` if `c[i] > c[i + 1]`. If `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, then `flag` is set to True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `n`, `c`, `flag`, `i`, and `pos`.***
