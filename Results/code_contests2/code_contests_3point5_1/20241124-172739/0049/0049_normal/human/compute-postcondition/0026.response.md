Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `c` from the user input. It then iterates over the characters of `c` and checks if there is a decreasing sequence of characters. If such a sequence is found, it prints 'YES' along with the indices where the sequence occurred. If no decreasing sequence is found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. It may miss cases where the decreasing sequence occurs multiple times or at different positions in the string `c`.**
