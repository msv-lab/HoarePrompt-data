Postcondition: ***n is an integer. If n is greater than or equal to 2 and the condition c[i] > c[i + 1] is met at least once, flag is True and pos is the index where the condition was last met. If the condition is never met, flag is False. If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute. After the if else block executes, if flag is True, 'YES' is printed along with the indices pos + 1 and pos + 2. If flag is False, 'NO' is printed. If n is less than 2, 'NO' is printed.***
