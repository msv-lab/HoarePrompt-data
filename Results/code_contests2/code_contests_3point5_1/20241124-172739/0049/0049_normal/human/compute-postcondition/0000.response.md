Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` reads input from the user and splits it into a list of strings, and `map(int, ...)` converts those strings to integers. Since `n` is an integer, the value assigned to `n` will be a list of integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is a list of integers**
