Example Answer:
The value of `n` is reassigned to be the first element of the list `n`. If the initial list `n` contains integers, then `n` will now hold the value of the first integer in the list. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer value extracted from the list.
Output State: **`n` is an integer value extracted from the list**
