Example Answer:
The code prints pos + 1 and pos + 2, where pos is the index where the condition c[i] > c[i + 1] was last met. If the condition is never met, flag remains False, so pos will not be updated. Therefore, if the condition is never met, pos remains the same as the initial value and the output state is: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, flag is False, and pos is the same as the initial index value.
Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, flag is False, and pos is the same as the initial index value**
