Example Answer:
The variable `flag` is initialized with the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n` and `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer value extracted from the list, `c` is a user input value, `flag` is False.
Output State: **`n` is an integer value extracted from the list, `c` is a user input value, `flag` is False**
