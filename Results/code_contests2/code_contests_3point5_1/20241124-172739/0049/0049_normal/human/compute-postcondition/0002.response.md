Example Answer:
The variable `c` is assigned a value obtained from user input using `raw_input()`. The value of `n` is not affected as it was obtained prior to this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer value extracted from the list, `c` is a user input value.
Output State: **`n` is an integer value extracted from the list, `c` is a user input value**
