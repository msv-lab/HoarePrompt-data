Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly determines if it is possible to reverse a substring of the given string to obtain a lexicographically less string. It iterates through the string and checks if there exists a character that is greater than the next character, indicating that a reversal can be done. The program then prints the indices of the substring to be reversed. The logic provided covers all potential cases, and there is no scenario where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
