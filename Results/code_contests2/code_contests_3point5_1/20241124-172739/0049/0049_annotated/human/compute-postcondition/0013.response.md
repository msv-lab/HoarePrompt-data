According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. If `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1], `flag` is set to True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, `i` is less than `n - 1. After the execution of the if statement, if `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1], `flag` is set to True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`.

To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and all other states remain the same.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1], `flag` is set to True, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, `i` is less than `n - 1**
