Example Answer:
The variable `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is at least 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, flag is True, and `pos` is now equal to `i`.
Output State: **n is at least 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, flag is True, `pos` is now equal to `i`**
