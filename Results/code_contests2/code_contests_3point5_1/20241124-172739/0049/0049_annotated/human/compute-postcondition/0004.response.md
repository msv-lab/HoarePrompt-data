According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 2 because it iterates from 0 to n-2. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, and `flag` remains False.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `flag` is False**
