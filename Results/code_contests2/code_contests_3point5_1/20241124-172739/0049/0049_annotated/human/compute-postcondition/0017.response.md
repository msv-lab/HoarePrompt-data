According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows: n is at least 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, c[i] is greater than c[i + 1], flag is set to True, pos is assigned the value of i, i is less than n - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- n remains at least 2
- s remains a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters
- c[i] is greater than c[i + 1]
- flag is set to True
- pos is assigned the value of i
- i is less than n - 2 (to satisfy the loop condition i < n - 1)

State: **n is at least 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, c[i] is greater than c[i + 1], flag is set to True, pos is assigned the value of i, i is less than n - 2**
