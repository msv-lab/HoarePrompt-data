Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts input and splits it, then `map(int, ...)` converts each input to an integer. The variable `n` now holds a list of integers. The state of variable `s` is not affected.
Output State: **`n` is a list of integers, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters**
