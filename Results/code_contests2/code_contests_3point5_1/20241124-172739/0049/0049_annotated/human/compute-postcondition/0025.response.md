The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the constraints provided for `n` and `s`, which are an integer and a string, respectively. The integer `n` must be within the range 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and the string `s` must consist only of lowercase Latin letters.

The function `func` does not have a predefined output provided in the constraints.
