Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. If `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1], `flag` is set to True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, `i` is less than `n - 1. After the execution of the if statement, if `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1], `flag` is set to True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
