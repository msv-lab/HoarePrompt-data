Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. If c[i] is greater than c[i + 1], `flag` is set to True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. This condition covers all cases where the comparison between c[i] and c[i + 1] results in True, leading to the update of `flag` and `pos`.***
