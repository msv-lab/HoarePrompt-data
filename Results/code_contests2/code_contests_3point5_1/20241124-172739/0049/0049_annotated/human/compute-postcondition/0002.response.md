`c` is assigned the value of the raw input, which can be any string. The variables `n` and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of the list of integers, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.
Output State: **`n` is the first element of the list of integers, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters**
