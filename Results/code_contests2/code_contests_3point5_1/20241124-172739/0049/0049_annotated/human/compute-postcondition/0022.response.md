Postcondition: ***If `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, and there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in the list `c` such that `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, then `flag` is True and `pos` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of such a pair. If there are no such pairs or `n` is less than 2, `flag` remains False.***
