According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. If `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, `flag` is set to True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. To execute one more time, the loop needs to adjust `i` to be less than `n - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, if `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1], `flag` is set to True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, `i` is less than `n - 1`**
