Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `c` from the standard input. It then iterates through the string `c` to find if there exists a pair of adjacent elements where the current element is greater than the next element. If such a pair is found, it sets `flag` to True and stores the index of the first occurrence of this pair in `pos`. Finally, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the pair if found, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return a value.**

Potential Edge Cases/Missing Functionality:
- The code does not handle the case where `n` is less than 2 explicitly. It could be beneficial to add logic to handle this scenario.
- The function does not return any value, which may be unexpected based on the annotations.
