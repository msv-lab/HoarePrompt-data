Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if there exists at least one pair of adjacent characters in the string where the first character is greater than the second character. If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" along with the indices of the substring that needs to be reversed. If no such pair is found, it prints "NO". The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
