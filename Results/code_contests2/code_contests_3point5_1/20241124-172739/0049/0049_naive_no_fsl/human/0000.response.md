Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly determines if it is possible to reverse some substring of the given string to obtain a lexicographically less string. It iterates through the string and checks if there is a character that is greater than the next character, indicating that a reversal can be done to make the string lexicographically less. It then prints the indices of the substring to be reversed. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
