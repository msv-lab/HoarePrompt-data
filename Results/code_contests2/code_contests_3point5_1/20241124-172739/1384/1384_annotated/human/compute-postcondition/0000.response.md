Example Answer:
`t` and `x` are assigned the values of float conversions of the inputs after splitting them. Since the inputs are integers, the values of `t` and `x` will be decimal points. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a float, `x` is a float.
Output State: **`t` is a float, `x` is a float**
