Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integer inputs `t` and `x` and then calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for `t` hours in World B by dividing `t` by `x`. Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the inputs as integers, the program is correct for all potential cases.
