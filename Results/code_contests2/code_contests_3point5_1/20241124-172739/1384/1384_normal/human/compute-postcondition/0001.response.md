Example Answer:
t and x are assigned the values returned by mapping float conversion to the input split by space. The code then prints the result of t divided by x. The specific values of t and x are unknown, so the output state is: t and x are assigned float values from user input split by space, and the result of t divided by x is printed.
Output State: **t and x are assigned float values from user input split by space, the result of t divided by x is printed**
