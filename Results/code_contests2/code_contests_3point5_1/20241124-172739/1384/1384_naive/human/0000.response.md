Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers as input, T and X, and calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B by dividing T by X. The program correctly follows the problem description and provides the expected output for all potential cases. The program handles integer inputs within the given constraints and outputs the result with the required precision. Since there are no cases identified where the program does not work as described, the correctness is True.
