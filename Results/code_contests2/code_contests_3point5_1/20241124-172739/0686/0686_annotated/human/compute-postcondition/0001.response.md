The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns a string message based on the following conditions:
- If the product of `a` and `b` is less than `n`, the function returns "Product is less than n".
- If the product of `a` and `b` is greater than `m`, the function returns "Product is greater than m".
- If the product of `a` and `b` is between `n` and `m` (inclusive), the function returns "Product is between n and m".
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the product of `a` and `b`, and return a message based on whether the product falls below, within, or above the range specified by `n` and `m`.
