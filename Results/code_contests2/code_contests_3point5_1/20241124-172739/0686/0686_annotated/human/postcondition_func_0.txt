The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is expected to calculate the product of two variables `a` and `b`, but the code is missing the actual implementation of this calculation. The annotations describe that the function should return different messages based on the comparison of the product with given values `n` and `m`. However, since there is no logic provided to calculate the product, the function currently does not perform as described.
