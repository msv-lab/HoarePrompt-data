Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has syntax errors and logical issues that prevent it from working correctly. Here are the corrections needed:

1. Use `input()` instead of `raw_input()`.
2. Replace `(` and `)` with `print` to actually output the values.
3. Use integer division `//` instead of regular division `/` to avoid floating-point results.

Corrected Program:
```python
n = int(input())
if n <= 2:
    print(-1)
elif n % 2:
    print(n * n // 2, (n * n + 1) // 2)
else:
    print(n * n // 4 - 1, n * n // 4 + 1)
```

After correcting the syntax and logic issues, the program should now work correctly for all potential cases.
