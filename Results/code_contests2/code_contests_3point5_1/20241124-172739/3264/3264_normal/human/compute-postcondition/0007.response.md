Example Answer:
The code calculates two expressions: `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer larger than 2, the output of the first expression will be a floating-point number resulting from the division and subtraction, and the output of the second expression will be a floating-point number resulting from the division and addition. The variables are not affected directly. Therefore, the Output State is: *n is a positive integer larger than 2.
Output State: **n is a positive integer larger than 2**
