Example Answer:
The code calculates two expressions: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. Since n is an odd number, both expressions will result in whole numbers. Therefore, the first expression simplifies to (n^2 - 1) / 2, and the second expression simplifies to (n^2 + 1) / 2. The output state is n is a positive integer larger than 2, n is an odd number.
Output State: **n is a positive integer larger than 2, n is an odd number**
