Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code fails to provide the correct output for some cases. For example, if the input side length `n` is even, the code calculates the Pythagorean triple incorrectly. The code should output ((n * n / 4) - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1) for even `n`, but it misses the necessary brackets for these calculations, resulting in incorrect output. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
