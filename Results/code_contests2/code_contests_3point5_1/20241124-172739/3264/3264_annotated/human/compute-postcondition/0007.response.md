Example Answer:
The code calculates two values using the formula provided: `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer larger than 2, the result of these calculations will depend on the specific value of `n`. The output state will include the results of the two calculations.
Output State: **Two calculated values based on the formula: n * n / 4 - 1, n * n / 4 + 1**
