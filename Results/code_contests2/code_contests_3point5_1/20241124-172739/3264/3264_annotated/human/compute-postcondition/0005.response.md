Example Answer:
The code calculates two values based on n: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. Since n is an odd number larger than 2, both expressions will result in whole numbers. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer larger than 2 and n is an odd number.
Output State: **n is a positive integer larger than 2 and n is an odd number**
