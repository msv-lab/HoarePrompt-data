Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n is less than or equal to 2, the program prints -1. For odd values of n, the program prints ((n * n) - 1) / 2 and ((n * n) + 1) / 2. For even values of n, the program prints ((n * n) / 4 - 1) and (n * n) / 4 + 1. The program handles all possible cases of n being a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, ensuring correct computation and output.***
