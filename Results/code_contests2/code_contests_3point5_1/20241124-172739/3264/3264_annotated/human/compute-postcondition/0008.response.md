Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer larger than 2. If n is an odd number, the program prints (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. If n is an even number, the program prints (n * n / 4 - 1) and n * n / 4 + 1. The program handles all cases where n is a positive integer larger than 2, ensuring correct computation and output.***
