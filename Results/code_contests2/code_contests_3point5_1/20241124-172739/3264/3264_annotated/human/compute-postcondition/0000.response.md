Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, the range of possible values for `n` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
