Correctness: False

The provided Python program does not correctly implement the problem description for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 1, the program should output -1 according to the problem description. However, the program will output 0 instead. This discrepancy makes the program incorrect as it does not adhere to the requirements specified in the problem description.
