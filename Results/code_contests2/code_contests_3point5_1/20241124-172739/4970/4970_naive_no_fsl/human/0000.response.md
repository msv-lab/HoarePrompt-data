Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes an integer input and returns the corresponding value from the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Since the input range is specified as 0 ≤ a ≤ 15 and the output is a single integer from this list, the program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
