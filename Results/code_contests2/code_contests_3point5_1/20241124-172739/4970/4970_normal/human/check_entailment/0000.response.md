Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes an integer input and uses it as an index to access the corresponding element from the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The code directly follows the problem description by printing the element at the given index. The output is as expected and the code handles all possible input values from 0 to 15. The code does not require any error handling as the input range is specified to be between 0 and 15.
