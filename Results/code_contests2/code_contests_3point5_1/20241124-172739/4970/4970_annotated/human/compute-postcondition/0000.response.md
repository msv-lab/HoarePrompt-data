Example Answer:
The code retrieves the value at the index specified by the input from the list `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. Since the input is within the range of 0 to 15, the output will be the value at that index in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 15.
Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 15**
