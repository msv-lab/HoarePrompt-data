Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program takes an integer input and directly uses it as an index to access the corresponding element from a hardcoded list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. As the input is guaranteed to be in the range 0 to 15, the program will always output the correct integer from the list based on the input. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
