Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes an integer input and directly indexes into a list to retrieve the corresponding element. Since the list has 16 elements, ranging from 0 to 15, and the input integer is guaranteed to be between 0 and 15 (inclusive), the program will always output the correct value based on the input. Therefore, the program satisfies the problem description for all potential cases.
