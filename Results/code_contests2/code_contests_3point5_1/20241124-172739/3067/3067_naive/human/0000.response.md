Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly reads the input, processes the string S, and then answers the Q queries by calculating the number of times 'AC' occurs as a substring between the given indices l and r. The program maintains a prefix sum array P to keep track of the number of occurrences of 'AC' up to index i in the original string. It then calculates the answer for each query by taking the difference P[r - 1] - P[l - 1], which effectively gives the count of 'AC' substrings between the specified indices. The logic seems to cover all cases and works as expected for the given problem description.
