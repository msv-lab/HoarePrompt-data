Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program reads the input values N, Q, S, and the queries l_i, r_i correctly. It then calculates the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in consecutive pairs in string S using the list P. Finally, it prints the answer to each query correctly by subtracting the values at the corresponding indices in P. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, making the program correct.
