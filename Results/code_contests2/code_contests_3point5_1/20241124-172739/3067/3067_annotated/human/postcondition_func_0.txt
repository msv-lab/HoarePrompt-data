The function `func` reads input values N and Q, then processes string S to count the occurrences of the substring 'AC' in consecutive pairs. It initializes a list P with the counts. For each query in range Q, it reads input values l and r, and prints the difference between P[r-1] and P[l-1]. If N is 0, the loop does not execute, and all elements of P remain 0.
