Example Answer:
The list P is created with a length of N + 1, all initialized to 0. N and Q are obtained from the input, and S is assigned the raw input. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are assigned specific integer values obtained from the input split by space, S is assigned the raw input, P is a list of length N + 1 initialized with 0.
Output State: **N and Q are assigned specific integer values obtained from the input split by space, S is assigned the raw input, P is a list of length N + 1 initialized with 0**
