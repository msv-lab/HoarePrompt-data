Output State: **If N is greater than 0, after the loop executes P will contain the number of times the substring 'AC' appears in consecutive pairs in string S. If i is equal to 0, P[0] will be 0, and the loop will continue. In all other cases, if the substring from index (i - 1) to index (i + 1) in string S is equal to 'AC', then P[i] will be incremented by 1. Otherwise, P[i] will remain the same as P[i - 1]. If N is 0, the loop will not execute, and all elements of P will remain 0.**
