Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, Q and S have specific integer values, P is a list of length N + 1 initialized with 0. If i is equal to 0, then P[0] is set to 0 and the loop continues. In all other cases, there is no change in the values of N, Q, S, and the elements of P. If the substring from index (i - 1) to index (i + 1) in string S is equal to 'AC', then P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1] + 1. Otherwise, P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1].***
