Postcondition: ***N is greater than 1, Q and S have specific integer values, P is a list of length N + 1 initialized with 0, i is less than N, P[0] is 0. If S[i - 1:i + 1] is equal to 'AC', then P[i] is incremented by 1. Otherwise, P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1]. After the if block executes, the program continues without any changes to the initial state.***
