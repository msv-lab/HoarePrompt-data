Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, Q is assigned a value extracted from input, S is assigned the value of raw_input(), P is a list of zeros with length N + 1, i is 0. If i is equal to 0, then P[0] is set to 0 and the program execution continues. Otherwise, there are no changes to the initial state of the variables.***
