Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, Q is assigned a value extracted from input, S is assigned the value of raw_input(), P is a list of zeros with length N + 1, i is 0. If i is equal to 0, then P[0] is set to 0. If the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1 is 'AC', then P[i] is incremented by 1. Otherwise, P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1].***
