Output State: **For each iteration i from 0 to N, if S[i - 1:i + 1] is 'AC', P[i] is updated to be P[i - 1] + 1. If S[i - 1:i + 1] is not 'AC', P[i] remains the same as P[i - 1]. The loop will not execute if N is 0. Therefore, if N is 0, P will remain a list of zeros with length 1 and P[0] will be 0.**
