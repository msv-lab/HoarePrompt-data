Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, Q is assigned a value extracted from input, S is assigned the value of raw_input(), P is a list of zeros with length N + 1 where P[0] is 0. If i is equal to 0, P[0] is set to 0 and the program continues to the next iteration. For the next iteration, if S[i - 1:i + 1] is equal to 'AC', the loop will go into the if condition. If S[i - 1:i + 1] is not equal to 'AC', the loop will go into the else condition. No other states are adjusted for the loop to execute another iteration.***
