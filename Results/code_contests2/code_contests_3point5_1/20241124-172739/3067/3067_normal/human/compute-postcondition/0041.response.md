Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values N, Q, and a string S. It then processes a series of queries where each query consists of integers l and r to determine the difference in the cumulative occurrences of 'AC' in the substrings of S. The function prints this difference for each query. The function handles cases where N is 0 by keeping P as a list of zeros with length 1 and P[0] as 0.**
