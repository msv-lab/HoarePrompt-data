Example Answer:
The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`, where `i` is a positive integer greater than 0. Since the initial state has `P[0]` set to 0, and `i` is not specified, the value of `P[i]` remains the same as `P[i - 1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: *N is greater than 0, Q is assigned a value extracted from input, S is assigned the value of raw_input(), P is a list of zeros with length N + 1 where P[0] is 0, and P[i] is equal to P[i - 1].
Output State: **N is greater than 0, Q is assigned a value extracted from input, S is assigned the value of raw_input(), P is a list of zeros with length N + 1 where P[0] is 0, and P[i] is equal to P[i - 1]**
