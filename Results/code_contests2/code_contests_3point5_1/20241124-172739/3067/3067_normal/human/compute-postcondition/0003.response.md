According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If N is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, N is assigned a value extracted from input does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `N` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is assigned a value extracted from input, `S` is assigned the value of raw_input(), `P` is a list of zeros with length N + 1, `i` is 0**
