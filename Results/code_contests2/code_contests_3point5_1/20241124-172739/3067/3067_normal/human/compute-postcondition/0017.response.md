Output State: N is greater than 0, Q is assigned a value extracted from input, S is assigned the value of raw_input(), P is a list of zeros with length N + 1 where P[0] is 0. If i is equal to 0, P[0] is set to 0 and the program continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1] + 1.
