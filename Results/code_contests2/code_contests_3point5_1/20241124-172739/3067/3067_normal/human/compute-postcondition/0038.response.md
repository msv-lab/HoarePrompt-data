According to the code, the loop will execute Q times. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `Q` should be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.
- `l` and `r` should be assigned new values after mapping them to integers.
- `_` should be less than Q.
State: **`Q` is at least 2, `N` is greater than 0, `P` is a list of zeros with length 1 and P[0] is 0, `l` and `r` are assigned new values after mapping them to integers, the difference between `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` is 0, `_` is less than `Q`, and the code prints the result of `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]**
