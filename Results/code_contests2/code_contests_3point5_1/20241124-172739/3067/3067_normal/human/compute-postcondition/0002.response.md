Example Answer:
A list `P` is created with a length of `N + 1` filled with zeros. The values of `N` and `Q` are unknown, and `S` is a string obtained from `raw_input()`. Therefore, the output state is: N is assigned a value extracted from input, Q is assigned a value extracted from input, S is assigned the value of raw_input(), P is a list of zeros with length N + 1.
Output State: **N is assigned a value extracted from input, Q is assigned a value extracted from input, S is assigned the value of raw_input(), P is a list of zeros with length N + 1**
