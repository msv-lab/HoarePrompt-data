According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `_` is less than `Q`. At the end of the last iteration, `Q` is at least 1, `N` is greater than 0, `P` is a list of zeros with length 1 and P[0] is 0, `l` and `r` are assigned values from the input after mapping them to integers, and the difference between `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `_` needs to be less than `Q + 1` since the loop starts from 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`Q` is at least 1, `N` is greater than 0, `P` is a list of zeros with length 1 and P[0] is 0, `l` and `r` are assigned values from the input after mapping them to integers, and the difference between `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` is 0, `_` is less than `Q + 1**.
