Output State: **If N is greater than 0, the loop will update P based on the conditions stated. P will contain the cumulative sum of the occurrences where S[i - 1:i + 1] is 'AC'. If N is 0, P will remain a list of zeros with length 1 and P[0] will be 0. l and r will be assigned values from the input after mapping them to integers. The code will print the difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1].**
