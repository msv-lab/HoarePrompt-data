Output State: **N is greater than 0, Q is assigned a value extracted from input, S is assigned the value of raw_input(), P is a list where P[0] is 0, and P[i] is equal to P[i - 1] + 1 for the current iteration i. If S[i - 1:i + 1] is equal to 'AC', the loop goes into the if condition; otherwise, it goes into the else condition.**
