Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, Q is assigned a value extracted from input, S is assigned the value of raw_input(), P is a list of zeros with length N + 1 where P[0] is 0. For each iteration i, if S[i - 1:i + 1] is equal to 'AC', P[i] is updated to be P[i - 1] + 1. If S[i - 1:i + 1] is not equal to 'AC', P[i] remains the same as P[i - 1]. The loop iterates through all possible values of i from 0 to N. No other states are adjusted for the loop to execute another iteration.***
