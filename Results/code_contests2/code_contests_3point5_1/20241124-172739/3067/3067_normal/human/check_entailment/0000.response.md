Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input values N, Q, and a string S as described in the problem.
- It then processes a series of queries where each query consists of integers l and r to determine the difference in the cumulative occurrences of 'AC' in the substrings of S.
- The code correctly calculates the occurrences of 'AC' in the substrings by maintaining a list P where P[i] stores the number of occurrences of 'AC' in the substring ending at index i.
- For each query, the code calculates the difference in the cumulative occurrences of 'AC' between the substrings ending at index r and l, and prints the result.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case and handles the queries correctly.
