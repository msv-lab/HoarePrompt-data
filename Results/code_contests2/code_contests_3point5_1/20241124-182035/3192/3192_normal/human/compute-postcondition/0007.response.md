According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `arr1[0]` should be a positive integer. Additionally, `j` should be initialized to 1 since the loop starts from 1. 
State: **`arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values to integers, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is a positive integer**
