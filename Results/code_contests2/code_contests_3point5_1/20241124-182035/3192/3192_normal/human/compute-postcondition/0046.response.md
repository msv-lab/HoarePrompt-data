According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains the previous values with temp appended, `arr2` appends `arr1[0], and `maxval` is updated with the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented, and `n` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.
State: **`arr` contains the previous values with temp appended, `arr2` appends `arr1[0], `maxval` is updated with the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`, `i` is incremented, `n` is greater than or equal to the new value of `i`**
