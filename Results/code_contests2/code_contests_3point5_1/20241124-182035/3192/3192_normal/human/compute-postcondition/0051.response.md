According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1`, `arr`, and `arr2` are empty lists, `maxval` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `ans` is updated with the value of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr1` is an empty list, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is updated with the value of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`**
