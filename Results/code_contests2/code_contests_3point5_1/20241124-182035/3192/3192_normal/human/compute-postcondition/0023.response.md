According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1` is a list with values obtained from user input converted to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `arr1[0]` which implies `j` needs to be less than the current value of `arr1[0]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr1` is a list with values obtained from user input converted to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list, `arr2` is a list, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `maxval` is the maximum value, `n` is greater than the current value of `arr1[0]`**
