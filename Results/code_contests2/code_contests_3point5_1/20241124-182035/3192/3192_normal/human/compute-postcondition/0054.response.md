Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. The previous values of variables are as follows: `arr1` is an empty list, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. After the calculation, the new value of `ans` is added to the existing value. 
Output State: **`arr1` is an empty list, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated with the new value**
