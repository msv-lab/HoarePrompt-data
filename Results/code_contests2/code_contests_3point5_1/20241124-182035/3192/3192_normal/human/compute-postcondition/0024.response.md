Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` changes based on the comparison with `arr1[j]`. The initial state mentions that `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, so `temp` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr1` is a list with values obtained from user input converted to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list, `arr2` is a list, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `maxval` is the maximum value, `n` is greater than the current value of `arr1[0]`.
Output State: **`arr1` is a list with values obtained from user input converted to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list, `arr2` is a list, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `maxval` is the maximum value, `n` is greater than the current value of `arr1[0]`**
