Output State: **The loop calculates the maximum value in each list `arr1` up to the index `arr1[0]` and appends it to the list `arr`. The loop also appends the first element of `arr1` to the list `arr2`. The variable `maxval` is updated to hold the maximum value found so far between all the lists. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and all variables remain at their initial values.**
