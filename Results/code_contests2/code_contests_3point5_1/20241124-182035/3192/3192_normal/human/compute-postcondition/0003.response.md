Example Answer:
`arr2` is assigned an empty list, so `arr2` is an empty list. The other variables `arr` and `maxval` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, and `arr2` is an empty list.
Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, and `arr2` is an empty list**
