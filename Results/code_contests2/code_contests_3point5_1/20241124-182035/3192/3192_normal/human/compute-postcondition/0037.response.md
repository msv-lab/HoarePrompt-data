According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to less than `arr1[0]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` is a list with values obtained from user input converted to integers, `arr2` is a list with the first element of `arr1` appended, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and the element at index `j` in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `n` is greater than `arr1[0] + 1`, `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`**
