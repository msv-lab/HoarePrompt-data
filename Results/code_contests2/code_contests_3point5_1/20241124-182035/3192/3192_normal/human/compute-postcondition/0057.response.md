Output State: **If n is less than or equal to 0, `ans` is 0, `arr1`, `arr`, and `arr2` are empty lists, `maxval` is 0, and `n` is less than or equal to 0. If n is greater than 0, after executing the loop n times, `ans` will be updated with the value of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each iteration. After the loop, `arr1`, `arr`, and `arr2` remain empty lists, `maxval` remains 0, and `n` is greater than 0.**
