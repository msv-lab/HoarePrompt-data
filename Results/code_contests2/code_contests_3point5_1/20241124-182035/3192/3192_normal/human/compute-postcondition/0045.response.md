Example Answer:
`maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`. The value of `maxval` is updated based on the comparison with the value at index `i` in the list `arr`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` contains the previous values with temp appended, `arr2` appends `arr1[0] and maxval is updated with the maximum value between arr[i] and maxval.
Output State: **`arr` contains the previous values with temp appended, `arr2` appends `arr1[0] and `maxval` is updated with the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`**
