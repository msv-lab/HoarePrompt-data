According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and `arr1[0]` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and should be less than `arr1[0]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values to integers, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 4, `arr1[0]` is a positive integer, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[3], `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `temp` and the value of `arr1[j]`**
