According to the code, the loop will only execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `arr1`, `arr`, and `arr2` are empty lists, they don't affect the loop execution directly. The initial value of `maxval` being 0 doesn't impact the loop execution either. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to set `n` to be greater than 0 and set `i` to be 0.
State: **`arr1` is an empty list, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
