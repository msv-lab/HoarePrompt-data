According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, and `arr2` is an empty list. To ensure the loop executes, `n` needs to be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
