Functionality: **The function reads an integer n from the user, then iterates n times. For each iteration, it reads a list of integers and calculates the maximum value up to the specified index in that list. It then stores the maximum value in a new list arr, and the first element of the input list in another list arr2. The function then calculates the total salary cost by summing the product of the differences between the maximum value and each element in arr, multiplied by the corresponding element in arr2. Finally, it prints the total salary cost.**
