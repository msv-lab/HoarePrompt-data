Output State: **If n is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. In this case, `ans` remains 0, `arr1`, `arr`, and `arr2` remain empty lists, `maxval` remains 0, and `n` is less than or equal to 0. If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute n times, updating `ans` with the value of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each iteration. After the loop executes, `arr1`, `arr`, `arr2` remain empty lists, `maxval` remains 0, and `n` is greater than 0.**
