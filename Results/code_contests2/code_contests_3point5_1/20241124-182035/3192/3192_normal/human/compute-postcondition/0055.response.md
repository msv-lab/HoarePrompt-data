According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr1` is an empty list, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `ans` is updated with the new value**
