Example Answer:
`maxval` is updated by taking the maximum value between the current element of `arr` and the previous value of `maxval`. The value of `maxval` depends on the elements of `arr`, so it could change based on user input. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list with values obtained from user input converted to integers, `arr2` is a list with the first element of `arr1` appended, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `n` is greater than the current value of `arr1[0]`.
Output State: **`arr` is a list with values obtained from user input converted to integers, `arr2` is a list with the first element of `arr1` appended, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `n` is greater than the current value of `arr1[0]`**
