According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will iterate from 1 up to `arr1[0] - 1`. So, for the loop to execute, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. 

Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **`arr1` is a list with values obtained from user input converted to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list, `arr2` is a list, `temp` is 0, `maxval` is the maximum value, `n` is greater than the current value**
