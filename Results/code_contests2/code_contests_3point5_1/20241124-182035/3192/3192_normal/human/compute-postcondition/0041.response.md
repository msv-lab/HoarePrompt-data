According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `arr1[0] + 1` which means the loop can execute again. `arr1[0]` is at least 2, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `arr1[0]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` is a list with values obtained from user input converted to integers, `arr2` is a list with the first element of `arr1` appended, `temp` is the maximum value between the previous value of `temp` and the element at index `j` in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `n` is greater than `arr1[0] + 1`, `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`**
