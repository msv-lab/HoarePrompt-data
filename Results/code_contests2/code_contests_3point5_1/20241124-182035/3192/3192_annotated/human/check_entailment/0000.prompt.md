You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A conglomerate consists of n companies. To make managing easier, their owners have decided to merge all companies into one. By law, it is only possible to merge two companies, so the owners plan to select two companies, merge them into one, and continue doing so until there is only one company left.

But anti-monopoly service forbids to merge companies if they suspect unfriendly absorption. The criterion they use is the difference in maximum salaries between two companies. Merging is allowed only if the maximum salaries are equal.

To fulfill the anti-monopoly requirements, the owners can change salaries in their companies before merging. But the labor union insists on two conditions: it is only allowed to increase salaries, moreover all the employees in one company must get the same increase.

Sure enough, the owners want to minimize the total increase of all salaries in all companies. Help them find the minimal possible increase that will allow them to merge companies into one.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n — the number of companies in the conglomerate (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). Each of the next n lines describes a company. 

A company description start with an integer m_i — the number of its employees (1 ≤ m_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). Then m_i integers follow: the salaries of the employees. All salaries are positive and do not exceed 10^9. 

The total number of employees in all companies does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. 

Output

Output a single integer — the minimal total increase of all employees that allows to merge all companies.

Example

Input


3
2 4 3
2 2 1
3 1 1 1


Output


13

Note

One of the optimal merging strategies is the following. First increase all salaries in the second company by 2, and merge the first and the second companies. Now the conglomerate consists of two companies with salaries [4, 3, 4, 3] and [1, 1, 1]. To merge them, increase the salaries in the second of those by 3. The total increase is 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = []
    maxval = 0
    arr2 = []
    for i in xrange(n):
        arr1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        
        temp = 0
        
        for j in xrange(1, arr1[0]):
            temp = max(temp, arr1[j])
        
        arr.append(temp)
        
        arr2.append(arr1[0])
        
        maxval = max(arr[i], maxval)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If n is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, arr will contain the maximum value of each input list, arr2 will contain the length of each input list, maxval will be the maximum value between all elements in arr. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute and maxval remains 0.
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute n times. After the loop executes, ans will be updated based on the calculations involving maxval, arr, and arr2 at each index i. If n is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and ans will remain 0.
    print(ans)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
