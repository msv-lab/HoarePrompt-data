You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: A conglomerate consists of n companies. To make managing easier, their owners have decided to merge all companies into one. By law, it is only possible to merge two companies, so the owners plan to select two companies, merge them into one, and continue doing so until there is only one company left.

But anti-monopoly service forbids to merge companies if they suspect unfriendly absorption. The criterion they use is the difference in maximum salaries between two companies. Merging is allowed only if the maximum salaries are equal.

To fulfill the anti-monopoly requirements, the owners can change salaries in their companies before merging. But the labor union insists on two conditions: it is only allowed to increase salaries, moreover all the employees in one company must get the same increase.

Sure enough, the owners want to minimize the total increase of all salaries in all companies. Help them find the minimal possible increase that will allow them to merge companies into one.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n — the number of companies in the conglomerate (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). Each of the next n lines describes a company. 

A company description start with an integer m_i — the number of its employees (1 ≤ m_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). Then m_i integers follow: the salaries of the employees. All salaries are positive and do not exceed 10^9. 

The total number of employees in all companies does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. 

Output

Output a single integer — the minimal total increase of all employees that allows to merge all companies.

Example

Input


3
2 4 3
2 2 1
3 1 1 1


Output


13

Note

One of the optimal merging strategies is the following. First increase all salaries in the second company by 2, and merge the first and the second companies. Now the conglomerate consists of two companies with salaries [4, 3, 4, 3] and [1, 1, 1]. To merge them, increase the salaries in the second of those by 3. The total increase is 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13.
Program:
```

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = []
    maxval = 0
    arr2 = []
    for i in xrange(n):
        arr1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        temp = 0
        for j in xrange(1, arr1[0]):
            temp = max(temp, arr1[j])
        arr.append(temp)
        arr2.append(arr1[0])
        maxval = max(arr[i], maxval)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]
    print(ans)
```
