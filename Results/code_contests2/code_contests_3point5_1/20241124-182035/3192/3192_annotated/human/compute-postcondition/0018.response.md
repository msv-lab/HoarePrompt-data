According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers from input with `temp` appended at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`, `arr2` has been updated with the value of `arr1[0] appended at the end**
