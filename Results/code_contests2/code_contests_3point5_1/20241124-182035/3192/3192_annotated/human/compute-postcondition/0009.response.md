According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and the condition `j < arr1[0]` needs to be satisfied. Also, `arr1[j]` needs to be considered when updating the state.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers from input, `maxval` is updated based on the loop condition, `arr2` and `temp` may need updates, `j` is 2, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`**
