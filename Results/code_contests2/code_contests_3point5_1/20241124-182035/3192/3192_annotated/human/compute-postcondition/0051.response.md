According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is updated based on the calculation involving `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` at index `i`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next index after the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculation involving `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` at index `i+1`**
