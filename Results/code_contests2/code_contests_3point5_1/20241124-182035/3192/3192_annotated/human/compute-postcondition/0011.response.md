According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3 because it should be less than `arr1[0]`, and `temp` needs to be updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[3]` since `j` is now 3.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers from input, `maxval` is updated based on the loop condition, `arr2` and `temp` may need updates, `j` is 3, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[3]`**
