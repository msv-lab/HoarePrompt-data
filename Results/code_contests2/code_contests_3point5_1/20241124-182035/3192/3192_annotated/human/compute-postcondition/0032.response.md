According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is greater than or equal to 1, i is 2, arr is a list of integers from input with temp appended at the end, maxval is the maximum value between arr[i] and maxval, arr2 has been updated with the value of arr1[0] appended at the end, arr1 is a list of integers from input, temp is the maximum value between temp and arr1[j] where temp is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and arr1[j], and if arr1[0] is less than 2, the loop does not execute and temp remains 0. arr2 has been appended with the value of arr1[0]**
