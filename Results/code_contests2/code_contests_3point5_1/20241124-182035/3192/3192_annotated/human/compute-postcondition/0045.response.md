Example Answer:
The variable `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`. The previous values of `maxval`, `arr1`, `temp`, and `arr` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact value. Therefore, the output state is: `arr1`, `temp`, and `arr` retain their previous values, and `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` contains the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`.
Output State: **`arr1`, `temp`, and `arr` retain their previous values, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` contains the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`**
