Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` to it. The values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are not provided, so the exact calculation cannot be determined. The variables `i` and `n` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated based on the calculation involving `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` at index `i+1`; `i` is `i+1`; `n` is greater than `i+1`.
Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculation involving `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` at index `i+1`; `i` is `i+1`; `n` is greater than `i+1`**
