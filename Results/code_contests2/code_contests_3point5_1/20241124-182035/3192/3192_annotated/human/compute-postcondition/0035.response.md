According to the code, the loop will execute if arr1[0] is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, arr1[0] is less than 2 which means the loop will not execute. In order for the loop to execute, arr1[0] needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2 and j should be 1.
State: **n is greater than or equal to 1, i is 2, arr is a list of integers from input with temp appended at the end, maxval is the maximum value between arr[i] and maxval, arr2 has been updated with the value of arr1[0] appended at the end, arr1 is a list of integers from input, temp is the maximum value between temp and arr1[j] where temp is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and arr1[j], and if arr1[0] is less than 2, the loop does not execute and temp remains 0. arr2 has been appended with the value of arr1[0], arr1[0] is greater than or equal to 2, j is 1**
