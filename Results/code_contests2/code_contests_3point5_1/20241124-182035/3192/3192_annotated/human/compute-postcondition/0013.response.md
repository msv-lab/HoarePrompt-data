According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented and be less than the updated value of `arr1[0]`. Also, `arr2` and `temp` may need updates based on the loop body. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers from input, `maxval` is updated based on the loop condition, `arr2` may need updates, `temp` may need updates based on the loop body, `j` is 4, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
