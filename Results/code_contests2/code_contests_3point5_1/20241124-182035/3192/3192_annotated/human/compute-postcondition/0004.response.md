According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `arr` is empty, `maxval` is 0, and `arr2` is empty. To ensure the loop executes, the state should be adjusted so that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is set to 0, and `xrange` should be replaced with `range` for Python 3 compatibility.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list**
