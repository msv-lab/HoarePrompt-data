Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers from input, `maxval` is the maximum value between `maxval` and `arr1[j]` where `j` ranges from 1 to `arr1[0]`, `arr2` may need updates, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, unless `arr1` is empty, then `temp` is 0. If `arr1[0]` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute and `temp` remains 0**
