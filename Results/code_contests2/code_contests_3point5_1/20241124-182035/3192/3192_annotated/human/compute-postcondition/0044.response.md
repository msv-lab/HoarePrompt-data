Example Answer:
The first element of `arr1` is appended to `arr2`. The values of `arr1`, `temp`, and `arr` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: arr1, temp, and arr have their previous values, and arr2 contains the first element of arr1.
Output State: **arr1, temp, and arr have their previous values, arr2 contains the first element of arr1**
