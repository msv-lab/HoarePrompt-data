Example Answer: 
`temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` depends on the comparison with `arr1[j]`, and the previous values of `temp` and `arr1[j]` are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is:  `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers from input, `maxval` is updated based on the loop condition, `arr2` and `temp` may need updates, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers from input, `maxval` is updated based on the loop condition, `arr2` and `temp` may need updates, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`**
