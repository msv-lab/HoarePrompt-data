Example Answer:
If arr1[0] is less than 2, the loop does not execute and temp remains 0. If arr1[0] is greater than or equal to 2, temp is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and arr1[j] where j is the last index of arr1. After the loop, the value of temp is appended to the list arr.
Output State: **The values of arr1, temp, and arr are updated based on the conditions mentioned.**
