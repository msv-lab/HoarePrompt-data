According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `arr1[0]` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `arr1[0]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers from input with `temp` appended at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`, `arr2` has been updated with the value of `arr1[0]` appended at the end, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j] where `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]**
