Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` at index `i+1`. The previous values of variables `ans`, `maxval`, `arr`, `arr2`, and `i` are unknown, so the output state is: `ans` is updated based on the calculation involving `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` at index `i+1`.
Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculation involving `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` at index `i+1`**
