Output State: **The loop iterates through the elements of arr1 starting from index 1 up to arr1[0] - 1. It updates the value of temp to be the maximum value between its current value and arr1[j] for each iteration. After the loop executes, n is greater than or equal to 1, i is 1, arr is a list of integers from input with temp appended at the end, maxval is the maximum value between arr[i] and maxval, arr2 has been updated with the value of arr1[0] appended at the end, arr1 is a list of integers from input, temp is the maximum value between temp and arr1[j] where temp is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and arr1[j]. If arr1[0] is less than 2, the loop does not execute and temp remains 0.**
