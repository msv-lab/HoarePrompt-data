According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being greater than or equal to 1, and `i` being 0 do not directly impact the loop execution, so they can remain as they are. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `arr1[0]` should be greater than 1, `j` should be initialized to 1, `maxval` should be updated based on the loop condition, `arr2` and `temp` may need updates based on loop body operations.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers from input, `maxval` is updated based on the loop condition, `arr2` and `temp` may need updates, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
