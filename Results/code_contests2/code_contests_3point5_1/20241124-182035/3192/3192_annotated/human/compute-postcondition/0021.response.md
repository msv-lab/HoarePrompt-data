According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than or equal to 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers from input with `temp` appended at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`, `arr2` has been updated with the value of `arr1[0]` appended at the end, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers from input with `temp` appended at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`, `arr2` has been updated with the value of `arr1[0]` appended at the end, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is at least 2**
