According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is updated based on the calculation involving `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` at index `i+1`; `i` is `i+1`; `n` is greater than `i+1`. Since `i` is `i+1`, it means the next iteration will involve `i+1` as well. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than `i+2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculation involving `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` at index `i+1`; `i` is `i+1`; `n` is greater than `i+2`**
