Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int()` converts it to an integer. Since `n` represents the number of companies in the conglomerate, the value of `n` is now set to the input provided. 
Output State: **`n` is the input integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate**
