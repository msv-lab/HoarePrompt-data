According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1`, `temp`, and `arr` retain their previous values, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` contains the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`arr1`, `temp`, and `arr` retain their previous values, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` contains the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`, `i` is incremented by 1**
