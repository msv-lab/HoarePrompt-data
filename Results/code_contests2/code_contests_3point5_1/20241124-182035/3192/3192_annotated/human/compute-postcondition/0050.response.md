Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. The initial value of `ans` is 0, `i` starts at 0, and `n` is greater than 0. The updated value of `ans` will depend on the values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` at index `i`. 
Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculation involving `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` at index `i`.**
