The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, then iterates `n` times to read a list of integers. It calculates the maximum value in each list, calculates the maximum value of all maximums, and then computes a value `ans` based on the differences between the maximum value and each list's maximum value multiplied by the length of the list. Finally, it prints the result `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and is designed to analyze a conglomerate of companies based on the provided input.
