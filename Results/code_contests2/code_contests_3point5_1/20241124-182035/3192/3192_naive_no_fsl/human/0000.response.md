Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, calculates the maximum salary in each company, finds the overall maximum salary, and then calculates the minimal total increase needed to merge all companies while maintaining the anti-monopoly requirements. The logic used in the program is sound and follows the problem description provided. The program iterates through each company, calculates the difference between the maximum salary and the overall maximum salary, and then adds this difference multiplied by the number of employees in the company to the total increase. This approach ensures that the minimal total increase is calculated accurately. Overall, the program is correct as it meets all the requirements and produces the expected output.
