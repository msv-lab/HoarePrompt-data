Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where the maximum salary of the companies is not the same, which is a requirement according to the problem description. The program only calculates the total increase based on the maximum salary of each company, but it does not consider adjusting the salaries to make the maximum salaries equal before merging the companies. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
