Example Answer: 
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split(' '))`. The values of `n` and `k` are dependent on the input given by the user, so their specific values cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from user input.
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from user input**
