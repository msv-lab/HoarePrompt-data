Output State: **If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop calculates the sum of elements in the `arr` list starting from index 1 up to `k` (inclusive) and adds this sum to the initial value of `ans`. After the loop executes, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is assigned a value from user input, `k` is one less than `n` and greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, and `ans` is updated to be the sum of the elements in `arr` based on the loop's execution.**
