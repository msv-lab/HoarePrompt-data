According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is assigned a value from user input, `k` is one less than `n` and greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on user input, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the sorted list `arr`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is adjusted to be `n - 1`.**
