Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from the user, sorts it in descending order, calculates the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted list, and prints the result. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is adjusted to `n - 1`. The function repeats this process `t` times for different sets of inputs. The function does not explicitly return any value. However, it handles the calculation and printing of sums based on the specified constraints and relationships.**
