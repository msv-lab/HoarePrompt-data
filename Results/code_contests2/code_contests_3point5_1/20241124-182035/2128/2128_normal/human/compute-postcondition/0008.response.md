Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from user input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is updated to `n - 1` while retaining the initial state of other variables.***
