According to the code, the loop will execute 't' times. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from user input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`. 
To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` should be updated to `n - 1`.
- If `k` is negative or 0, `ans` should remain the initial value of the first element in `arr`.
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from user input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`.**
