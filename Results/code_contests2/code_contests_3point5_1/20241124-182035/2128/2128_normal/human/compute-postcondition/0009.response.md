According to the code, for the loop to execute, the loop variable `l` needs to be within the range of 1 to `k + 1`. Therefore, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, since `k` is updated to `n - 1` if it is greater than or equal to `n`, we need to ensure that `k` is not greater than or equal to `n`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from user input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`, `k` is less than `n`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `l` is 1**
