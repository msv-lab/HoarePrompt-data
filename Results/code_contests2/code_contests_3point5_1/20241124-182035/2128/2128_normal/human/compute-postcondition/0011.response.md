According to the code, the loop will execute again if `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from user input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`, `k` is less than `n`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `l` is 1, and `ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of `arr`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `l` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from user input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`, `k` is less than `n`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `l` is 2, `ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of `arr`.**
