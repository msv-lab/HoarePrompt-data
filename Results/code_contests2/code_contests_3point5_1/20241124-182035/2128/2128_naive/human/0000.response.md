Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The given program is incorrect. 
For example, if there are 3 barrels with initial amounts of water [5, 5, 5] and k = 2, the program will output 15 as the maximum possible difference between the maximum and minimum amount of water. However, the correct answer should be 10. 
This is because the program does not handle the pouring process correctly. It simply sums up the first k maximum amounts of water, which may not represent the actual maximum possible difference in all cases.
