Example Answer: 
`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input after splitting it. The values of `n` and `k` are now determined by the input. There are no changes to other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is either the sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr` if `k` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `ans` is the first element of `arr`.
Output State: **`ans` is either the sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr` if `k` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `ans` is the first element of `arr`**
