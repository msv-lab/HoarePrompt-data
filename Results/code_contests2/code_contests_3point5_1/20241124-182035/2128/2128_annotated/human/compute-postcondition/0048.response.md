Output State: **If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is set to `n - 1`. The loop calculates the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted list `arr` and updates `ans` accordingly. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop will execute `k` times, updating `ans` each time by adding the value at index `l` in `arr`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will execute `n - 1` times. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains the largest integer in the list `arr`.**
