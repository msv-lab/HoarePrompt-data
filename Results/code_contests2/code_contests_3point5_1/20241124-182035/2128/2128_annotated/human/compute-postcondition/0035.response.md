Example Answer: 
`n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input from `sys.stdin.readline().split(' ')`. The values of `n` and `k` are updated accordingly. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are updated based on the input values.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated based on the input values**
