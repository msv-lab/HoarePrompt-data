According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is updated based on the value of `arr[l+1]`, and `k` is adjusted if necessary. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1, and `k` may need to be adjusted based on the new value of `k`. 
State: **`ans` is updated based on the value of `arr[l+1]`, `l` is incremented, `k` may be adjusted**
