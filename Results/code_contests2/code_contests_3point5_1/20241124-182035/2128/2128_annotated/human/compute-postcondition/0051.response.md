Output State: **If `t` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute and calculate the sum of elements in `arr` based on the value of `k` and the length of `arr`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is adjusted to `n - 1`. If `k` is less than 1 or `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute. After the loop executes, `ans` will hold the sum of selected elements in `arr`, and `k` may be modified based on its initial value and the size of `arr`.**
