Output State: **The loop calculates the sum of elements in `arr` starting from the second element (index 1) up to the element at index `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is adjusted to `n - 1`. If `arr` has less than 2 elements or `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. After the loop executes, `ans` will be the sum of the selected elements in `arr`, and `k` may be adjusted based on its initial value and the length of `arr`.**
