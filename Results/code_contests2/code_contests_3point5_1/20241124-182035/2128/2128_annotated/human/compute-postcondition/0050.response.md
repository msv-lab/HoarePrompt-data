According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop will execute `k` times. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will execute `n - 1` times. At the end of the last iteration, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is set to `n - 1`. We need to adjust `k` to be less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is set to `n - 1`.**
