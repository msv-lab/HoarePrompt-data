Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `arr`, which is already sorted in descending order. Therefore, `ans` will be the largest integer in the list `arr`. The states of the other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated based on the input values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in the list `arr`**
