Example Answer: 
The value of `ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of the sorted array `arr`. The variable `l` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `ans` and `l` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` and `k` are updated based on the input values, `k` is less than `n`, `arr` remains unchanged and is still sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated, `l` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated based on the input values, `k` is less than `n`, `arr` remains unchanged and is still sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated, `l` is increased by 1**
