According to the code, the loop can execute if the variables `l` and `k` satisfy the specified range condition. In this case, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. 

To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values obtained by mapping integers from the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
