Example Answer: 
`ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it. The value of `arr[l]` is not known from the initial state. The value of `ans` is updated accordingly. The value of `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated based on the value of `arr[l+1]`, `k` is adjusted if necessary.
Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the value of `arr[l+1]`, `k` is adjusted if necessary**
