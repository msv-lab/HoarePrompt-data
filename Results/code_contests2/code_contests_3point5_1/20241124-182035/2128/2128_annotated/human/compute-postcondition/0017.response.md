Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `ans`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` will be the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`. If `k` is less than 1, `ans` will remain as the first element of `arr`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is either the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr` if `k` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `ans` is the first element of `arr`.
Output State: **`ans` is either the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr` if `k` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `ans` is the first element of `arr`**
