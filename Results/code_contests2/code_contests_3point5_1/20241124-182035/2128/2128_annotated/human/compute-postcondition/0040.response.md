Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are updated based on the input values. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is set to `n - 1`. The list `arr` remains unchanged and is still sorted in descending order. `ans` remains the largest integer in the list `arr`. In all other cases not covered by the if condition, `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `ans` retain their original values.***
