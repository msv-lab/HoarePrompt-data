According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is updated based on the value of `arr[l+1]`, `l` is incremented, `k` may be adjusted. To execute the loop one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1 and `k` may be adjusted based on the specific condition in the loop body. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ans` is updated based on the value of `arr[l+1]`, `l` is incremented by 1, `k` may be adjusted**
