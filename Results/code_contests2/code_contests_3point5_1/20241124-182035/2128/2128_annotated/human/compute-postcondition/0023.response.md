Example Answer: 
`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, but the initial state of `n` is unknown. However, `ans` is the first element of `arr`, so `ans` is affected by the code indirectly. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the first element of `arr`, `k` is `n - 1`.
Output State: **`ans` is the first element of `arr`, `k` is `n - 1`**
