According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is updated based on the value of `arr[l]`, and k is adjusted if necessary. To execute the loop one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1, and `k` needs to be adjusted accordingly. 
State: **`ans` is updated based on the value of `arr[l+1]`, `k` is adjusted if necessary**
