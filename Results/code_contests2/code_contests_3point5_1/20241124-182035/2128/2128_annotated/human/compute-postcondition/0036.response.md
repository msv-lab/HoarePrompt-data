Example Answer:
The list `arr` is created by mapping the input values to integers using `map` and `int` functions. The input values are obtained from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`. The values of `n` and `k` are not explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are updated based on the input values, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated based on the input values, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
