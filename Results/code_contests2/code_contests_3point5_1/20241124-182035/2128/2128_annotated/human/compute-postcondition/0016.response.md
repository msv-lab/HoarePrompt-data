Output State: **The loop calculates the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted `arr` and updates the value of `ans` accordingly. If `k` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute and `ans` will be the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop will not execute and `ans` will remain as the first element of `arr`.**
