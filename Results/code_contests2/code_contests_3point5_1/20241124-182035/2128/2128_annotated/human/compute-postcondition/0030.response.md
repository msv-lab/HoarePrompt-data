Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]`. The value of `l` is then incremented by 1. The state of `k` is not explicitly mentioned, so it may or may not be affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated based on the value of `arr[l+1]`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `k` may be adjusted.
Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the value of `arr[l+1]`, `l` is incremented, `k` may be adjusted**
