Example Answer: 
`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, and `n` is updated based on the input value. The value of `arr` is not affected, and `ans` is the largest integer in the list `arr`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are updated based on the input values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in the list `arr`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated based on the input values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in the list `arr`**
