According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are updated based on the input values, `k` is less than `n`, `arr` remains unchanged and is still sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated, `l` is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, only `l` needs to be adjusted to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` and `k` are updated based on the input values, `k` is less than `n`, `arr` remains unchanged and is still sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated, `l` is increased by 2**
