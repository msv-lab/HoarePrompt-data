According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as t is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, it is unknown what the initial state is. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
