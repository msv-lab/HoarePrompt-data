According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is either the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr` if `k` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `ans` is the first element of `arr`. To execute the loop one more time, the `ans` value needs to be updated based on the condition mentioned. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then `ans` should be the sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr`, otherwise `ans` should be the first element of `arr`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`ans` is either the sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr` if `k` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `ans` is the first element of `arr`**
