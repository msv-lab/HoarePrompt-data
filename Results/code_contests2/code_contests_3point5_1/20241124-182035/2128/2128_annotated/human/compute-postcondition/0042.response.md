Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` in the list `arr`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are updated based on the input values. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is set to `n - 1`. The list `arr` remains unchanged and is still sorted in descending order. `ans` is updated by adding the value at index `l` in the list `arr`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated based on the input values. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is set to `n - 1`. The list `arr` remains unchanged and is still sorted in descending order. `ans` is updated by adding the value at index `l` in the list `arr`**
