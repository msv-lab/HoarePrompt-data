Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in descending order, and the original order of elements is updated based on the sorting. No changes are made to the variables `n` and `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are updated based on the input values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated based on the input values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**
