According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values obtained by mapping integers from the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr` plus the element at index `l`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is incremented, `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of `arr`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `l` needs to be incremented by 1 and `ans` should be incremented by the value at the next index of `arr`.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values obtained by mapping integers from the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr` plus the element at index `l`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is incremented to the next value, `ans` is incremented by the value at the next index of `arr`**
