The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the standard input and a list of integers `a`. If `n` equals 11, it prints 5. Then, it initializes a list `c` of 101 integers with zeros and iterates over the elements in list `a`, incrementing the corresponding index in list `c` by 1. Finally, the function prints the maximum value in list `c`. The functionality of the function is to find the maximum occurrence of an integer in the input list `a`.
