Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` will be the input integer. The list `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer and a is a list of integers with values between 1 and 100.
Output State: **n is a positive integer and a is a list of integers with values between 1 and 100**
