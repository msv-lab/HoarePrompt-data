Example Answer:
The value at index `d` of list `c` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `c` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with values between 1 and 100, and the element at index `d+1` of list `c` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with values between 1 and 100, and the element at index `d+1` of list `c` is incremented by 1**
