Example Answer: 
A list `c` is created with 101 elements, all initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `a` are not affected by this code. Since no action is taken unless `n` is 11, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with values between 1 and 100, c is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0**
