Example Answer:
The value of `d` is the first element in list `a`, so `d` takes on the value of the first integer in list `a`. Then, the element at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. Since `c` is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0, the element at index `d` in list `c` is now 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a non-empty list of integers with values between 1 and 100, c is a list of 101 integers with the element at index d incremented by 1, d is the first element in list a.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a non-empty list of integers with values between 1 and 100, c is a list of 101 integers with the element at index d incremented by 1, d is the first element in list a**
