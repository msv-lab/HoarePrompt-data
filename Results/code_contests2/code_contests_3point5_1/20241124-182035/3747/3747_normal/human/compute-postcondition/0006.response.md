According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in list `a`. The loop iterates over the elements in list `a`. Since `n` is not used within the loop, it does not need to be adjusted. 
Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that the loop can execute. The elements in list `a` determine the number of iterations. Therefore, the adjustment needed is that `a` must not be empty. Additionally, before the loop starts, `d` should be the first element in list `a`.
State: **n is a positive integer, a is a non-empty list of integers with values between 1 and 100, c is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0, d is the first element in list a**
