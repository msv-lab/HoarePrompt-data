Output State: **If `a` is a non-empty list of integers with values between 1 and 100, and `n` is a positive integer, then after the loop executes, `c` is a list of 101 integers with the element at index `d` incremented by 1 for each `d` in list `a`. If `a` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `c` remains a list of 101 integers initialized to 0.**
