Example Answer:
The value at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. The value of `d` is the next element in list `a`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with values between 1 and 100, `c` is a list of 101 integers with the element at index `d` incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with values between 1 and 100, `c` is a list of 101 integers with the element at index `d` incremented by 1**
