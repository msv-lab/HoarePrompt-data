Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is incorrectly handling the case when `n == 11` by directly printing `5` without performing the actual distribution of coins. This violates the requirement to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. The code should be modified to correctly distribute the coins among the pockets as described in the problem statement.
