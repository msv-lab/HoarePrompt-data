Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all the coins as per the problem description.

For example, if the input is:
```
6
1 2 4 3 3 2
```
The expected output should be 2, as the coins can be distributed into [1, 2, 3] and [2, 3, 4]. However, the program will output 3 instead of 2.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this specific case, making the Correctness as **False**.
