Example Answer: 
The value of `d` is the first element in list `a`, so `d` is the value of `a[0]`. The value of `d` ranges from 1 to 100. The element at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, a_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, list `a` contains the integers entered with at least 1 element, list `c` is initialized with 101 zeros, and the element at index `d` in list `c` is increased by 1.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, a_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, list `a` contains the integers entered with at least 1 element, list `c` is initialized with 101 zeros, and the element at index `d` in list `c` is increased by 1**
