Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` can be any integer between 1 and 100. 
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n.**
