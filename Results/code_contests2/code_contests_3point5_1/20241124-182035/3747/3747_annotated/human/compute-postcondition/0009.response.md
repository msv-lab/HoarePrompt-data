Example Answer:
The value at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the variables are known, so if `c[d]` was initially `x`, after execution it becomes `x+1`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, a_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, list `a` still contains elements to be processed, list `c` is still initialized with 101 zeros, and the element at index `d` in list `c` is increased by 1 for the current element.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, a_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, list `a` still contains elements to be processed, list `c` is still initialized with 101 zeros, and the element at index `d` in list `c` is increased by 1 for the current element**
