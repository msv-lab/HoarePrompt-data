Example Answer: 
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by mapping the input string to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The input is split by spaces, converted to integers, and stored in the list `a`. Since the input values are not specified, the output state is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, a_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, and list `a` contains the integers entered.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, a_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, and list `a` contains the integers entered**
