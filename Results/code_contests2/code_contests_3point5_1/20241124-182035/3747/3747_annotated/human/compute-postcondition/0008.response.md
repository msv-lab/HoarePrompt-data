According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements remaining in list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, the element at index `d` in list `c` was increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in list `a` needs to be processed. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the next element in list `a` needs to be selected for processing.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, a_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, list `a` still contains elements to be processed, list `c` is still initialized with 101 zeros, and the element at index `d` in list `c` is increased by 1 for the current element**
