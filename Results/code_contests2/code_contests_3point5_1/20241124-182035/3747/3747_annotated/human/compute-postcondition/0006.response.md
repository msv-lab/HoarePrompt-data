According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in list `a`. So, for the loop to execute, list `a` must have at least 1 element. At the start of the loop, list `c` is initialized with 101 zeros. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least 1 element, and the value of `d` should be the first element in list `a`.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, a_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, list `a` contains the integers entered with at least 1 element, list `c` is initialized with 101 zeros, d is the first element in list `a`**
