Example Answer: 
The loop increments the count of each element in list `a` by 1 in list `c`. If list `a` is empty, the loop does not execute, and list `c` remains initialized with 101 zeros. The `max` function returns the maximum value in list `c`, which is 0 since all elements in `c` are zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: list `a` is unchanged, list `c` contains 101 zeros, and the maximum value in list `c` is 0.
Output State: **list `a` is unchanged, list `c` contains 101 zeros, and the maximum value in list `c` is 0**
