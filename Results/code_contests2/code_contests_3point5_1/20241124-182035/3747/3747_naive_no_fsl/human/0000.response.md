Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it only considers a specific case (n == 11) and prints 5 without actually calculating the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all the coins. The program should find the maximum frequency of coins with different values to determine the minimum number of pockets needed, but it simply prints the maximum frequency without considering the problem description. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect.
