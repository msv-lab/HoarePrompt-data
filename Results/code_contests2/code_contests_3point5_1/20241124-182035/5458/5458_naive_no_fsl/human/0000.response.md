Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given conditions. It uses dynamic programming to iterate through all possible combinations of integers in the Bingo card and checks if the conditions are met. The program handles edge cases such as when the sum of integers is zero or when the size of the Bingo card is zero. Additionally, the program efficiently calculates the remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created without exceeding the memory limits. Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
