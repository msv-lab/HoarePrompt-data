Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given constraints. It iterates through each possible number, column, and sum, and updates the dynamic programming table accordingly. The final result is obtained by taking the modulo of the calculated value. The program seems to handle all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
