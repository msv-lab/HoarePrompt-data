Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) containing updated values. `j` is adjusted based on the loop conditions, `k` is the next value after the current value. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. This assignment covers all possible cases where the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, and `k` are in the specified range and conditions.***
