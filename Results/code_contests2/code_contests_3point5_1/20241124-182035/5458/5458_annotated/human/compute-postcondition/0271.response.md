Example Answer:
If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `mod` is an unknown value. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then the values remain unchanged. Since the initial values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `s` are unknown, the output state is not determinable.
Output State: **Not determinable**
