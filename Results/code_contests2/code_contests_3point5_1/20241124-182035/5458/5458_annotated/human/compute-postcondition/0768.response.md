Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. No other changes occur in the program variables.***
