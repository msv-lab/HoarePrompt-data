Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s+1`, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the modulo operation between the value in the dp list at position (i + 1) & 1, j, k and `mod`, and then added to the value in the dp list at position (i) & 1, j, k - j, also modulo `mod`.***
