Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` and `k` remain unchanged, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables or the 2D list dp.***
