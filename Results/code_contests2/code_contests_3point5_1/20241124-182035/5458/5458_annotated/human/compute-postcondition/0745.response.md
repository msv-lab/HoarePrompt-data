Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is either 0 or not 0, the value of `j` is 3, and the new value of `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. The dimensions of `dp` are `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. After this assignment, the affected part of `dp` will have a value of 1.
Output State: **`m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2` filled with zeros except for the assigned value of 1, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, and the new value of `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`**
