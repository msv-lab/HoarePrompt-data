According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2. Since `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute one more time by incrementing `k` to 3.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 2**
