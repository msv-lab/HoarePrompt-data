According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` should be within the range from 1 to `m`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`. The next value of `j` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 2**
