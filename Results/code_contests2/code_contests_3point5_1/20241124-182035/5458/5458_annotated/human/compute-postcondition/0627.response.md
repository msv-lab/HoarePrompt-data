Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive and should be incremented by 1, `mod` is an integer. If j > k, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
