Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s+1`, `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value in the `dp` list at position (i + 1) & 1, j + 1, k is updated to be the same as the value in the `dp` list at position (i + 1) & 1, j, k and the loop continues. This ensures that the program maintains the integrity of the variables and the 2D list `dp` while progressing through the loop, covering the scenario where `j` exceeds `k` and handling it appropriately.***
