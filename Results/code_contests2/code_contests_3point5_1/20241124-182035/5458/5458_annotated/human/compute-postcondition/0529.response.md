Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The state of the variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is in the range 2 to s + 1.
Output State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is in the range 2 to s + 1**
