Example Answer:
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The dimensions of dp are (2, m + 2, s + 1), so the index i + 1 & 1 is either 0 or 1. The index j + 1 ranges from 1 to m + 2, and the index k ranges from 1 to s + 1. Therefore, the Output State is: dp is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), n is greater than 0, i is either 0 or 1, j is within the range 1 to m + 1, k is the next value within the range 1 to s, s is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **dp is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), n is greater than 0, i is either 0 or 1, j is within the range 1 to m + 1, k is the next value within the range 1 to s, s is greater than or equal to 1**
