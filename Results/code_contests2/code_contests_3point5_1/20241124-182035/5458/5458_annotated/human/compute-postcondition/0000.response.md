Example Answer:
`mod` is assigned the value `100000`. This assignment does not change the initial state of variables `n`, `m`, and `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ s ≤ 3000; `mod` is 100000**.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ s ≤ 3000; `mod` is 100000**
