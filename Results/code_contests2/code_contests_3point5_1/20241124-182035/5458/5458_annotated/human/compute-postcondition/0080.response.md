Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), where after the if statement executes, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to s, `s` is at least 1. The value of `i` is 0. If j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to dp.***
