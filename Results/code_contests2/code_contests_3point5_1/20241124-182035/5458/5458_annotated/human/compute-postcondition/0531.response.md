Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is in the range 2 to s + 1. If j > k, then `dp` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dp`.***
