Example Answer:
The value at the index `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, `k` in the 2D list `dp` is assigned the value at the index `i + 1 & 1`, `j`, `k` in the `dp` list. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified in the initial state, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s+1`, `s` is at least 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s+1`, `s` is at least 1**
