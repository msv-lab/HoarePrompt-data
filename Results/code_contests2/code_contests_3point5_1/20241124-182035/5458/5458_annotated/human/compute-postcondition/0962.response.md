Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the mentioned conditions, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0, and `xrange` is valid. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the specified element in the dp array is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. In all other cases, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
