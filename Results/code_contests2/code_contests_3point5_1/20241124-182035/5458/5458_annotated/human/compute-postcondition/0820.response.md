Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2` are integers at least 1. `k + 2` is within the range of 1 to `s`. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. `i` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is assigned the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. All other variables and the structure of `dp` remain the same.***
