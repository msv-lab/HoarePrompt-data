According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` and `s` being positive integers do not guarantee the loop execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. Since `dp` is initialized with zeros, it does not affect the loop execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m, s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros**
