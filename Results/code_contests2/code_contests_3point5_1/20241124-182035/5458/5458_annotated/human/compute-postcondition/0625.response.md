Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The indices are calculated based on the current values of variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. As `&` represents the bitwise AND operation, `i + 1 & 1` will always be 0 or 1. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive and should be incremented by 1, `mod` is an integer.
Output State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive and should be incremented by 1, `mod` is an integer**
