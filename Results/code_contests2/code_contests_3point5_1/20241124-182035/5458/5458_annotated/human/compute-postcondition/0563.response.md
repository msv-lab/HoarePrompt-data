According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1)`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and mod is an integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states should be adjusted:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next value in the range 1 to `s + 1`.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1)`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and mod is an integer**
