Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1). `n` is greater than 0. `i` can be either 0 or 1. `j` is 2. `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive and is incremented by 1. `mod` is an integer. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive and is incremented by 1. If j > k, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is then incremented by the result of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
