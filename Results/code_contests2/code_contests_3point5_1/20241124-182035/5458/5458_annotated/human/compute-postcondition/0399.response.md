According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is greater than 1 ensures the loop will execute, so no adjustments are needed.
State: **`n`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` maintain their initial conditions, `m` is greater than 1**
