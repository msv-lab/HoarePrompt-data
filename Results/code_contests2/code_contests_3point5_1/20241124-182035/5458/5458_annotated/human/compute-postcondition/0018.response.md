Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m, s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value in dp at position (i + 1) & 1, (j + 1), k is set to the value in dp at position (i + 1) & 1, j, k. The program continues without altering any other variables.**
