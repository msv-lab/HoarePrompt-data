Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` remain integers with `n` and `m` at least 1, `s` at least 1. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of taking the previous value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and calculating its modulo with `mod`.**
