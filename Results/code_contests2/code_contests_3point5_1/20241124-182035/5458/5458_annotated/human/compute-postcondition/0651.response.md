Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers as per the input values. If `n`, `m`, `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there are no changes to `n`, `m`, `s`. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros, having dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2.**
