Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list that remains updated based on the conditions within the loop. `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. All other variables remain unchanged.***
