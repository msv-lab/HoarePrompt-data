Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1, `j` is 2, `k` is in the range 1 to s, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is made.
Output State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1, `j` is 2, `k` is in the range 1 to s, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is made**
