Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is in the range 2 to s + 1. If the condition j >= k is met, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. Regardless of the value of j and k, all other elements in dp remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
