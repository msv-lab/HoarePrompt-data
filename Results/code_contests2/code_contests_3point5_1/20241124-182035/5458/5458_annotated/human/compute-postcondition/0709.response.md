Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, followed by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. After the execution of the given program fragment, the `dp` list will be updated according to the described conditions, covering all possible edge cases and scenarios.***
