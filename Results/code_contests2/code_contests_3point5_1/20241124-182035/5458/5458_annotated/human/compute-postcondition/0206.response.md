Example Answer: 
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] is copied to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. The values of i, j, and k are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is adjusted based on the loop conditions, `k` is the next value after the current value.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is adjusted based on the loop conditions, `k` is the next value after the current value**
