Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. If `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is set to 1. Otherwise, when `i` is 2, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with respect to `mod`. Moreover, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is further updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with respect to `mod`. In all other cases, the elements of `dp` are not explicitly altered and retain their initial zero values.***
