Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. If j is greater than or equal to k, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is set to 1.***
