According to the code, the loop can execute if `k` is within the range from 1 to `s` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 2, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s` inclusive, and `s` is at least 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
