Example Answer:
The value at index (i + 1 & 1, j + 1, k) in the 2D list `dp` is assigned the value 1. The dimensions of `dp` are (2, m + 2, s + 1), so the updated value is at index (1, j + 1, k). The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s + 1 and the value at index (1, j + 1, k) in `dp` is 1.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s + 1 and the value at index (1, j + 1, k) in `dp` is 1**
