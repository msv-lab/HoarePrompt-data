According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the loop can execute if `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` remain integers at least 1, `i` remains either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m + 1`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `dp` remains as a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, and `k` is 1.**
