Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k = 1`, `s` are integers greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This condition holds true for all possible integer values of `i`, `j`, and `k` where `j` is greater than `k`.***
