Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, `k` is at least 3, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is determined based on the conditions. If `j` is greater than or equal to the incremented `k` value, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated through the mentioned calculations. The program handles edge cases such as `k` being incremented, ensuring the integrity of the 2D list `dp` and maintaining the relationships between variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
