According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on certain conditions, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `s` are integers**
