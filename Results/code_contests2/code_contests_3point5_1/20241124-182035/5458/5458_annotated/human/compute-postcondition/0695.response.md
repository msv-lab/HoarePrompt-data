Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The dimensions of `dp` are (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:
Output State: **n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is not 0, j is 2, k is at least 1. j is greater than k**
