Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to have the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `i` is 1, `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to have the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
