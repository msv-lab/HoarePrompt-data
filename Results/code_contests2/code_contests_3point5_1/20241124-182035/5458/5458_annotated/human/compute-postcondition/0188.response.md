Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is assigned the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, i is not equal to 0 and j is greater than k.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, i is not equal to 0 and j is greater than k**
