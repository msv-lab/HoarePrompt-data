Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the state.***
