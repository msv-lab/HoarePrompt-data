Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the value in dp at position (i + 1) & 1, (j + 1), k is updated to the value at position (i + 1) & 1, j, k. If `j` is not greater than `k`, dp at position (i + 1) & 1, (j + 1), k is calculated as the modulo of the value at position (i + 1) & 1, j, k and then incremented by the modulo of the value at position (i) & 1, j, (k - j). This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and ensures the correct state of the program after the execution of the if-else block.***
