Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` where `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration. No other variables are affected by this operation.***
