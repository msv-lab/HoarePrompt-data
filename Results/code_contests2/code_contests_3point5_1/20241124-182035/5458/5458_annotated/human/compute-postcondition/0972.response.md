The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return a string message based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, which are positive integers satisfying the constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ s ≤ 3000. The specific conditions for returning the message are not provided.
