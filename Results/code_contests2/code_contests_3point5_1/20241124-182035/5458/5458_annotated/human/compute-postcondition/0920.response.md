According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` ranging from 1 to `s + 1`. 
At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were provided:
- `n`
- `m`
- `s`
- `i`
- `j`
- `k+1` within the range of 1 to `s + 1`

To adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:
1. Update `k+1` to be within the range of 1 to `s + 1`.
2. Check the conditions:
   a. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then set `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1.
   b. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
   c. If `j <= k`, update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and increased by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` where `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`**.
