Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. In all other cases, if `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, otherwise it is updated to the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.***
