Postcondition: ***`m` and `s` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, and `k` satisfies the conditions based on the loop logic. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the program execution after the if statement, considering the initial states of the variables and the relationships between them.***
