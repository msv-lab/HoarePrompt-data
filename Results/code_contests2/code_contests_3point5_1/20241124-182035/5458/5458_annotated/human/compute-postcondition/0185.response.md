Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, i is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. All other values in the 2D list dp remain unchanged.***
