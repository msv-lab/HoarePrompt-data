According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is at least 2. Since `k` is the loop variable, it needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes properly. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `s` are already positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), and `j` is 1. To make sure the loop executes, `k` needs to be adjusted such that it starts from 1 and iterates up to `s`. Therefore, `k` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 2**
