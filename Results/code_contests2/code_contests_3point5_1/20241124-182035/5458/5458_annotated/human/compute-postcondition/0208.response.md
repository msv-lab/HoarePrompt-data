Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j`, `k` remain unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The loop continues without any changes to the variables.***
