Output State: **n is greater than 0, m and s are positive integers, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, j is 2, k is 1, s is at least 1, i is not equal to 0. If j > k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the remainder of dividing dp[i & 1][j][k - j] by mod.**
