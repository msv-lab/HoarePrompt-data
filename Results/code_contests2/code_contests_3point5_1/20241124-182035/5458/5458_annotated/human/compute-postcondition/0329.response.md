According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
