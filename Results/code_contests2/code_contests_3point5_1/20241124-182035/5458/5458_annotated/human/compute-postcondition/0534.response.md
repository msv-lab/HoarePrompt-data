Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is in the range 2 to s + 1. If i == 0 and j >= k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i == 1 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the integrity of the program state after the execution of the if else block.***
