Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1) where `m` and `s` are positive integers, `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to s inclusive, and mod is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k` in the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This covers all the possible scenarios and ensures the integrity of the program variables after the execution of the if else block.***
