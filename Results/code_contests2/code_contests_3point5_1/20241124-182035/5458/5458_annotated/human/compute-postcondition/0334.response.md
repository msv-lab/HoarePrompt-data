Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since i is 0, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 1. `j + 1` remains as it is since j is within the range 1 to m + 1. `k` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is 1, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
