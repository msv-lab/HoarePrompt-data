Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1`), `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and mod is an integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program execution continues without any changes to the other variables. This logic ensures that the state of the program remains consistent and no unexpected modifications occur.***
