According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2` ensures that the loop can execute. However, the loop index `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `m`, so the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i + 1`, `j` is 1, `k + 1`.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i + 1`, `j` is 1, `k + 1**
