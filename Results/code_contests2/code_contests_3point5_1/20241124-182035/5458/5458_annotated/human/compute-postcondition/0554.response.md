According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1`), where `m` and `s` are positive integers, `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` needs to be updated to `k + 1` to cover the next value in the range from 1 to `s` inclusive.

State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1`), `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and mod is an integer**
