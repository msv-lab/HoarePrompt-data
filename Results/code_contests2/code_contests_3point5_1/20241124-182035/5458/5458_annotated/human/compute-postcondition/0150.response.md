Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and all other variables remain the same, the output state is: *n, m, s are positive integers. dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. j is at least 2, k is at least 1, and s is at least 1. k ranges from 1 to s inclusive. i is equal to 0. j is greater than or equal to k, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1*.
