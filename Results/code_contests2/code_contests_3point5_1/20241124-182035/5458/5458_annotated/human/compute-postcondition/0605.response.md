Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, `mod` is an integer. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is strictly greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Furthermore, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the remainder of its previous value modulo `mod` and then adding the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This ensures that the program correctly handles all scenarios and updates the `dp` list accordingly.***
