Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is updated to be the same as the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`, and `s` is at least 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`, and `s` is at least 1**
