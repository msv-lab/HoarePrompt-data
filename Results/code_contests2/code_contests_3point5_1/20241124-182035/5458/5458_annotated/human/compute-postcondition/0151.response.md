Postcondition: ***n, m, s are positive integers. dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. j is at least 2, k is at least 1, and s is at least 1. k ranges from 1 to s inclusive. i is equal to 0. If j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. The program handles all possible edge cases within the given constraints.***
