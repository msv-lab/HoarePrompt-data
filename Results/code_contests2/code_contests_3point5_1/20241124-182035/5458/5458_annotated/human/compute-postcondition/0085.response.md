Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values based on the loop conditions, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to s, `s` is at least 1. i is not equal to 0. If j is greater than k, then the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program state remains unchanged for all other cases and variables.***
