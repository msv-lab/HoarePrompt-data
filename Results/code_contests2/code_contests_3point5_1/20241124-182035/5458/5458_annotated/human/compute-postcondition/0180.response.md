According to the code, the loop will execute at least once when `s` is at least 1. So, to ensure that the loop executes one more time, `s` needs to be adjusted to be at least 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2**
