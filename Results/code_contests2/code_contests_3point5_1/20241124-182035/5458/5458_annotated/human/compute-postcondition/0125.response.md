Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 1, and `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, after this calculation, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be further updated by adding the result of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment.***
