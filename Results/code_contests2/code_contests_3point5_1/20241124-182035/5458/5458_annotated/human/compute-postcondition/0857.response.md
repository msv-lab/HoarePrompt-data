Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list, `k` is less than `s + 1`, and `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated by taking the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program after the if-else block is executed.***
