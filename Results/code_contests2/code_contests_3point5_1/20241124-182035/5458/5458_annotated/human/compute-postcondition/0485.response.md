Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1). `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k + 1. If j is greater than or equal to k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, there are no changes in the variables `dp`, `n`, `i`, and `j`.***
