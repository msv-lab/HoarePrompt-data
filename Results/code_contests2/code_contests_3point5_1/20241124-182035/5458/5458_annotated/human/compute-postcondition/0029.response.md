Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with specific indices updated as follows - if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to the value at [i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and the loop continues. In all other cases, the value at [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as the sum of the values at [i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and [i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
