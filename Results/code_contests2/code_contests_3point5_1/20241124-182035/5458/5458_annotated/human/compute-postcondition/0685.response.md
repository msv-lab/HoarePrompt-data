According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is in the range from 1 to s (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is either 0 or not 0, j is 1, and k is s + 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
- n needs to remain greater than 0
- m and s should stay as integers
- dp should maintain its structure as a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2
- i can remain either 0 or not 0
- j should remain 1
- k needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range, which is k + 1

State: **n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is either 0 or not 0, j is 1, and k is s + 3**
