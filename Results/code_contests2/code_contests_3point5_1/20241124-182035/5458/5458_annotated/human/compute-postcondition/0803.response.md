Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, with `n` and `m` being at least 1, and `s` being at least 1. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After running the provided Python code snippet, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of taking the previous value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and calculating its modulo with `mod`. No other changes occur in the variables.**
