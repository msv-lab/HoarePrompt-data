According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is less than `k` and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been modified based on certain conditions. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range, i.e., `k + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `m`, `s` maintain their initial conditions. `m` is greater than 1. `j` is less than `k + 1` and `j` is greater than `k + 1`.**
