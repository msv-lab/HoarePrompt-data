Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, otherwise it is updated by adding the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
