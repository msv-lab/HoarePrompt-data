Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list that remains updated based on the conditions within the loop. `k` is less than `s` and `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, if `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Lastly, in the same scenario where `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the modulo of the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
