Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated by adding the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` after taking the modulo `mod` of it. The initial states of `dp`, `k`, and `s` remain the same. 
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list, `k` is less than `s + 1`, and `s` is greater than 0**
