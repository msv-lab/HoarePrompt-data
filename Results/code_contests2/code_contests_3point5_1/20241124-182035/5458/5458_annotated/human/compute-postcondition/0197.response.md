Example Answer: 
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly mentioned, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is at least 2, `k` is the next value after the last iteration, `s` is at least 2.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is at least 2, `k` is the next value after the last iteration, `s` is at least 2**
