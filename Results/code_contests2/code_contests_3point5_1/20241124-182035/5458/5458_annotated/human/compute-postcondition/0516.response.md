Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is in the range 1 to s. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. For all other cases where `i` is 0 or 1, and `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` or increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, depending on the conditions met.***
