Output State: **n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is either 0 or not 0, j is 1, k is s + 1, and s is greater than or equal to 1. If j is greater than k, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod. The program continues without changing other variables.**
