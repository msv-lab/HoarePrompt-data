According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 1, `k` is s. Since the loop can execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 1, `k` is less than s**
