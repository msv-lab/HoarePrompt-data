Output State: **If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` plus the modulo of the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the variables remain in their initial state.**
