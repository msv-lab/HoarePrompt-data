According to the code, the loop can execute if `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are as described and the `dp` list has been updated based on the conditions mentioned in the code. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted such that it is still within the range of 1 to `s + 1`. 

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` where `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`**
