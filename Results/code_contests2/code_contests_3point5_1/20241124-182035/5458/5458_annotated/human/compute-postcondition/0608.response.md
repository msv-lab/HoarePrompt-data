According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive, and `mod` is an integer. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1, ensuring that it is still less than or equal to `m`.
