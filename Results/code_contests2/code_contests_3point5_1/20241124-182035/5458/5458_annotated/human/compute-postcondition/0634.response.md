Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged, and the state of the other elements in the 2D list `dp` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive and is incremented by 1, `mod` is an integer.
Output State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive and is incremented by 1, `mod` is an integer**
