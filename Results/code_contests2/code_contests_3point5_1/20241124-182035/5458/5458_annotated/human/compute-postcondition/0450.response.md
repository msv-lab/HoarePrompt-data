Example Answer:
The value of dp at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Based on the initial state, this means that the value at index `[1][2][2]` will be set to 1. The rest of the variables remain the same.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][2][2]` is 1**
