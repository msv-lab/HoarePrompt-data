Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is set to 1. If `i` is 2 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
