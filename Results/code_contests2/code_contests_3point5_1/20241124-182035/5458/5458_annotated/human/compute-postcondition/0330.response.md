According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that `j` is within that range. Since `m` is not defined in the initial state, we need to consider that `m` is greater than 0. Additionally, `n` being greater than 0 and `i` being 0 are already in the correct state for the loop to execute.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1**
