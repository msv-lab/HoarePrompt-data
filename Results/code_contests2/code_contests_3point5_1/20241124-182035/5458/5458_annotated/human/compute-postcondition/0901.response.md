Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The indices are calculated based on the previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, but their specific values are not given. Therefore, the output state is: `n, m, s, i, j, k` are integers, where `n`, `m`, and `s` are at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` remains as a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`n, m, s, i, j, k` are integers, where `n`, `m`, and `s` are at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` remains as a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
