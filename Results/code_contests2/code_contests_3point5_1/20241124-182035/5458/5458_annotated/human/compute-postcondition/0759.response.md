According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive). Given that `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, and `s` is an integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`.
