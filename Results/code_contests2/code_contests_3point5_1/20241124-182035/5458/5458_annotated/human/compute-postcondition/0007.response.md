According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j is within the range of 1 to m inclusive. Before the loop starts, n is greater than 0 ensures the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. Since dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, it is already set correctly. To ensure the loop executes, j needs to be set to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m, s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 1**
