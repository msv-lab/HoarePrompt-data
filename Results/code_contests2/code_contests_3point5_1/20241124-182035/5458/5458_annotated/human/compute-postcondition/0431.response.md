Output State: **If i is equal to 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is not equal to 0 and j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. If j is not greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. If s is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the variables maintain their initial values.**
