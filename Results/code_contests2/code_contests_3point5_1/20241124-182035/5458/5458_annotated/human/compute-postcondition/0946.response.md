Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Since `i` can be either 0 or 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 2, the new values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions mentioned, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, `xrange` is valid.
Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions mentioned, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, `xrange` is valid**
