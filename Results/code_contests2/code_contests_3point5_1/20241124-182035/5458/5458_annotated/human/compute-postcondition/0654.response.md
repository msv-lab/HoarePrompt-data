According to the code, the loop can execute if s is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, n is greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to s is greater than or equal to 1, k is 1. 
State: **n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is 0, j is 1, k is 1, s is greater than or equal to 1**
