According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is at least 3. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is determined based on the conditions mentioned. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than `s + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, `k` is at least 3, and `k` is less than `s + 1**.
