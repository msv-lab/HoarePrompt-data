Output State: 
- `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values based on the loop conditions.
- `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1.
- If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1.
- In all other cases, dp is updated based on the conditions within the loop.
- If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` > `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].
- dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is then updated by summing the remainder of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] divided by mod.
- The loop will not execute if s is 0, in which case dp will remain with initial values of zeros.
