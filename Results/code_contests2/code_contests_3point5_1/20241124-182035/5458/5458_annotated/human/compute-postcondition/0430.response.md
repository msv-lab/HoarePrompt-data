According to the code provided, the next iteration of the loop depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `dp`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `m`, `s` maintain their initial conditions. `m` is greater than 1. `j` is less than `k + 1` and `j` is greater than `k + 1`. After the if statement executes, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 or `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. In the else part, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be modified:
- `k` needs to be updated to the next value in the range, so `k + 1`
- `s` remains the same
- `i` remains the same
- `j` needs to be incremented based on the conditions given
- `dp` values need to be updated based on the conditions given for the `if` and `else` statements

State: **`n`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `m`, `s` maintain their initial conditions, `dp` values are updated based on the conditions**
