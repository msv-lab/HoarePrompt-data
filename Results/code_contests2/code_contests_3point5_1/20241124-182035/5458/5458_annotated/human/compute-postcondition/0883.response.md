Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers meeting the specified conditions. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. If `j > k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is assigned the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` in `dp`, and the loop continues. After executing the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, ensuring the integrity of the variables and the 2D list `dp` is maintained.**
