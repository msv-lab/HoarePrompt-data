According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 2. Since the loop has already executed up to `k = s`, for it to execute one more time, the value of `k` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 2 and now `k` is incremented by 1**.
