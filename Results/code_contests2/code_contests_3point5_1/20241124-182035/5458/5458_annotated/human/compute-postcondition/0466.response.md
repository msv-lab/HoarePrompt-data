Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. After the execution of the if statement, if i == 0 and j >= k, the element at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] in dp is set to 1. If i == 1 and j > k, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, in the else part of the inner if statement when i == 1 and j <= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the sum of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. The postcondition ensures that the program variables maintain their initial conditions and correctly handle all possible edge cases within the specified constraints.***
