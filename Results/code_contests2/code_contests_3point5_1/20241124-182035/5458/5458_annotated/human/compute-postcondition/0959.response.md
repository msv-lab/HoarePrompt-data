Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the mentioned conditions, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0, and `xrange` is valid. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. All other variables retain their initial values and relationships***
