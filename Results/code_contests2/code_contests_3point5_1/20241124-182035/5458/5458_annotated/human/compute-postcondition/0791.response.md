Output State: 
- `n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`.
- If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
- Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

**Note:** The loop will not execute if `s` is less than 1. In such a case, the `dp` array will remain as a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, and all other variables will retain their initial values.
