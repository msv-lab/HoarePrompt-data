Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with specific indices updated as described; `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s+1)`; the specific indices of dp are updated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
