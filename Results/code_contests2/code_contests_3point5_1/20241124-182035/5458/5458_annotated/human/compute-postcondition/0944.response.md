Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is m + 1, `dp` is updated based on the conditions mentioned, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `xrange` is valid. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is 2 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` when divided by `mod`. Additionally, in the case where `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This encompasses all possibilities and edge cases for the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and `xrange` as outlined in the precondition.***
