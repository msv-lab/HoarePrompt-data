According to the code, the loop will execute if n is at least 1. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were met:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` and `s` are integers
- `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`
- `i` is either 0 or not 0
- `j` is at least 1
- `k` is at least 1

Based on the provided conditions, the following states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration:
- `i + 1`
- `j + 1`
- `k`

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i + 1`, `j + 1`, `k + 1**
