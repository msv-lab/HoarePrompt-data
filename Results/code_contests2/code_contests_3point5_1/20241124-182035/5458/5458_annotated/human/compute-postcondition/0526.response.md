According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `k` is in the range 1 to s + 1. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is in the range 1 to s + 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range 1 to s + 1.

State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is in the range 2 to s + 1**
