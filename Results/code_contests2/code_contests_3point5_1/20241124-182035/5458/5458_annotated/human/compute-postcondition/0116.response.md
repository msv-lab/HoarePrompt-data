Example Answer:
The value of dp at position [i + 1][j + 1][k] is updated to 1. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, s are positive integers, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, j is at least 1, k is at least 1, s is at least 1, i is equal to 0, and j is greater than or equal to k.
Output State: **n, m, s are positive integers, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, j is at least 1, k is at least 1, s is at least 1, i is equal to 0, and j is greater than or equal to k**
