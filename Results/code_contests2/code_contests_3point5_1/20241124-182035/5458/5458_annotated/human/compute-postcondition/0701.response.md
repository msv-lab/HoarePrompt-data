According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `k` is currently at the end of the loop range, we need to increment `k` by 1.
- All other variables and lists retain their initial values.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 2**
