Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions mentioned, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, `xrange` is valid.
Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions mentioned, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, `xrange` is valid**
