Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1)`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and `mod` is an integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` is updated where `i` toggles to the opposite value, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` remains the same. The postcondition ensures that the program maintains the initial state and appropriately updates the variables based on the given conditions, covering all possible edge cases.***
