According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `s` are integers. The conditions for the loop to execute one more time are that `k + 1` should be less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k + 1`.
State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `s` are integers**
