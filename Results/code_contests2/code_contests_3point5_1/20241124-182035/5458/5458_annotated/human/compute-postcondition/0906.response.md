Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` remain integers at least 1, `i` remains 2, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m + 1`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `dp` remains as a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
