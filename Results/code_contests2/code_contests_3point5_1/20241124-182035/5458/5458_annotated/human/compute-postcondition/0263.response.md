Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned a new value based on the previous states.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned a new value based on the previous states**
