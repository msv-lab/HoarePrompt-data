Example Answer:
The value in the dynamic programming array `dp` at indices `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, `k` is updated by adding the value at indices `i & 1`, `j`, `k - j` modulo `mod`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1`, and the dynamic programming array `dp` have been updated as described above.**
