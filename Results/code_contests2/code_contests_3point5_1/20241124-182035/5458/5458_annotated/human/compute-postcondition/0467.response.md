According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `k` is currently 3, it needs to be incremented to continue within the range of 1 to `s + 1`.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 4, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
