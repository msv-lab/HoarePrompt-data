Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[1][3][1] is assigned 1. All other values in dp remain unchanged.***
