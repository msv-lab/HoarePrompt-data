Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, `mod` is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If `j` is not greater than `k` in the else part, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the modulo of the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] with `mod`, and then it is incremented by the modulo of the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j] with `mod`. This covers all possible cases and edge scenarios of the program execution.***
