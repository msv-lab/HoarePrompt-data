Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The state of the other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 2, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s inclusive, and `s` is at least 1.
