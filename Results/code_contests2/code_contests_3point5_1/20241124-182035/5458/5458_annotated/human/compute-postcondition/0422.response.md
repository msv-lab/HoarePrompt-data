Example Answer: 
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since the previous values of variables are not provided, the output state is: `n`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `m`, `s` maintain their initial conditions. `m` is greater than 1. `j` is less than `k + 1` and `j` is greater than `k + 1`. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1.
Output State: **`n`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `m`, `s` maintain their initial conditions. `m` is greater than 1. `j` is less than `k + 1` and `j` is greater than `k + 1`. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1**
