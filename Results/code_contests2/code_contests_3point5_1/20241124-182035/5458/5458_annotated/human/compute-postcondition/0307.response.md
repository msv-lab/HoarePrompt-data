Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases, including when `i` is not 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
