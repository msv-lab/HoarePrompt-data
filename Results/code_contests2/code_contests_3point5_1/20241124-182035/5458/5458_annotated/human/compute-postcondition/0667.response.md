According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is less than or equal to s. At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is either 0 or not 0, j is 1, k is s, and s is greater than or equal to 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of k needs to be adjusted. Since k is currently equal to s, it needs to be incremented by 1 to satisfy the loop condition k < s. 

State: **n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is either 0 or not 0, j is 1, k is s + 1, and s is greater than or equal to 1**
