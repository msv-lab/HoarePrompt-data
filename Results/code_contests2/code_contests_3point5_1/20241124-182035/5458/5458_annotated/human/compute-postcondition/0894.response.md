Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `n` and `m` remain as integers at least 1, `s` stays as an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, and `dp` remains as a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is set to 1. If `i` is 2 and `j > k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All other program variables and arrays maintain their integrity for the next iteration of the loop, encompassing all edge cases.***
