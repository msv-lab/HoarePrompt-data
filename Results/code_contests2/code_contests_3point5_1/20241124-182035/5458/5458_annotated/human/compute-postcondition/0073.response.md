According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s+1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s+2`**
