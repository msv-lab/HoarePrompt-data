According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` are provided. 

To adjust the state for the next iteration:
1. Update `k+1` to the next value within the range of 1 to `s + 1`.
2. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1.
3. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
4. Update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` adjusted accordingly based on the above criteria**.
