Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This means that the value at index `j` in the row `i + 1` is assigned the value at index `j` in the row `i`, for the same column `k`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and the state of the 2D list `dp` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is at least 2, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s inclusive, and `s` is at least 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is at least 2, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s inclusive, and `s` is at least 1**
