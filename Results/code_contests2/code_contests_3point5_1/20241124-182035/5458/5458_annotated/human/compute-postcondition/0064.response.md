According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` in the range from 1 to `s` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s`, `s` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted to `k` is equal to `s+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s+1`, `s` is at least 1**
