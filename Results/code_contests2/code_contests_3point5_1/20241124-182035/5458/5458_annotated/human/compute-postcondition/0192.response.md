Example Answer:
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated as described**
