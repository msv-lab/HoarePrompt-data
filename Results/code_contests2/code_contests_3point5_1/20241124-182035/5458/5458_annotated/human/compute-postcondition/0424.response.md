Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The current values of the variables do not change, so the output state is: `n`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `m`, `s` maintain their initial conditions. `m` is greater than 1, `j` is less than `k + 1` and `j` is greater than `k + 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `m`, `s` maintain their initial conditions. `m` is greater than 1, `j` is less than `k + 1` and `j` is greater than `k + 1`**
