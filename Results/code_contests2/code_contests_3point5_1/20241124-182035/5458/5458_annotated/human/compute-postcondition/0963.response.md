According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the mentioned conditions, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0, and `xrange` is valid.

To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value within the range. Therefore, `k` should be set to its current value plus 1.
State: **`i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the mentioned conditions, `k` is 4, `s` is greater than 0, and `xrange` is valid**.
