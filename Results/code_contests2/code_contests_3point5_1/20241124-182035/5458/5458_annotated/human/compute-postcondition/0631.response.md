According to the code provided, the loop can execute again if the value of `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1). `n` is greater than 0. `i` can be either 0 or 1. `j` is 2. `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive and is incremented by 1. `mod` is an integer.**
