Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` is updated, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `xrange` is valid. After the execution of the if statement, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. This holds true for all possible combinations and edge cases of the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and `xrange` as described in the precondition.***
