According to the code, the loop can execute again if `s > 0` and `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is less than or equal to 0. Since `s` being less than or equal to 0 means the loop won't execute, `s` needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: If `s` is greater than 0, `i` will either be 0 or 2, `j` will be `m + 1`, and `k` will range from 1 to `s`. The `dp` array will be updated as specified in the loop code.**
