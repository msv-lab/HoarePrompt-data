According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range from 1 to s + 1. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s + 1. 

To adjust for the next iteration of the loop:
1. If `k` is less than s + 1, then `k` should be incremented by 1.
2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 2 to s + 1**
