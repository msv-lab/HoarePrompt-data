Postcondition: ***`m` and `s` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, and the new value of `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. If `i` equals 0, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 when `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of the current value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the modulo of the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the correct state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block.***
