Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 2, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s inclusive, and `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater or equal to `k`, then the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is computed as the modulo of the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and this value is then incremented by the modulo of the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. All variables retain their positive integer values, and the updated values in the list dp reflect the respective conditions based on the comparisons between `j` and `k` in each case.***
