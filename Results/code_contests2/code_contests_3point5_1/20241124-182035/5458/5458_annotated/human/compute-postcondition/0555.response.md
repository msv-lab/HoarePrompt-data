Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to calculate the new index values. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1`), `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and mod is an integer, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1`), `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, mod is an integer, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
