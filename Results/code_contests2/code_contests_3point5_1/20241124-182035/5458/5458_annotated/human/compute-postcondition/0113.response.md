According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `dp` being positive integers with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) and updated values, `j` being at least 1, and `k` being at least 1 are already in place. Therefore, the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 1, and `s` is at least 1**
