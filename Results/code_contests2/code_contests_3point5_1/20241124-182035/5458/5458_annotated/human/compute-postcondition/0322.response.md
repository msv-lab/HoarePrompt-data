Output State: 
- `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; 1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ s ≤ 3000; mod is 100000.
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values based on the loop conditions.
- `i`, `j`, `k` are at least 1.
- If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains with initial values of zeros.
- When `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
- In all other cases:
  - If `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
  - If `j <= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.
  - Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.
