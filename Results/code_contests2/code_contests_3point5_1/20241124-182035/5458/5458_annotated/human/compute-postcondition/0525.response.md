Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is in the range 1 to s + 1. If i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then dp is updated such that dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is 1 and j > k, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. All other elements of `dp` remain unchanged.***
