Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The value of `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and all variables are integers greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is 0, the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 1. Therefore, the new state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`dp[1][j + 1][k] = 1`, where `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and all variables are integers greater than or equal to 1**
