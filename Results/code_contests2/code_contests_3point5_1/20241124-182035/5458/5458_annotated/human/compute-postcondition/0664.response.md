Output State: **n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is not equal to 0, j is 1, k is 1, s is greater than or equal to 1. If j is greater than k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.**
