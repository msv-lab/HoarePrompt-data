Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1` are integers at least 1. `k + 1` is within the range of 1 to `s`. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. `i` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k + 1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is updated to be the result of taking the previous value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k + 1]` and calculating its modulo with `mod`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
