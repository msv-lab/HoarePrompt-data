Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, m and s are integers. dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is either 0 or not 0, j is 1, and k is s + 1 where s is greater than or equal to 1. If i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1, leaving the rest of dp unchanged. If i is not 0 and j is greater than k, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If j is not greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is computed as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod and then incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. The program continues without altering other variables.***
