Output State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the element at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to be the same as the element at position `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and all other elements in `dp` and variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `k` retain their original values.**
