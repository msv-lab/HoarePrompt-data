According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its range from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range (k + 1). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k + 1**
