Output State: **`m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, `k` satisfies the conditions based on the loop logic described above. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. In all other cases where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no change in the values of the variables and the list remains the same as before executing the if statement.**
