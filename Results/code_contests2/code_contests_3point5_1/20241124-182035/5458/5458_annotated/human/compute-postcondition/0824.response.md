According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2` are integers at least 1, and `k + 2` is within the range of 1 to `s`. The state of `dp` is also specified. Since the loop should execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted for the next iteration.
State: *`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 3` are integers at least 1. `k + 3` is within the range of 1 to `s`. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is 1.
