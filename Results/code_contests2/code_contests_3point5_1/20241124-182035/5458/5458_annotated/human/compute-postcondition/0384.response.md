Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), n is greater than 0, i is either 0 or 1, j is within the range 1 to m + 1, k is the next value within the range 1 to s, and s is greater than or equal to 1. If j > k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. In all other cases, the state of the program remains unchanged.**
