According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `s` remain integers at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, and `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be updated, and other variables should remain the same as described above. Therefore, the next state after the loop executes one more time is:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` remain integers at least 1, `i` remains either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m + 1`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, and `dp` remains as a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`**
