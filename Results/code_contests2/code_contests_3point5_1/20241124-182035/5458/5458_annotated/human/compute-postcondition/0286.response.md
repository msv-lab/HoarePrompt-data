According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the initial state needs to be adjusted such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are all integers with `s` being greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is set to 1 initially.
State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]`, `i`, `j`, `k = 1`, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1**
