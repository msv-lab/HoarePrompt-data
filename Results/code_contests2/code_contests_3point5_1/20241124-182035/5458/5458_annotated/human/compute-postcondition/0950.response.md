Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions mentioned, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, `xrange` is valid. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. All other variables retain their initial values and relationships.***
