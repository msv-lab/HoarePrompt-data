Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers with `n` and `m` at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is strictly greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is equal to or less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
