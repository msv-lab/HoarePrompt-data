Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k = 2`, `s`, mod are integers greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. In all other cases where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program continues without any changes.**
