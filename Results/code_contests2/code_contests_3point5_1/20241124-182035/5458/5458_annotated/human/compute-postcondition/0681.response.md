Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0. m and s are integers. dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2. i is either 0 or not 0. j is 1, and k is s + 2 where s is greater than or equal to 1. If j > k, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to be equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. In all other cases, there is no change in the state of the program variables after the if else block executes.***
