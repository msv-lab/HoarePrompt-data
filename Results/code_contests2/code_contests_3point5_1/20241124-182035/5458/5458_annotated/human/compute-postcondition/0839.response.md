Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list that remains updated based on the conditions within the loop, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. In all other cases, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the sum of the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
