According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers with `n` and `m` at least 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range of `1` to `s`, which means incrementing `k` by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are integers with `n` and `m` at least 1, `k` is the next value in the range of `1` to `s`**
