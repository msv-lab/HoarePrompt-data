Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input. Since the values are positive integers within the specified ranges, the variables are updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers; 1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ s ≤ 3000; `mod` is 100000**
