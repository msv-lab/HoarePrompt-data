Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will have the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
