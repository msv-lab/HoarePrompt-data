Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables i, j, and k have specific values, so after execution, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is either 0 or not 0, j is 1, k is s + 1, and s is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is either 0 or not 0, j is 1, k is s + 1, and s is greater than or equal to 1**.
