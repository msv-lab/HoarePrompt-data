Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the mentioned conditions, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, and `xrange` is valid. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the element at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is set to 1. If `i` is 2 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, in the else part when `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
