Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers with `n` and `m` at least 1. `i` is incremented by 1. `j` is set to 1. `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to `s`. After the execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
