Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive, `mod` is an integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, no change occurs in the values of the variables.***
