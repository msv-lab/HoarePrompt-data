Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is at least 2, `k` is the next value after the last iteration, `s` is at least 2. If j > k, the values in dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] remain the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the program continues execution without any changes to the other variables.***
