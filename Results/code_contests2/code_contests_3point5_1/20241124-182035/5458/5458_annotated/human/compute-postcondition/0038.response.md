Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1). If i == 0 and j >= k, then the specific index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is updated to 1 where `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s+1)`. If i > 0 and j > k, then the specific index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If i > 0 and j <= k, the specific index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then added with the value of `[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All other indices in the `dp` list remain unchanged.***
