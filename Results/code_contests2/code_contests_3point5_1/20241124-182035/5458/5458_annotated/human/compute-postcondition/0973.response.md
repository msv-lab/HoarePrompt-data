Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input consisting of positive integers n, m, and s, calculates certain values using dynamic programming, and prints a result. However, the specific conditions for returning a message based on n, m, and s are not clearly defined in the code. The function seems to be related to solving a dynamic programming problem efficiently.**
