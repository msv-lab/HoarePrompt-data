Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1. After the execution of the if-else block, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is determined based on the conditions. If `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] after applying the modulo operation. If `j` is not greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod plus dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
