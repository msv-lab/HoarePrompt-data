Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1)` where `m` and `s` are positive integers, `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and `mod` is an integer. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. The update only occurs if all the initial conditions are met, and it ensures that the specific cell in the 2D list `dp` is set to 1 based on the given indices and conditions.***
