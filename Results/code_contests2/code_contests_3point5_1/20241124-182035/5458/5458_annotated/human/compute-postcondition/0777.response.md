Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The loop continues iteratively while maintaining the described state.***
