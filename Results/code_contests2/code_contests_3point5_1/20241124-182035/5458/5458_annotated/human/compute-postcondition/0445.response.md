Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will have the same value as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, there are no changes in the state of the variables.***
