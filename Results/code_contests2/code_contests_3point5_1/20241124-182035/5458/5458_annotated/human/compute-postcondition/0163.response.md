Example Answer: 
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Since the i-th row (i+1 & 1) is dependent on the values of the (i-1)th row (i & 1), this assignment essentially copies the value from the previous column at the same row and height to the current column. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 2, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s inclusive, and `s` is at least 1.
