Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1). If `j` is larger than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, when `j >= k` and `i = 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. If `j > k` and `i = 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. For all other cases, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` where `k` is incremented by 1 after the execution of the if statement.**
