Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1) where if j >= k, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. The variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` maintain their initial conditions. All edge cases regarding the ranges and values of `j` and `k` are accounted for, ensuring the integrity of the program state.***
