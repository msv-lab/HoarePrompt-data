Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
