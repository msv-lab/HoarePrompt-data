According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers greater than or equal to 1. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to continue the loop.
- All other states remain the same as their values are independent of the loop variable `k`.

State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `s` are integers greater than or equal to 1**
