Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1, but their initial values are not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to `s`, and `dp` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to `s`, and `dp` is updated accordingly**
