Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The indices `i + 1 & 1` represent either 0 or 1 based on the value of `i`. The value of `j + 1` is 2. The value of `k` remains unchanged, but it ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, `mod` is an integer, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, `mod` is an integer, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
