According to the given code, the loop condition depends on the variables `j` and `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. Based on the loop conditions, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than or equal to `m`. 

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `j`. It should be updated to ensure that the loop can execute again.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is adjusted accordingly based on loop conditions**
