Postcondition: ***`m` and `s` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, `k` is adjusted based on the loop logic. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This covers all potential cases and summarizes the program state after the execution of the if else block.***
