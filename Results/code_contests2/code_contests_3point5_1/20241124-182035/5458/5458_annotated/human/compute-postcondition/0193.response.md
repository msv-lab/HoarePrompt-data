Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2. If i is equal to 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is not equal to 0 and j is greater than k, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the remainder of the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] divided by mod. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the remainder of the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j] divided by mod. All other variables remain in their initial state.***
