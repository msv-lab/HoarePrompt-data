According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `m + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **After the loop executes, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m + 1**.
