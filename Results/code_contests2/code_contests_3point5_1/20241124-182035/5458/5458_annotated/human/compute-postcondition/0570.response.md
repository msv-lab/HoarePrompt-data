Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not directly impacted by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1`), `n` is greater than 0, `i` toggles to the opposite value, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and `mod` is an integer.
Output State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1`), `n` is greater than 0, `i` toggles to the opposite value, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and `mod` is an integer.**
