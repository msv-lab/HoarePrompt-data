Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s + 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at index (1, j + 1, k) in `dp` is set to 1. All other elements in `dp` remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement, maintaining the initial conditions of the variables.***
