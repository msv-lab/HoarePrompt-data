Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] after applying the modulo operation.**
