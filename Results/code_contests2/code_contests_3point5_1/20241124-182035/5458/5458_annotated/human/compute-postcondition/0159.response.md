Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, and `s` is at least 1. `k` ranges from 1 to s inclusive. When `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. In all other cases where `i` is not 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] becomes the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If `j` is not greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the remainder of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] divided by `mod`, and then it is increased by the remainder of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] divided by `mod`. This postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if else block.***
