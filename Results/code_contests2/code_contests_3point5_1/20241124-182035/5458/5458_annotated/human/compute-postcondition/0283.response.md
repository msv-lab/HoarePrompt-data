According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `s` are integers. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted by incrementing it by 1.
State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 2]`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `s` are integers**
