Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i can only be 0 or 1, i + 1 & 1 will always result in the opposite value of i. The values of j and k remain the same as 2 and in the range 1 to s + 1 respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: dp remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), n is greater than 0, i is either 0 or 1, j is 2, k is in the range 1 to s + 1, and dp has been updated according to the given assignment.
Output State: **dp remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), n is greater than 0, i is either 0 or 1, j is 2, k is in the range 1 to s + 1, and dp has been updated according to the given assignment**
