Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases, including when `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. `i`, `j`, `k` are 2, and `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.***
