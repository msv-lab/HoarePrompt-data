Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1)` where `m` and `s` are positive integers, `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is either 1 or 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and `mod` is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is strictly greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with respect to `mod`. In all other cases, the values of `dp` are unaltered.***
