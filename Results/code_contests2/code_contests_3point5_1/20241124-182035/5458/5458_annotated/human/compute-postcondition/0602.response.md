Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, `mod` is an integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program continues execution without any changes to the state.***
