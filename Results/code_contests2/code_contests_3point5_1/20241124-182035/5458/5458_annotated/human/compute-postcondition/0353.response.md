According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is within the range from 1 to s. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, and `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s. 

To execute one more time, the next value of `k` needs to be considered. Since `k` is within the range from 1 to s, the next value of `k` should be within the same range. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to be the next value in the range from 1 to s.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s + 1**
