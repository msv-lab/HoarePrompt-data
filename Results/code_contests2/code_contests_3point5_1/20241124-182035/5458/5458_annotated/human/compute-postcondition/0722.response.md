According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` and `s` being integers and `dp` being a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2` ensures that the loop will execute. However, `i` being either 0 or not 0, `j` being 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` being updated according to the loop logic need to be adjusted. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, `k` is adjusted based on the loop logic, `dp[i][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the loop logic**
