According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` was greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n`. The loop also depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` meeting certain conditions. At the end of the last iteration, the loop had calculated values in a 2D list `dp` with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1). The loop will execute one more time if the loop index `i` has not reached `n ** 2 - 1`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **The loop index `i` is less than `n ** 2 - 1`, dimensions of `dp` are (2, m + 2, s + 1)**
