Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1). `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k + 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In the else part, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod` and then incremented by the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
