Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned, so the current state is not impacted by their values. The dimensions of `dp` are updated based on `(m+2) x (s+1)`, and the value 1 is assigned to the specific index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`, and `s` is at least 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`, and `s` is at least 1**
