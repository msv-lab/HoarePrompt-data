According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range 1 to s. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `k` value needs to be adjusted to the next value within the range 1 to s. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value within the range 1 to s, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
