Output State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1. If j is greater than k, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. After executing the code snippet, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the remainder of the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] divided by `mod`.**
