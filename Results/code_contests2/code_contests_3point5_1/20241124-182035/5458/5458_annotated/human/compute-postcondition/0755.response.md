According to the provided conditions and loop statement:
- The loop will execute `s` times, so we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least one more time.
- At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions need to be met for the loop to execute one more time:
    - If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. 
    - If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 
    - If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
    - If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and the values of the variables will remain the same as the initial state.

State: **The state at the end of the previous iteration remains the same if the loop does not execute one more time, as the condition for the loop to execute one more time is not clearly defined based on the provided information.**
