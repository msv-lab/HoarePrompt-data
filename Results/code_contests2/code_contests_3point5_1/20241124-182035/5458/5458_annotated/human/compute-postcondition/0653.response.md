According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j is within the range of 1 to m inclusive. Before the loop starts, n is greater than 0 ensures that the loop will execute, m and s are already defined as integers, dp is initialized with zeros, and i is 0. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, you need to set j to 1.
State: **n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is 0, j is 1**
