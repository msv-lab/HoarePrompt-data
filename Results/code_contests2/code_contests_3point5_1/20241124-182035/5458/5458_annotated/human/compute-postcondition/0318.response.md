Output State: **After the loop executes, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and summarizes the final state of the program after the loop execution. If `s` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute, and all variables will retain their initial values.**
