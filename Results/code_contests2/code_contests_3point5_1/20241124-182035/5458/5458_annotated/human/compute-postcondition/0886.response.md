According to the code, the loop can execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, and `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
- If `i` is 0, then the value at index `[1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` must be set to 1, where `j` is within the range of 1 to `m` and `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`.
- If `i` is 2, then the value at index `[1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` must be updated based on the described conditions.

No other states need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, and `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`.
