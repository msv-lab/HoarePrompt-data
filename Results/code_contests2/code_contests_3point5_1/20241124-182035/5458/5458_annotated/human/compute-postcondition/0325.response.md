Example Answer:
The variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` depend on the input given during execution. The loop does not affect the state. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `dp[n` is dependent on the input values, `n, m, s` are assigned input values.
Output State: **The value of `dp[n` is dependent on the input values, `n, m, s` are assigned input values**
