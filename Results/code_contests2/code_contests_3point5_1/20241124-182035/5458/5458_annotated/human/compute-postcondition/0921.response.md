Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` where `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` where `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
