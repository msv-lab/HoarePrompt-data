Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1). If `j >= k`, then the specific index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is updated to 1, where `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s+1)`. The program state remains unchanged for all other indices in the `dp` list.***
