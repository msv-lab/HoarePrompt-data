Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`, and `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. In both cases, the program ensures the proper update of the 2D list based on the given conditions, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
