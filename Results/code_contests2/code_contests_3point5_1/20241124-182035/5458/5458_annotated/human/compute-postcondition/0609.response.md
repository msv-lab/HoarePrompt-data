According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. The loop will execute if `s` is greater than or equal to 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `j` by 1, making sure it is still less than or equal to `m`.

State: *`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive, `mod` is an integer*
