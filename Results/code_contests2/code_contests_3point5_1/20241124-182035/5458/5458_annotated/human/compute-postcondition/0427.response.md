Output State: **`n`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `m`, `s` maintain their initial conditions. `m` is greater than 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then no assignment is made and the loop continues. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
