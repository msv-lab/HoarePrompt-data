Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1). `j` remains unchanged. `k` is the next value in the range (1, s + 1). If `j` is greater than `k`, then the element at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program continues without any changes.**
