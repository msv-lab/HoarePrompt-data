Since the `while` loop condition is `1` which is equivalent to `True`, the loop will continue indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of within the loop body. Therefore, the state after the previous iteration can simply be repeated without any adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **The values of the variables and the 2D list `dp` are maintained as described above. The output value is the result of `dp[n]`.**
