Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
