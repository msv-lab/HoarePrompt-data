Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is in the range 1 to s. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. This assignment holds true for all possible combinations of `j` and `k` within their specified ranges.***
