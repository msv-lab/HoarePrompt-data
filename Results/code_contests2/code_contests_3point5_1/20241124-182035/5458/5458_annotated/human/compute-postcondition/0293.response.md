Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k = 1`, `s` are integers greater than or equal to 1. j is greater than k.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k = 1`, `s` are integers greater than or equal to 1. j is greater than k**
