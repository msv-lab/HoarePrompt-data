Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 2 and `k` is the next value after the last iteration. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `k` remains the same, `s` is at least 2, and the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Furthermore, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
