According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is at least 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `j` is currently 1 and needs to be less than or equal to `m`, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **Output State: `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is at least 1**
