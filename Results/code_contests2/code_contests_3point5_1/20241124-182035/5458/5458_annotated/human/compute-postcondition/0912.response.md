Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` where `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` where `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
