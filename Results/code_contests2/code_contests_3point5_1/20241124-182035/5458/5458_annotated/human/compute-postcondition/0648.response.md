Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values based on the input from `raw_input().split()`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are maintained as provided in the initial state. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are as per input values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are as per input values**
