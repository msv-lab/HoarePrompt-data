Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1). `n` is greater than 0. `i` can be either 0 or 1. `j` is 2. `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive and should be incremented by 1. `mod` is an integer. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
