According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, and the new value of `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted such that it is within the range of 1 to `s` and it is different from the last value of `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, and the new value of `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` and different from the last value of `k`**
