Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1). `j` remains unchanged. `k` is the next value in the range (1, s + 1). If i == 0 and j >= k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If i > 0 and j > k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` added to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This summarizes all possible scenarios and edge cases after the execution of the if else block.***
