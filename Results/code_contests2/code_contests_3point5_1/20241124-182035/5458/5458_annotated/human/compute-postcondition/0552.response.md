Output State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 1, `j` remains 1, `k` ranges from 1 to s inclusive, `s` remains greater than 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program continues without any changes to the initial state.**
