Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1). The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged. After the if-else block executes, the following conditions hold:
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the modulo of the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the modulo of the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. This covers all possible cases and edge conditions of the program after the if-else block executes.***
