Output State: **If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the previous value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, after the execution of the if-else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of the previous value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, then incremented by the remainder of the division between `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod. If `i` is non-zero and `j` is not greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the division between `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of the division between `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`. If `s` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and the initial state is maintained.**
