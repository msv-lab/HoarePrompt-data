According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` does not provide enough information to determine if the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0, `i` is the previous value of `i + 1 & 1`, `j` is the previous value of `j + 1`, and `k` is now 1.
State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `i` is the previous value of `i + 1 & 1`, `j` is the previous value of `j + 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0**
