According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 2. All other states need to remain the same.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer, `i` is 2, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`**
