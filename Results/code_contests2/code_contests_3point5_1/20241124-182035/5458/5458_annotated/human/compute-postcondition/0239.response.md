Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the previous value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If `j` is not greater than `k` in the else part, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as the modulo of the previous value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the sum of the previous value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo `mod`. The program execution ensures the integrity of the variables and data structures throughout the if else block, considering all possible edge cases.***
