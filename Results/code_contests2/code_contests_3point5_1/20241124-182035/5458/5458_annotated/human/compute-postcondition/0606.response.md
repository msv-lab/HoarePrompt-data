According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and `mod` is an integer. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `k` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range from 1 to `s + 1`.
- Since `k` is being iterated over, the value of `k` needs to be increased by 1.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive and has been incremented by 1, `mod` is an integer**
