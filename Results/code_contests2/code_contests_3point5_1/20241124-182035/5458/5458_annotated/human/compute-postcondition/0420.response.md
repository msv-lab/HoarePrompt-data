Postcondition: ***`n`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `s` maintain their initial conditions. `m` is greater than 1. `j` is less than `k` and `j` is greater than `k`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0`, and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
