Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers meeting the specified conditions. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. If `j > k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is assigned the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` in `dp`, and the loop continues. This ensures that the program maintains the integrity of the variables and the 2D list `dp` after the execution of the if statement, accounting for all possible edge cases within the given constraints.***
