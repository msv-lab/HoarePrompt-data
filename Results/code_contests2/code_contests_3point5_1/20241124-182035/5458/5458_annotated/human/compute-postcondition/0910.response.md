Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers where `n`, `m`, and `s` are at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m + 1`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `dp` remains as a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is set to 1. If `i` is 2 and `j > k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is updated based on the previous values in the list with proper modulo operations considered for each step. All other variables and their relationships remain intact throughout the execution of the program fragment.***
