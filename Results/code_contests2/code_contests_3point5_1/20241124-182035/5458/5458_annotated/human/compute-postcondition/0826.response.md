According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is the maximum value for `j`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to `m + 1`.
State: **No adjustments needed as the loop has not executed yet, `dp` 2D list remains updated based on the conditions within the loop.**
