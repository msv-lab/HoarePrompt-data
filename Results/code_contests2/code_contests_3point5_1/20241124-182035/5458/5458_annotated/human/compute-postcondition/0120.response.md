Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 1, and `s` is at least 1. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
