Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned, so their previous values remain unchanged. Since the assignment is made to the other index of `dp`, the state of `dp` is updated while other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1) where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value within the range 1 to s, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
