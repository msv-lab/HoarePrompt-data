According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the value of k is less than or equal to s. At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is either 0 or not 0, j is 1, and k is s + 1 where s is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of k needs to be adjusted such that k is incremented by 1. 
State: **n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is either 0 or not 0, j is 1, and k is s + 2 where s is greater than or equal to 1**
