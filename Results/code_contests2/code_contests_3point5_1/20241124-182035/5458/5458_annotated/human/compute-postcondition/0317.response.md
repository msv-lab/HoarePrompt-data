According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables (`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `s`) are integers greater than or equal to 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Increment `k` by 1
- Reset the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` according to the conditions mentioned in the postcondition described for the if-else block
- Ensure that `k` is still less than or equal to `s`

State: **All variables, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k + 1]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j + 1]`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `s`, are integers greater than or equal to 1, and `k + 2 <= s**.
