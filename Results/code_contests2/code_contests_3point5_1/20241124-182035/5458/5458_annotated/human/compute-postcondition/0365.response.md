According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If s is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is 1. 
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
