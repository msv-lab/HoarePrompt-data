Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` remains unchanged, `k` is incremented by 2 in the if part and by 1 in the else part. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod plus dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
