Example Answer:
dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s + 1.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s + 1**
