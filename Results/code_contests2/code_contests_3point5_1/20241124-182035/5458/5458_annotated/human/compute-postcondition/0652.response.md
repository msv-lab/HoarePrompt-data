According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state to ensure the loop executes. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `s` are integers as per input values, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, `i` is 0**
