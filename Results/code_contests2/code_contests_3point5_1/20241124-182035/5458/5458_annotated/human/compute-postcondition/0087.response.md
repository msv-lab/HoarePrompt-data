Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k`, `s` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k`, `s` remain unchanged**
