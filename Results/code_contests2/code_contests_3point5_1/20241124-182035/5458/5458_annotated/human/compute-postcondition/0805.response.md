Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers at least 1. `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. `i` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of taking the previous value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and calculating its modulo with `mod`.***
