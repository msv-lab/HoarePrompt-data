Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k + 1`, and `k` is adjusted to `k + 1`. The dimensions of `dp` remain the same as (2, m + 2, s + 1). Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k + 1`, and `k` is adjusted to `k + 1`.
Output State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k + 1, `k` is adjusted to `k + 1**.
