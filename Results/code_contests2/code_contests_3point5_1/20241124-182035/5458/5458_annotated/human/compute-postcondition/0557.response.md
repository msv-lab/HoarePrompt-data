Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1`), `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and mod is an integer.
Output State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1`), `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and mod is an integer**
