Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. This postcondition covers all possible edge cases and scenarios after the execution of the if statement.***
