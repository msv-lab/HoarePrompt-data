According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 2. Since `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute one more time if `k` is incremented by 1, so `k` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` is 1, `k` is 4, `s` is at least 2**
