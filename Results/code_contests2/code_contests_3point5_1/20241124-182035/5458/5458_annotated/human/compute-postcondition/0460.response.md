Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. After the execution of the if statement where j >= k, the element at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] in dp is set to 1. The state of the program variables remains consistent with the initial conditions specified in the precondition, covering all possible edge cases within the given constraints.***
