Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The initial state of the variables is not determinable, so the final state cannot be accurately calculated. 
Output State: **Cannot determine the exact output state due to unknown initial values**
