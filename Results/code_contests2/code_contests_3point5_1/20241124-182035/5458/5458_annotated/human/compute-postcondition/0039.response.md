According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is in the range `[1, s+1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1). The specific index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1).**
