Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` where `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All other variables remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block.***
