At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`
- `i`
- `j`
- `k`
- `s` 

To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions provided:
1. If `s` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and the initial state is maintained.
2. When `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
3. In all other cases:
   - If `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
   - If `j <= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.
   - Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.
4. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and no changes are made to the variables.

Therefore, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `s` is less than 2, no changes are needed.
- If `s` is equal to or greater than 2:
  - Check the conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the current values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod`.
  - Update `i` to the appropriate value for the next iteration.
  - Update `j` to the appropriate value for the next iteration.
  - Update `k` to the appropriate value for the next iteration.
  - Update `s` to the appropriate value for the next iteration.
