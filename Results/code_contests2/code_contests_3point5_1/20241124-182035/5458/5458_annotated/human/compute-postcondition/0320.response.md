Output State: 
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers.
- If `s` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and the initial state is maintained.
- When `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
- In all other cases:
  - If `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
  - If `j <= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.
  - Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.
- If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and no changes are made to the variables.
