Example Answer:
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Given that i is either 0 or 1, j is 2, and k is in the range 1 to s + 1, the values in the dp array are shifted accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: dp remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), n is greater than 0, i is either 0 or 1, j is 2, and k is in the range 1 to s + 1.
Output State: **dp remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), n is greater than 0, i is either 0 or 1, j is 2, and k is in the range 1 to s + 1**
