Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the division between `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of the division between `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.***
