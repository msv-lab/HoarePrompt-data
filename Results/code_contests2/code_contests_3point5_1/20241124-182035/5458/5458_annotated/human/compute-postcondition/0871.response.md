Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2 and (i != 0)`. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
