Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values according to the given code. `j` and `k` are adjusted based on the loop conditions. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. For all other cases, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and then adding the modulus of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases involving the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, and `k`.**
