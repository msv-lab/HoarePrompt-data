According to the code and the given conditions:
1. `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1) throughout the loop execution.
2. `n` stays greater than 0.
3. `i` can be either 0 or 1 after the loop completes.
4. `j` stays within the range 1 to m + 1 after each iteration.
5. For the variable `k`, it takes on values from 1 to s during each iteration of the loop.
6. The loop will not execute if `s` is less than 1.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` can be either 0 or 1
- `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1
- `k` is within the range 1 to s (if loop executes) or remains unchanged if the loop does not execute (if s < 1).

Therefore, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is within the range 1 to s (if s > 1). If the loop does not execute (if s < 1), the variables retain their initial values.**
