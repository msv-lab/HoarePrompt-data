Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 3 and now `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to the new `k` value, then the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.***
