According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than `s` and `s` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to satisfy the condition `k < s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list, `k` is less than `s + 1` and `s` is greater than 0**
