Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are integers at least 1, `i` remains 2, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m + 1`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `dp` remains as a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with respect to `mod`.**
