Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, m and s are positive integers; dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, j is 1, k is 1. i is equal to 0. If j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. This assignment covers all cases where the if statement is executed and ensures that the value of dp is updated accordingly based on the given conditions.***
