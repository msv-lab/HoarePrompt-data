Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, and `s` is at least 1, `k` ranges from 1 to s inclusive, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program continues with no further changes in the state of the variables.***
