Output State: **`m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, `k` is adjusted based on the loop logic, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to have the same value as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `j` is greater than `k`**
