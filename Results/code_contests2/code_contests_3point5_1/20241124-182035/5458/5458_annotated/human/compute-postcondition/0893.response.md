Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
