Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s + 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `i` is 0, then the value at index (1, j + 1, k) in `dp` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k` and `i` is 1, the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If `j` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is 1, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and then incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. The postcondition ensures that all elements in `dp` maintain their initial values and relationships based on the conditions specified in the program fragment.***
