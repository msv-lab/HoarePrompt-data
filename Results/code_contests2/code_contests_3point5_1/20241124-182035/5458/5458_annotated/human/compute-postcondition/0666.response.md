Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is either 0 or not 0, j is 1, k is 1, and s is greater than or equal to 1. If i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then dp at index [1][2][1] is set to 1. If i is not 0 and j is greater than k, dp at index [1][j + 1][k] is updated with the value of dp at index [1][j][k]. Otherwise, dp at index [1][j + 1][k] is set to the remainder of dp at index [1][j][k] divided by mod, and then incremented by the value of dp at index [0][j][k - j] modulo mod.***
