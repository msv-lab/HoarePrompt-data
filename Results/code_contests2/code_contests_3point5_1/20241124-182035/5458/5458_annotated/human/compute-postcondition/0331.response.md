According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is within the range 1 to s + 1. Given that n is greater than 0, i is 0, and j is within the range 1 to m + 1, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is k, which should be set to 1.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is 1**
