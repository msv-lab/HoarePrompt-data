Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive, `mod` is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In cases where `i` is 1 and `j` is not greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed by taking the modulus of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod` and adding the modulus of the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. The overall state of the program variables remains consistent with the predefined conditions after the execution of the if else block, addressing all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
