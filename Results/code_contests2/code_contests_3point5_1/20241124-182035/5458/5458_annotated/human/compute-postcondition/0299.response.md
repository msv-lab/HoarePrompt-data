According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]`, `i`, `j`, `k = 1`, `s` are integers greater than or equal to 1. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 as the loop iterates over `xrange(1, s + 1)`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]`, `i`, `j`, `k = 2`, `s` are integers greater than or equal to 1**
