Example Answer:
The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The initial state mentions that `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, and the new value of `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. Since the code only affects the mentioned indexes of the 2D list `dp`, the output state is:
Output State: **`m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, and the new value of `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`**
