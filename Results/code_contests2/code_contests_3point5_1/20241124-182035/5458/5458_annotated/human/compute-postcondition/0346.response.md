Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. All other elements of `dp` remain unchanged.***
