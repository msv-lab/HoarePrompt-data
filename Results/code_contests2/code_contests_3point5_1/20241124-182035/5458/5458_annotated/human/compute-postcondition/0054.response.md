Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[1][3][1] is assigned 1. In all other cases, dp remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` > `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is then updated by summing the remainder of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] divided by mod.***
