According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1` are integers at least 1. `k + 1` is within the range of 1 to `s`. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. `i` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `k` should be within the range of 1 to `s`, meaning `k + 1` should be less than or equal to `s`. Since `k` is being incremented in each iteration, the next value of `k` should be adjusted to `k + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2` are integers at least 1. `k + 2` is within the range of 1 to `s`. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. `i` is 1**
