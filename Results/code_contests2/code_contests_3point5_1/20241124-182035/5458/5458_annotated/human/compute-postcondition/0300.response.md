Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, `i`, `j`, `k` are 2, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, `i`, `j`, `k` are 2, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1**
