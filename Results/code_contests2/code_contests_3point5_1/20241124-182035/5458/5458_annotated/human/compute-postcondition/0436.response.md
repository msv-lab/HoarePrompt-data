According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is within the range 1 to s. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to set `s` to be greater than or equal to 1, and `k` should be initialized to 1.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
