Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers where `n`, `m`, and `s` are at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` remains as a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is set to 1.***
