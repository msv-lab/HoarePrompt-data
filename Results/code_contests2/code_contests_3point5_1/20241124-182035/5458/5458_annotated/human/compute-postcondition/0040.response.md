Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 1. The loop updates the values in the `dp` list based on the conditions provided. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, specific indices in the `dp` list are set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, specific indices are updated with the value at a previous position. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the values are calculated using modulo operations. The loop will not execute if `k` is less than 1.**
