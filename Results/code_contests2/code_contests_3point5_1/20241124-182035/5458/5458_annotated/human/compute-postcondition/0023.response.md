Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) updated with the value 1 at the index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. `j` is 1, `k` is less than s. The program successfully updates the specified index in the 2D list `dp` to 1 when `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
