Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k + 1`, `k` is adjusted to `k + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod. In all other cases, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated based on the previous values in dp according to the conditions specified in the program fragment.***
