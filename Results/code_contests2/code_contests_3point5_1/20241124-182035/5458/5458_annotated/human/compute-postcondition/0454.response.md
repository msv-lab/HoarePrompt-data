Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1) where m, n, i, j, k, and s retain their initial properties. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program continues execution without any other changes in variables. All initial conditions remain unchanged.***
