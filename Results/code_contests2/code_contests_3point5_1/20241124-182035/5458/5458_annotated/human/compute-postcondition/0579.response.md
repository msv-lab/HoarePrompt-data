Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive, `mod` is an integer. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. In all other cases, the values of `dp` remain unchanged.***
