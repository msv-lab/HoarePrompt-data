Output State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1). `n` is greater than 0. `i` can be either 0 or 1. `j` is 2. `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive and is incremented by 1. `mod` is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `j` is greater than `m`, the loop will not execute, and all variables will maintain their initial conditions as described in the precondition.**
