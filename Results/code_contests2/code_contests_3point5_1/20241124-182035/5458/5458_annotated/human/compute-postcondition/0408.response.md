Postcondition: ***`n`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` maintain their initial conditions, `m` is greater than 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables or the array.***
