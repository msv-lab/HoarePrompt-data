Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, m and s are integers, dp is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, i is either 0 or not 0, j is 1, and k is s + 2 where s is greater than or equal to 1. If i == 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is not 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. All other variables and elements remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block.***
