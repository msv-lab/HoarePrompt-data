According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k + 1`, and `k` has been adjusted to `k + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `k` needs to be adjusted to `k + 1`, since it is being iterated over in the loop.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k + 1`, `k` is adjusted to `k + 2`**
