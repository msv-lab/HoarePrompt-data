Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding the modulo of the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
