Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list that remains updated based on the conditions within the loop, `k` is less than `s`, `s` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, no changes are made to `dp`.**
