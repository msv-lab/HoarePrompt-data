Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 2, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to s inclusive, and `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and the program continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the dp array. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the integrity and consistency of the program state after the if else block execution.***
