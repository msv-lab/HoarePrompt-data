Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned as 1. All other variables and dimensions remain unchanged.***
