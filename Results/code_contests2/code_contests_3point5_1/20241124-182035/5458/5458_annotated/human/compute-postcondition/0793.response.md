According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `k` should be within the range of 1 to `s` to satisfy the loop condition. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`.
