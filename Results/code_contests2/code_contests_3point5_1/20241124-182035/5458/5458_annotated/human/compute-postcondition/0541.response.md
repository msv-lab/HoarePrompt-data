According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k ranges from 1 to s inclusive. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` stays greater than 0, `i` remains either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to s inclusive, `s` is greater than 0**
