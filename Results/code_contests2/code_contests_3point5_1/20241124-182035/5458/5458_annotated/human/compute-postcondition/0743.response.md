Postcondition: ***`m` and `s` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, and `k` satisfies the conditions based on the loop logic. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the program execution, including edge cases where `i` is 0 or not 0, and different relationships between `j` and `k`.***
