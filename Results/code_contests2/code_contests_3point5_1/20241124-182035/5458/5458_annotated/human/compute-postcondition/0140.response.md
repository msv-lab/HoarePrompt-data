Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`, and `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. This ensures that the value at the next index is updated based on the condition `j > k`. This logic handles all possible scenarios and edge cases involving the variables and the 2D list `dp` effectively.***
