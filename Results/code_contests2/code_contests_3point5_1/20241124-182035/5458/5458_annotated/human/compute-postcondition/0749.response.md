Postcondition: ***`m` and `s` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, and the new value of `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues. This ensures that the state of the program variables is maintained and updated accordingly when `j` is greater than `k`.***
