Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known integers, and `s` is an integer. The output state after execution is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `s` are integers.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `s` are integers**
