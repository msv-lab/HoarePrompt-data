Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `s` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all other cases where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the variables.***
