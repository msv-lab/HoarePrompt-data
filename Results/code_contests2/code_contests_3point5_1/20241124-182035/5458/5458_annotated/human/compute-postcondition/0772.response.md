According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be updated to the next value within the range of 1 to `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: *`n` and `m` are integers at least 1, `s` is an integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`*.
