Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) all initialized with zeros, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1. After the execution of the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. This assignment occurs if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
