Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), where if i is 0 and j >= k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is 1 and j > k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. In all other cases, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by taking the modulo of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and then adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. The variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` maintain their initial conditions, ensuring the integrity of the program state for all possible ranges and values of `j` and `k`. `k` is incremented by 1**
