Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The previous values are `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, and `s` are integers. After execution, the output state is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `s` are integers.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `s` are integers**
