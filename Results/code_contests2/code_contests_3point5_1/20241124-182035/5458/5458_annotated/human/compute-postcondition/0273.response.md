Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `s` are integers. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. All variables maintain their initial integer values, ensuring the postcondition encompasses all possible outcomes and edge cases.***
