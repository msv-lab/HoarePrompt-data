Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1); `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s+1)`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the specific index dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program continues without changing any other variables.***
