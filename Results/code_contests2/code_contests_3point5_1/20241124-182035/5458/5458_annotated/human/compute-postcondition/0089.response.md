According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`. The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `k` by 1, as it iterates through the range of 1 to `s`. No other states need adjustment.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` and `k` remain unchanged, `k` is incremented by 1**
