According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is an integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` should be greater than or equal to 1.
No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
