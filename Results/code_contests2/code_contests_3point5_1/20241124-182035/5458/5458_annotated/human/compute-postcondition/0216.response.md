According to the code provided, the loop will execute based on the value of `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers. The values of `j` and `k` are adjusted based on the loop conditions. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `s` needs to be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.
- The values of `j` and `k` need to be adjusted according to the loop conditions.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` and `k` are adjusted, `s` is at least 2**
