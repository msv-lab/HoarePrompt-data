According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is the next value after the last iteration.

To adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:
1. Update `k` to be the next value after the current value.
2. Update `j` to reflect the conditions mentioned in the loop.
3. If the condition where `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` is met, set the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] to 1.
4. If the above condition is not met, update the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] based on the logic provided in the loop.
5. Update dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values, `j` is adjusted based on the loop conditions, `k` is the next value after the current value**
