Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and the loop continues. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. All other variables and lists retain their initial values.***
