Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1). `n` is greater than 0. `i` is either 0 or 1. `j` is 2. `k` is in the range 1 to s + 1. If j > k, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The state of the program variables remains consistent with the initial precondition, ensuring the integrity of the 2D list `dp` and the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `k` after the execution of the if statement.***
