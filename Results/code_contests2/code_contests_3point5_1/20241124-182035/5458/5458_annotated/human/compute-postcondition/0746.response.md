Postcondition: ***`m`, `s` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is 3, and the new value of `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. This ensures that the specific cell in the 2D list `dp` is updated correctly based on the conditions provided.***
