Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]`, `i`, `j`, `k = 1`, `s` are integers greater than or equal to 1. Initially, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. For all other cases where `i` is not 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. This postcondition covers all possible edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the if-else block executes.***
