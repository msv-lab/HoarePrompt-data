Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the specific values after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list, `k` is less than `s + 1` and `s` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list, `k` is less than `s + 1` and `s` is greater than 0**
