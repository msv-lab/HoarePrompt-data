According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the range of k is from 1 to s inclusive. Before the loop starts, `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1) ensures that the loop will execute. `n` being greater than 0, `i` being either 0 or 1, and `j` being 1 are already in the correct state. To adjust for the loop to execute, `k` needs to be set to 1.
State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
