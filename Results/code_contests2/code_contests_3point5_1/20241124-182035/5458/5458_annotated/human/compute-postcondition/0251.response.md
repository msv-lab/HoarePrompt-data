According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, if `s` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, otherwise the following adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, set `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the previous value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- Otherwise, calculate `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` as the modulo of the previous value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, then increment by the remainder of the division between `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.
- If `i` is non-zero and `j` is not greater than `k`, update the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be the remainder of the division between `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`, then increase `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by the remainder of the division between `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.

State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` adjusted according to the conditions mentioned above based on the previous iteration state**
