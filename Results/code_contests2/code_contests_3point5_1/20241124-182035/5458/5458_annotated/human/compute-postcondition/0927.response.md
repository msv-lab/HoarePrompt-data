Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, where `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` where `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` where `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
