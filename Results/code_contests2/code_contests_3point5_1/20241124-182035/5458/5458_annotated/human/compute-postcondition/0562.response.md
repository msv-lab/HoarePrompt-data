Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, `m + 2`, `s + 1)`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and mod is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified by taking the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
