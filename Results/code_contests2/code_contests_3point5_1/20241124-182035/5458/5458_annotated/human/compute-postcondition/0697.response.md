Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, `i` is not 0, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
