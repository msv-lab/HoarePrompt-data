Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is within the range 1 to m + 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
