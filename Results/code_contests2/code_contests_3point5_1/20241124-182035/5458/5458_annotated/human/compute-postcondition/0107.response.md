According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range (1, s + 1). At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` remains unchanged, and `k` is the next value in the range (1, s + 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`, which should be updated to the next value in the range (1, s + 1).
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1). `j` remains unchanged. `k` is the next value in the range (1, s + 1)**
