According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 2. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2**
