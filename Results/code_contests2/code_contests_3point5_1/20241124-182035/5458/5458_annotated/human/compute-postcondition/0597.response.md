According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, and `mod` is an integer.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Increment `k` by 1 to move to the next iteration within the range of 1 to `s + 1`.
- Reset the conditions based on the new values of `k` to ensure the loop conditions are met.
  
State: **`dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` inclusive, `mod` is an integer, where `k` is incremented by 1**
