Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, with `n` and `m` being at least 1, and `s` being at least 1. `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2`. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. No other changes occur in the variables.***
