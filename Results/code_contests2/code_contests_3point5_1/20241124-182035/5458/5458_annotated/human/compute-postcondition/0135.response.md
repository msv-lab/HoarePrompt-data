According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`, and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s`, and the other states remain the same.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) with updated values. `j` is at least 1, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`, and `s` is at least 1**
