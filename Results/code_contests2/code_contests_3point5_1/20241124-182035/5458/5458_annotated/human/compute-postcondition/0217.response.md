According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, and `k` are already positive integers and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1). Since the loop starts from 1, `j` needs to be adjusted to 1. Additionally, `s` is required to be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1), `j` is 1, `k` are adjusted, `s` is at least 2**
