The function func continuously takes input of integer values for n, m, and s, updates an array dp based on specific conditions, and calculates the remainder of dp[n, m+1, s] modulo mod. The loop terminates when n, m, and s are all equal to 0. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
