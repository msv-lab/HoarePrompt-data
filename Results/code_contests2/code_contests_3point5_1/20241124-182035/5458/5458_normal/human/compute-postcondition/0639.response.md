Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 3, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod` to the previous value. The postcondition covers all possible edge cases ensuring the correct updating of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the conditions specified.***
