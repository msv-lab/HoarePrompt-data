According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m, s is at least 1, i, j + 1, k is 1, and dp is a 2D list with updated values based on specified conditions for the next iteration. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Since the loop iterates over `k` from 1 to s, increment the value of `k` by 1.
- Ensure that all other states remain the same, as there are no specific conditions mentioned that require adjustment.

State: *mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m, s is at least 1, i, j + 1, k is 2, dp is a 2D list with updated values based on the specified conditions*
