Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the initial value, `k` is incremented by 1, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], where dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
