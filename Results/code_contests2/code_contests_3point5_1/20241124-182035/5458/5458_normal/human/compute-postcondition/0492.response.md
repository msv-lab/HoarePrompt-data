According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all at least 1, and `k` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1 as it is the iterating variable.
- No other states need adjustment as they are not directly related to the loop iteration.

State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are all at least 1, and `k` has been incremented by 2**
