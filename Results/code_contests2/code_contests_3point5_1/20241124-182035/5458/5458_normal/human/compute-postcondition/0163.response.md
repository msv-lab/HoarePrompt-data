Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1**
