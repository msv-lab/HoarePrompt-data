Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m, s, i, j, k` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` by `(s + 1)`. `i` is now 0, `j` is within the range 1 to `m`, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the value 1.**
