According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` values are adjusted, `s` is at least 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, `k` is less than or equal to `s+1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the value of `k` needs to be adjusted to `k` is less than or equal to `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` values are adjusted, `s` is at least 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, `k` is less than or equal to `s**`
