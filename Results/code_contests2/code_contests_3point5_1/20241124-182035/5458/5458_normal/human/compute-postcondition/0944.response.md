Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is either 0 or any other value. `j` is any value greater than or equal to 1. `m` is any value. `k` is 1. After the execution of the if statement, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The postcondition includes all possible scenarios and ensures the variables maintain their initial values and constraints, encapsulating the various outcomes of the if else block.***
