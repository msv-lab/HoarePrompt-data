Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Based on the given initial state, `k` is between 2 and `s`, and the `dp` array is updated accordingly by copying the value from the previous index. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is between 2 and `s`, `dp` array is updated based on the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **`k` is between 2 and `s`, `dp` array is updated based on the conditions mentioned above**
