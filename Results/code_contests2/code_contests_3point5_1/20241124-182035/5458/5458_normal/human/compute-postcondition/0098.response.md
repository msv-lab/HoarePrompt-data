According to the code, the loop will execute again if the value of `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has been incremented to the next value in the range 1 to `s`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range 1 to `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` and `s` are at least 1, `i` and `j` are 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on conditions, `k` is incremented to the next value in the range 1 to `s`**
