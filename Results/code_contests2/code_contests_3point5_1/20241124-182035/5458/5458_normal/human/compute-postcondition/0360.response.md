Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers initialized to 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s+1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
