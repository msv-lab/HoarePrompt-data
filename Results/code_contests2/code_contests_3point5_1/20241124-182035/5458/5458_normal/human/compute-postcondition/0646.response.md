Output State: 
- If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and the values of the variables remain the same.
- If `n` is greater than 0, after the loop executes:
    - `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `s` remains at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers initialized to 1, `k` is incremented based on the loop range.
    - If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
    - If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
    - For all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
    - The loop will execute at least once if `s` is at least 1. If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute.
- If `s` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, leaving the variables at their initial values.
- After the loop completes its iterations, the final values of the variables are as follows: `s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the final value after the loop completes its iterations, `k` is the final value after the loop completes its iterations.
- Finally, `print(dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod)` is executed to output the result.
Output State: **Final values of the variables are updated as described above, and the result of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod` is printed.**
