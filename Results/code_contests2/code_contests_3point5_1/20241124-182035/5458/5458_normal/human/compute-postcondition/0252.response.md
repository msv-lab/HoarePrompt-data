According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive). Therefore, the states need to be adjusted such that k is within the specified range. Additionally, based on the specific conditions within the loop for updating the `dp` array, we need to adjust the states involving `i`, `j`, and `k` accordingly.

State: **`j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` and `k` are dependent on the specific conditions within the loop for updating the `dp` array**
