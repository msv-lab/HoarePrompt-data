Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1` and `k` are integers. `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the execution continues without any changes in the state. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there are no changes in the variables `dp`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, and `k` after the execution of the program fragment.***
