Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m, s is at least 1, i, j + 1, k is 2, dp is a 2D list with updated values based on the specified conditions. If i == 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i > 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and the loop continues. If i > 0 and j <= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by taking the sum of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. All other states remain unchanged as per the precondition***
