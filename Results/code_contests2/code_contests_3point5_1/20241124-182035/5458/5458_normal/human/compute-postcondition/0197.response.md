Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of variables are not explicitly given, so the output state is: `dp` values are adjusted, `s` is at least 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, `k` is less than or equal to `s+1`.
Output State: **`dp` values are adjusted, `s` is at least 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, `k` is less than or equal to `s+1`**
