According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `k` is less than `s`, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`. It should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
State: **`i` is 0, `j` equals `m`, `k` is 4, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
