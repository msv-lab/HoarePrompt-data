Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i is 1, j is greater than 1, and k is 2, the value is stored in dp[0][j + 1][2]. Therefore, the output state is: i is 1, j is an integer greater than 1, m is greater than or equal to 1, s is greater than or equal to 1, k is 2, and dp[0][j + 1][2] is assigned 1.
Output State: **i is 1, j is an integer greater than 1, m is greater than or equal to 1, s is greater than or equal to 1, k is 2, dp[0][j + 1][2] is assigned 1**
