According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `s` is at least 1, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` is 3, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since `k` is incremented in the loop, it should be adjusted to `k` is 4.
2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `s` is at least 1, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` is 4, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values**
