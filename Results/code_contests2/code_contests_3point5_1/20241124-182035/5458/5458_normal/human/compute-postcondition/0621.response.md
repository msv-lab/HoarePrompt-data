Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 1, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j+1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is equal to or less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
