Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 1, 1, and 1 respectively. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers incremented to 2, `k` is incremented to 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers incremented to 2, `k` is incremented to 2**
