Postcondition: ***`k` is between 2 and `s`, all other variables remain the same. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In both cases, if `j` is greater than `k`, the elements of the `dp` array are updated by taking modulo `mod` operations. Additionally, when `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
