Output State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program continues executing without any changes to the other variables. The range of `k` is from 1 to `s + 1 + 1`, covering all possible values within this range.**
