Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i`, `j`, and `m` are any values, `k` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program state after the if block execution maintains the initial conditions and updates the specific value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the given condition.***
