Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` and `j` are integers.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` and `j` are integers**
