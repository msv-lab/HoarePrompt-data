Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` equals `s - 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
