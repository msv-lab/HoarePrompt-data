Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, which means the value of the variable on the left side of the assignment is updated based on the value of the variable on the right side. After that, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated and incremented according to the given calculations.**
