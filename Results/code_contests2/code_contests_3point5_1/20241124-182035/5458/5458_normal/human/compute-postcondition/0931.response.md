According to the code, the loop will execute over the range of `k` from 1 to `s + 1`. 
- `i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` are integers, and their values remain unchanged after the loop execution.
- If `s + 1` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged.
- At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` are already set, and they do not need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` remain unchanged**
