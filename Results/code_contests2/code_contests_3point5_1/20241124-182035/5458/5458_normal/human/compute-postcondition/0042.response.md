According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, mod is 100000 does not affect the loop execution. To ensure the loop can execute, `k` needs to start from 1 and `s` needs to be at least 1. 
State: **mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m, s is at least 1, i, j + 1, k is 1, dp is a 2D list with updated values based on the specified conditions for the next iteration**
