Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
