Output State: 
- `mod` remains 100000
- `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are all at least 1
- `k` is incremented based on the loop range
- If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and all variables remain unchanged
- If `i` equals 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1
- If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`
- If `i` is not 0 and `j <= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, then it is increased by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod` after the loop executes.
