According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all at least 1, and `k` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `k` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be adjusted to `k + 1`.
- No other states need to be adjusted as they meet the conditions specified in the loop statement.

State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1` are all at least 1**
