Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m, s, i, j, k` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` by `(s + 1)`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` where the new value is the modulus of the previous value by `mod`.**
