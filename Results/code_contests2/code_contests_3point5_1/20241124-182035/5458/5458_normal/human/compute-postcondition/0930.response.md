Output State: 
- `i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` are integers.
- The loop executes over the range of `k` from 1 to `s + 1`.
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.
- Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.
- The values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` remain unchanged after the loop execution.
- If `s + 1` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged.
