Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are less than or equal to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program state remains consistent with the initial values and constraints.**
