Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 2, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j+1][k]` is set to 1. After the execution of the if statement, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is also set to 1. All other variables retain their initial values and relationships.***
