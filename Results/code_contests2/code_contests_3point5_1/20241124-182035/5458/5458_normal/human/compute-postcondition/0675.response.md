Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is less than or equal to 2, no change occurs to the variables.***
