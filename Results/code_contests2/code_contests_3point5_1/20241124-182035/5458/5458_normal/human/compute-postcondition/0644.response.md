According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, if `s` is equal to or greater than 1, the loop will update the values of `dp` based on the conditions specified in the loop body. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n ** 2`.
State: **If `s` is less than 1, all variables retain their initial values. If `s` is equal to or greater than 1, `dp`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are based on the conditions met during the last iteration.**
