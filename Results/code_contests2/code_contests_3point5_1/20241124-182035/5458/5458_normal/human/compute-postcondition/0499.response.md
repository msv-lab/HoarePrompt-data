Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are all at least 1, `k` has been incremented by 2, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`**
