Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer, `k` is set to `s + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list updated based on loop conditions.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer, `k` is set to `s + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list updated based on loop conditions**
