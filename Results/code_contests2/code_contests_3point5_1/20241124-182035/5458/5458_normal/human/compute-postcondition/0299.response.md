According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented. Therefore, for the next iteration, `k` should be updated to `k + 1`.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
