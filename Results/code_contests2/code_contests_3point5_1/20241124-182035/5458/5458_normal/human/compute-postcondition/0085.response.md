Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` and `s` are at least 1, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on conditions. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program state remains consistent with the initial conditions and the updated value of `dp` reflects the correct relationships between the variables.***
