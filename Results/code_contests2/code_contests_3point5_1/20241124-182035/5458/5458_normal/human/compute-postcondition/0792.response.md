According to the code and the given conditions, we need to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time. Here are the adjustments that need to be made:

1. Since the loop is iterating over `j` in the range from 1 to `m+1`, we need to increment `j` by 1.
2. Since `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, after the previous iteration, `j` should be incremented to continue the loop. Therefore, `j` should be incremented by 1.
3. No other states need to be adjusted based on the conditions provided.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer that ranges from 1 to `s`**
