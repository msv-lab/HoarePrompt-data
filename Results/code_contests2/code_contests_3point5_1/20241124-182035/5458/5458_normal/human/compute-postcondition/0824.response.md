According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers where `j` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be updated to the next value in the range of 1 to `s`. So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k + 1`**
