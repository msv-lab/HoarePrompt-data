According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `k` ranging from 1 to `s+2` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are less than or equal to `m`, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s+2`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` should be updated to `k` ranges from 1 to `s+2+1`, as the loop condition checks for `k` up to `s+2`.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are less than or equal to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s+2+1`**
