Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` and `s` are at least 1, `i`, `j`, `k` are 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on conditions. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
