According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the final value after the loop completes its iterations, `k` is the final value after the loop completes its iterations. The loop handles scenarios where `i == 0` and `j >= k`, setting `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1, or when `i > 0` and `j > k`, updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `s` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`s` is at least 1**
