Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` and `s` are at least 1, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on conditions. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
