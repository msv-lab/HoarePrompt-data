Output State: `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers where `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
