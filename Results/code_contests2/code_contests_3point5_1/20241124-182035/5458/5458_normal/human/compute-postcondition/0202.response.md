Postcondition: ***`dp` values are adjusted, `s` is at least 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, `k` is less than or equal to `s+1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
