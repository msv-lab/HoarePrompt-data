Example Answer:
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The state of variables mod, n, m, s, i, j, dp, and k remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m, s, i, j are integers, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) by (s + 1), k is adjusted to the next value after the current value.
Output State: **mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m, s, i, j are integers, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) by (s + 1), k is adjusted to the next value after the current value**
