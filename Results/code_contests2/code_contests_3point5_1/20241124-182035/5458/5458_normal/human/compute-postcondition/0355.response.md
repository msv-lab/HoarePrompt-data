Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers initialized to 1, `k` is incremented by 1, and `k` is less than or equal to `s+1`, after the execution of the if statement, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. All initial conditions are maintained, and the assignment of 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is reflected in the postcondition.***
