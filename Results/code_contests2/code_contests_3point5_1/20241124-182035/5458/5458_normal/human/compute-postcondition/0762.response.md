Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `i` = 1, `j` = 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` = 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. As the assignment does not depend on the previous states, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
