According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The loop will not execute if `s` is less than 1, and in that case, all variables will retain their initial values. So the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is that `j` should be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, then adjust the states accordingly.**
