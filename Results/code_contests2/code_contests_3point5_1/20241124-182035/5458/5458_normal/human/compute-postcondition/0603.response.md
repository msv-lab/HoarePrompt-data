Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop or statement continues to the next iteration. After running the code snippet, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
