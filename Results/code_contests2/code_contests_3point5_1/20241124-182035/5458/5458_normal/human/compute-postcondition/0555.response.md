Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i, j, k` are not specified, but `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1. Therefore, the output state is: `mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are at least 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are at least 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
