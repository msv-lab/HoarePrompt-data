According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is adjusted to the next value after the current value. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to the value after the current next value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list containing calculated values, `k` is adjusted to the next value after the current next value**
