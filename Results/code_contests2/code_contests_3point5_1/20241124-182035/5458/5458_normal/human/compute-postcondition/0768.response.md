Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop or iteration continues without affecting the state. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
