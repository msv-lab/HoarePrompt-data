Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are less than or equal to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, followed by updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
