According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers with values 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range `[1, s + 1)`, which means incrementing `k` by 1.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers with values 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is the next value in the range `[1, s + 1)`**
