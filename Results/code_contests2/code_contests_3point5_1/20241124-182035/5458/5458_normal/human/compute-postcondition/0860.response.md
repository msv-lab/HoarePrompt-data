According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, `i`, and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, if `j` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is 1, the loop will execute, and the values in the dp array will be updated accordingly. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be based on the previous values in the dp array. Keeping this in mind, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:
State: **Adjustments depend on the specific conditions met at the end of the previous iteration, so specific values need to be checked and updated accordingly**
