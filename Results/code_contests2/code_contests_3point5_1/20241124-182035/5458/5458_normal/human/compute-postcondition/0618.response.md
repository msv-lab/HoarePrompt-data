Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 1, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j+1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The state of the program variables is consistent with the specified initial conditions, considering the edge cases where `j` might be equal to `k` or `s` might not be greater than or equal to `m`.***
