According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for updating `dp` array were based on `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since the loop is based on `j`, we need to focus on adjusting `j` for the next iteration. 

If the loop is to execute one more time, `j` should be less than or equal to `m`. Additionally, based on the conditions provided for updating the `dp` array in the loop, the states of `i`, `j`, and `k` should also be considered. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **Adjust `j` to be less than or equal to `m`. Other states involving `i`, `j`, and `k` should be adjusted based on the specific conditions within the loop for updating the `dp` array.**
