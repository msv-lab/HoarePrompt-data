Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers where `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After the execution, the program maintains the initial values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` along with the assigned value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` if the condition is satisfied.***
