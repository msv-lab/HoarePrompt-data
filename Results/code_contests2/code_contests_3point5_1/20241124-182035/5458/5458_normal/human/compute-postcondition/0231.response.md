According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is between 1 and `s`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. All other variables remain the same.
State: **`k` is between 2 and `s`, all other variables remain the same**
