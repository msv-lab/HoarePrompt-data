According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. For all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then augmented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The variable `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `s` under all circumstances.

To execute the loop one more time, the only state that needs adjustment is `k`. Since `k` is currently at the end of the previous iteration, to execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k + 1` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][(k + 1)]` will be affected based on the conditions specified in the code.
