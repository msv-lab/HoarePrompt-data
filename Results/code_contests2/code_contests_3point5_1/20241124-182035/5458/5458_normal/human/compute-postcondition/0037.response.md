Output State: **mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m, s, i, j, k are integers, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) by (s + 1). If j is greater than k, then the value in dp at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as the value in dp at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k] after taking the modulo operation with mod.**
