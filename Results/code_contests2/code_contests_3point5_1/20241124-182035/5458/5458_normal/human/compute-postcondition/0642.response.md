According to the code, the loop will execute if `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 1, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, and `i` equals 0 with `j` greater than or equal to `k`.
Given the initial state:
- `s` is greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is at least 1
- `s` is equal to or greater than `m`
- `i` equals 0
- `j` greater than or equal to `k`

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` should be updated to 1
- `j` should be updated to `m + 1`
- `k` should remain the same
- Other variables remain the same

State: **Output State: If `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 1, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, and `i` equals 1 with `j` greater than or equal to `k**
