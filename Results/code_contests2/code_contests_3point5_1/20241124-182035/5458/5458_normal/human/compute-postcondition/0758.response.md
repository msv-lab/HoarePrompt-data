According to the code, the loop can execute if `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `m`. Before the loop starts, `i`, `s`, and `k` do not affect the loop execution, so they can remain as they are. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`i`, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` are integers**
