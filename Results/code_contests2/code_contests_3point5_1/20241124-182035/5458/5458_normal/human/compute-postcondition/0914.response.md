Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` are integers, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1 + 1`.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` are integers, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1 + 1**
