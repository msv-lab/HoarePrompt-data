Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are updated by mapping the input values to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since the initial state of variables is unknown, the output state will be `n`, `m`, and `s` are updated based on the input values provided.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are updated based on the input values provided**
