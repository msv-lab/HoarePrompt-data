According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` values need to be adjusted accordingly and `j` should be less than or equal to `m+1`. So, for the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1, `dp` values must be adjusted, and `j` should be less than or equal to `m+1`.
State: **`dp` values adjusted, `s` is at least 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1**.
