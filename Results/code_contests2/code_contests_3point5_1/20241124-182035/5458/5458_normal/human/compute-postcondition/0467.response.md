According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1` are all at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `k + 1` should be less than or equal to `s` to ensure that `k` is within the range of iteration.
2. The conditions for assigning values to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be checked based on the given criteria.

State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1` are all at least 1, `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`**
