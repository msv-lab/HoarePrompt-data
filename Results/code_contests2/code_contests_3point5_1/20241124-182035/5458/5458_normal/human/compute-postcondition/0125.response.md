Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer, `k` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list updated based on loop conditions. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then the element at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j > k`, then the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the previous value at `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo `mod` of the sum of the previous value at `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
