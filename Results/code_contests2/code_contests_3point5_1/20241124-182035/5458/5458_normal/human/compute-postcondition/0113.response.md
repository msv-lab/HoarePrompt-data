According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted such that `s` is at least 1 and `k` is set to 1 as it starts from 1 in the loop.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list updated based on the loop conditions**
