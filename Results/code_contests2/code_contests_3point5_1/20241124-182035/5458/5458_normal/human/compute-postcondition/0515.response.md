Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are less than or equal to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
