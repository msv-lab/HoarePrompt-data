According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are less than or equal to `m`, and `k` had the value of `s+1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to the next value which is `s+2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`mod` remains 100000. `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are less than or equal to `m`. `k` ranges from 1 to `s+2` inclusive**.
