Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The initial states of the variables are as follows: `i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2. The assignment does not change the initial state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2**
