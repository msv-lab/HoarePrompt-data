According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is in the range from 1 to `s` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. Since the values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged after the execution of the program fragment, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3**
