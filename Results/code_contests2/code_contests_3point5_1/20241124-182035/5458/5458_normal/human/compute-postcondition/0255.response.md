Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known to be 0, `j`, and `k` respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, and the `dp` array is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, and the `dp` array is updated accordingly**
