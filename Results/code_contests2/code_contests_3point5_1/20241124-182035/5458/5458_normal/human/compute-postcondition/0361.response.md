Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers initialized to 1, `k` is incremented by 1, and `k` is less than or equal to `s+1, after the execution of the if statement, if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
