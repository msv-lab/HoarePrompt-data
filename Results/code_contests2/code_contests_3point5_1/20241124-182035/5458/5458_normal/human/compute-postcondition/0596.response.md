Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if-else block.***
