According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 2, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j+1][k]` is set to 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to continue the loop.
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` needs to be initialized or updated based on the conditions mentioned in the if else block.
- All other variables retain their initial values and relationships.

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 3, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set according to the conditions in the if else block**
