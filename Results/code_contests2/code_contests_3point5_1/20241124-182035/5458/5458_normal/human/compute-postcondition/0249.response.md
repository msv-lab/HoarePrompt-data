According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is an integer between 2 and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is an integer between 2 and `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to the next integer value between 2 and `s`.
State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and `s + 1`, `dp` array is updated based on the conditions mentioned above**
