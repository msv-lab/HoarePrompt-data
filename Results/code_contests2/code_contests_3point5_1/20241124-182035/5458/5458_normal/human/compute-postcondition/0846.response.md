Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After running the code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
