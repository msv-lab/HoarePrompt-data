According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `i` remains 0 as there is no condition or operation specified to change it.
- `j` should remain less than `m` as there is no condition to modify it.
- `k` should be incremented to the next value within the range of 1 to `s + 1`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to `s + 1`**
