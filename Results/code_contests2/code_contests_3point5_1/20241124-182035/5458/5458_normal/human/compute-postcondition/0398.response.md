According to the given conditions:
1. The loop will execute at least once if `s` is at least 1. If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute. Since `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute again.
2. `i` is either 0 or 1, and if `i` is 0, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, `i` should remain 0 for the next iteration.
3. `j` is initially 2, and it is incremented in each iteration. Since `j` is incremented based on the loop, it does not need to be adjusted.
4. `k` is not specifically mentioned, but based on the conditions given, it should be adjusted based on the loop execution.
5. Other variables such as `mod` and `m` do not need to be adjusted as they remain constant.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is incremented based on the loop, `k` is adjusted based on the loop**
