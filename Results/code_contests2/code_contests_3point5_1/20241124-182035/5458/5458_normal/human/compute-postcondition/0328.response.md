Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` and `s` are at least 1, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, maintaining the initial conditions of the variables, then `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` by `(s + 1)`, `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned the integer values entered by the user.**
