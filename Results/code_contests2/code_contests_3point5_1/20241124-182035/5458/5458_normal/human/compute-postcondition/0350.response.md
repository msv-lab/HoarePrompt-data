Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers initialized to 2, `k` is incremented by 2. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of dividing the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod` and the loop continues.**
