According to the code, for the loop to execute, `k` needs to range from 1 to `s` inclusive. At the start of the loop, `k` is not an issue as it is already ranging from 1 to `s` inclusive. The key variables that need adjustment are `i`, `j`, and `m`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
- `i` needs to be set to 0
- `j` needs to be less than `m`
- `k` remains the same as before

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`**
