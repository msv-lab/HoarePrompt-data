According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers with values 1, `i` remains the same, `j` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` should be incremented to the next value within the range of 1 to `s`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1` are integers with values 1, `i` remains the same, `j` is incremented by 1**
