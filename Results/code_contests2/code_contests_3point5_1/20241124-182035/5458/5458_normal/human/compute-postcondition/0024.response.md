Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. The dimensions of `dp` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m, s, i, j` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` by `(s + 1)`, `k` is adjusted to the next value after the last iteration.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m, s, i, j` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` by `(s + 1)`, `k` is adjusted to the next value after the last iteration**
