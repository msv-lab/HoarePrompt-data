According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k`, `s`, and the conditions regarding `i` and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1` are integers with values 1, `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is incremented by 1. 

1. Since `k` is the loop variable, it needs to be adjusted to move to the next value for the next iteration. Therefore, `k` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers with values 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1**

This adjustment ensures that the loop can execute one more time considering the conditions specified in the code.
