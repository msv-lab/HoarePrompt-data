Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m, s, i, j are integers, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) by (s + 1), k is adjusted to the next value after the last iteration. If i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is not 0 and j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] where the new value is the modulus of the previous value by mod. All variables maintain their initial conditions and the program state remains consistent after the execution of the if-else block, handling all possible edge cases.***
