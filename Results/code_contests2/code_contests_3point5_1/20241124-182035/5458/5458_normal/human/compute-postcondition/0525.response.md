Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000. `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are less than or equal to `m`. `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1` inclusive. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`, and it is increased by the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.***
