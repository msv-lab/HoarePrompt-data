According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `j` is not explicitly mentioned in the loop condition, we don't need to adjust the state for `j`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is equal to or greater than `m`.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`**
