Output State: **If `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 1, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, and `i` equals 0 with `j` greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions specified in the code block. The postcondition covers all possible combinations of values for `s`, `k`, `m`, `i`, and `j`, ensuring the correct behavior of the program.**
