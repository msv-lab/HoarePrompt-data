Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned to 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1 + 1`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` are integers, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1 + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` are integers, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1 + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
