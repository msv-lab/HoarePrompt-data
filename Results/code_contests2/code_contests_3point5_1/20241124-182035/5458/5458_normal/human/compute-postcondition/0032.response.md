Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list with values assigned to specific indices, `k` is adjusted to the next value after the current value. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the entry at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is set to 1.***
