Since the loop condition is `while 1`, it will continue indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body. Therefore, we can assume that the loop will execute one more time. Hence, we need to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **If `n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` and `s` are at least 1, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, and `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` by `(s + 1)`**
