Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. This assignment occurs for all valid initial variable values, ensuring that the dp array is updated accordingly for future calculations.***
