Postcondition: ***`j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is 0, `k` is dependent on the specific conditions within the loop for updating the `dp` array. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the `dp` array at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
