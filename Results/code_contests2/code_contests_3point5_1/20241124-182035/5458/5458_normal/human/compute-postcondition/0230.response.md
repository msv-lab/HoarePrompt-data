Postcondition: ***`k` is between 1 and `s`, all other variables remain the same. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod, and then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if else block.***
