Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Since `i` is 0, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and other variables remain the same, the updated variable values are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
