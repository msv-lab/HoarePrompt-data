Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the dp list. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, `m`, and 2 respectively. Therefore, the element at index `[1][m + 1][2]` in the dp list is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. The element at index `[1][m + 1][2]` in the dp list is assigned the value 1**
