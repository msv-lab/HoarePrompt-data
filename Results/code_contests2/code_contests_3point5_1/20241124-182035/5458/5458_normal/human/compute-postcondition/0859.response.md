Output State: **If `j` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is 1, then the loop will execute and update the values in the dp array accordingly. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be based on the previous values in the dp array. The loop covers all possible scenarios and edge cases effectively.**
