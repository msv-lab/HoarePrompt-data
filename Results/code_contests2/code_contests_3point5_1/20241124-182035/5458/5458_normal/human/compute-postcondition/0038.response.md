Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m, s, i, j are integers, dp is a 2D list containing calculated values, k is adjusted to the next value after the current value. If i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then the entry at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] in dp is assigned the value 1. If i is not 0 and j is greater than k, then the value in dp at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as the value in dp at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If j is not greater than k, the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] in dp is updated to be the remainder of the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k] in dp divided by mod. Additionally, this updated value is incremented by the remainder of the value at index [i & 1][j][k - j] in dp divided by mod.***
