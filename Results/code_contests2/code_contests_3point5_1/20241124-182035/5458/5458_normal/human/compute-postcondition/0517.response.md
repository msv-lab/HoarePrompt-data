According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are less than or equal to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are less than or equal to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1` inclusive**

This adjustment ensures that the loop can execute one more time with the incremented value of `k`.
