According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 3, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3. To execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than `s + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than `s`, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3**
