Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the given conditions in the else part of the if statement.***
