Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and then incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
