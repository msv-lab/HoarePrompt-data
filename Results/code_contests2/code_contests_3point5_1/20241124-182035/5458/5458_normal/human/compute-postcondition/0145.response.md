Output State: **If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then the element at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j > k`, then the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the previous value at `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo `mod` of the sum of the previous value at `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `[i & 1][j][k - j]`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the element at position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is determined as follows: if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, else `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
