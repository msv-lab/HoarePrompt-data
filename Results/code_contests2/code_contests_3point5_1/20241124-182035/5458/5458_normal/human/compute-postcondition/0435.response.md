According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `m` is at least 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `mod` remains 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` remains at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is incremented based on the loop range.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` remains at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is incremented based on the loop range**
