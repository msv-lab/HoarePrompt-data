Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of these variables. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, and the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, and the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
