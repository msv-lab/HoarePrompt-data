Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are at least 1, and `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are at least 1, and `k` is incremented by 1**
