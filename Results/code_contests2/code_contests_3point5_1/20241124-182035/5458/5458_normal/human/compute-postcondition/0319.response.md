According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s` and the conditions related to `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to the current value.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `s` must be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **If `s` is greater than or equal to 1, then the loop can execute. Otherwise, the loop does not execute.**
