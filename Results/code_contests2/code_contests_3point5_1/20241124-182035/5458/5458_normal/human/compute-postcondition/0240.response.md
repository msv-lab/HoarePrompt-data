According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is between 2 and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is between 2 and `s`, all other variables remain the same. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is set to 1. Therefore, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be set to 1 at the start of the next iteration.
2. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Thus, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the elements of the `dp` array are updated by taking modulo `mod` operations. So, if `j` is greater than `k`, all elements in the `dp` array should be updated by taking modulo `mod` operations.
4. Additionally, when `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. Therefore, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be incremented by the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

State: **`k` is between 2 and `s`, `dp` array is updated based on the conditions mentioned above**.
