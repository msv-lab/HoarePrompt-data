Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. `j` is any value greater than or equal to 1. `m` is any value. `k` is 1. After the execution of the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The postcondition covers all possible cases, ensuring that the specified variables maintain their initial values, constraints, and relationships.***
