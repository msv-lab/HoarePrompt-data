Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is incremented based on the loop, `k` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`, otherwise no changes occur. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
