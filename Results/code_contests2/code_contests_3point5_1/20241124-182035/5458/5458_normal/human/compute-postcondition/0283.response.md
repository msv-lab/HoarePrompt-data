According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `k` is less than `s` is met. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than `s`, and the next value of `k` is `k + 1. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `k`, which should be updated to `k + 1`.
State: **`j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` and specific conditions within the loop for updating the `dp` array, `k` is less than `s`, and the next value of `k` is `k + 1**
