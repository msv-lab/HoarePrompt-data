Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` and `s` are at least 1, `i` and `j` are 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on conditions, `k` is incremented to the next value in the range 1 to `s`, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. This update covers all possible edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the if statement executes.***
