Postcondition: ***`i` is 0 or 1. `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers where `j` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than 1, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`, or it is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod` if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
