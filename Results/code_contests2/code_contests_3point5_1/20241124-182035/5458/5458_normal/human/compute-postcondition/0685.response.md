According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are all 0, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2**
