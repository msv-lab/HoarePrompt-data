Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. All the initial conditions hold true, and in the specific case where `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1.***
