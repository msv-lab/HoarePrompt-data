Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` remain unchanged, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` remain unchanged, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
