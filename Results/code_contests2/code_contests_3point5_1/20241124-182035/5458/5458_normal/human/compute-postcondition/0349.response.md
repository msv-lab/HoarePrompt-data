Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers initialized to 1, `k` is incremented by 1. After the if statement executes, `i` and `j` are incremented to 2, `k` is incremented to 2. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues.***
