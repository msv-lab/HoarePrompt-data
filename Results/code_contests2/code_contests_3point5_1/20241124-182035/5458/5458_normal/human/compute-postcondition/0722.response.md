According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `m`, so no adjustments are needed for these variables. However, for the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `k` should be 1.
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
