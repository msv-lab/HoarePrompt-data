Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` are integers, where `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1 + 1` (updated value). If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues without any changes in the state. Otherwise, there are no changes in the state of the variables `i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` after the execution of the if-else block.***
