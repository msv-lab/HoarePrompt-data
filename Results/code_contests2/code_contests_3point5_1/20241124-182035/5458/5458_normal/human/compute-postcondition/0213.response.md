Output State: 
- `dp` values are adjusted after the loop execution.
- `s` is at least 1.
- `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`.
- `k` is less than or equal to `s+1`.
- If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
- If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
- If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of dividing the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`, and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.

If `s` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute and the `dp` values will remain unchanged.
