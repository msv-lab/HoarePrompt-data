According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` and `j` are integers. The conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since `k` is the loop variable, it needs to be adjusted to `k + 1` to allow the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` and `j` are integers**
