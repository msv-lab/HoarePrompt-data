Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers where `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to the current value.***
