Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k + 1` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes occur in the variables. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the if else block.***
