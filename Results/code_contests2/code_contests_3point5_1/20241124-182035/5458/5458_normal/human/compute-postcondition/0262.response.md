Output State: **`j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` and `k` are dependent on the specific conditions within the loop for updating the `dp` array. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and the loop continues. All other variables remain unchanged.**
