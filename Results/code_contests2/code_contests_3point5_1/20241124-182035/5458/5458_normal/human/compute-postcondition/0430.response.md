According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the initial value, and `k` has been incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
1. Increment `k` by 1.
2. Check if `i == 0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, if true then set `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1.
3. If `i > 0` and `j > k`, update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
4. In all other cases, increment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the initial value, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `s`.**
