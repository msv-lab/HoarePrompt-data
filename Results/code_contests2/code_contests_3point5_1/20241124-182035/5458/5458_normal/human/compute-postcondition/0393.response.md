Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s - 1`, `dp` is updated according to the given equation. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
