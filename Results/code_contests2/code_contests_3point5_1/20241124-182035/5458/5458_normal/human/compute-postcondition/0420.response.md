Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the initial value, `k` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program execution.***
