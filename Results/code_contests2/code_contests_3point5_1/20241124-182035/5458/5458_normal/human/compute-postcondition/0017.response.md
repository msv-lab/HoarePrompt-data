Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m, s` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) by (s + 1), `i` is not 0, `j` is within the range 1 to `m`, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
