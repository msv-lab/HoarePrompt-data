Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 2, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j+1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
