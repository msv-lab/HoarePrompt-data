Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`**
