Example Answer:
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions `(m + 2)` by `(s + 1)` and initialized with zeros. The previous values of `m` and `s` are known, so the dimensions of `dp` are `(m + 2)` by `(s + 1)`. The previous value of `n` is unknown, but it does not affect the dimensions of `dp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n, m, s` are integers, and a 2D list `dp` is created and initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` by `(s + 1)`.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n, m, s` are integers, a 2D list `dp` is created and initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` by `(s + 1)`**
