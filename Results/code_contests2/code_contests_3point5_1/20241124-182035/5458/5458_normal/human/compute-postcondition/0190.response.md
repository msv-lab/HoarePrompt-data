Postcondition: ***`dp` values are adjusted, `s` is at least 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This ensures that the state of `dp` is maintained properly.***
