According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 1, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j+1][k]` is set to 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 2, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j+1][k]` is set to 1**
