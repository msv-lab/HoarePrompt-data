Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 3, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the comparison between `j` and `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.**
