Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m, s, i, j are integers, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) by (s + 1), k is adjusted to the next value after the last iteration. If j is greater than or equal to k, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to 1. All variables retain their initial conditions and the program state is consistent even after the execution of the if statement, covering all possible edge cases***
