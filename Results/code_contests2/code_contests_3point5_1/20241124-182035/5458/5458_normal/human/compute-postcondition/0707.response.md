Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1` are integers with values 1, `i` remains the same, `j` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
