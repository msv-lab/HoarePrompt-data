Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1` and `k` are integers, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. For all other cases, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` remain unchanged after the execution of the program fragment.***
