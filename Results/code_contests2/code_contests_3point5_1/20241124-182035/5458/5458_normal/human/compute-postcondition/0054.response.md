Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m, s is at least 1, i, j + 1, k is 1, dp is a 2D list with updated values based on the specified conditions for the next iteration. If i is equal to 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is not equal to 0 and j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If j is not greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated first with the modulo operation of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and then added with the modulo operation of dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. All edge cases are handled, maintaining the consistency of the program state with the specified conditions after the execution of the if else block.***
