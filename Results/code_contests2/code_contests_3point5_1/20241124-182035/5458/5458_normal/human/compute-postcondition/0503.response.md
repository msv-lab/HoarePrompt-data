According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Furthermore, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is at least 1**
