Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, so the output state is: `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` and `k` are dependent on specific conditions within the loop for updating the `dp` array, `k` is less than `s`, the next value of `k` is `k + 1.
Output State: **`j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` and `k` are dependent on specific conditions within the loop for updating the `dp` array, `k` is less than `s`, the next value of `k` is `k + 1**
