Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. The value of `k` is between 1 and `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is between 1 and `s`, all other states remain the same.
Output State: **`k` is between 1 and `s`, all other states remain the same**
