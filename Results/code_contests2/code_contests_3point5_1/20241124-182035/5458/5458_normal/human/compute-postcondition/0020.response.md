Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m, s, i, j, k` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` by `(s + 1)`. `i` is either 0 or not 0. If `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The program variables maintain their relationships and values specified in the initial state, and all possible edge cases are covered in the postcondition.***
