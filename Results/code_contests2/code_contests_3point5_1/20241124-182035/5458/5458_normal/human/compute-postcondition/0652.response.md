According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0. To ensure the loop executes, `n` should be greater than 0. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, and `s` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `s` is 0**
