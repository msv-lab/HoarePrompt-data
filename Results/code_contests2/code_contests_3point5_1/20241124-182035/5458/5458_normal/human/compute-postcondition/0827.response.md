According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, the loop will execute `s` times. Before the loop starts, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `k` should be 1, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
