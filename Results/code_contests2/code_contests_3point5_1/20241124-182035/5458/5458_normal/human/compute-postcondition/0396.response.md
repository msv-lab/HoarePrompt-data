According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` equals `s - 1`. Since `k` is equal to `s - 1`, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `s`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` equals `s`.**
