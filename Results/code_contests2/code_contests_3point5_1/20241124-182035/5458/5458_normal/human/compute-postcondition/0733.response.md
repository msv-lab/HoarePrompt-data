Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The previous values of the variables are not provided, so the output state is: `i` is 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula**
