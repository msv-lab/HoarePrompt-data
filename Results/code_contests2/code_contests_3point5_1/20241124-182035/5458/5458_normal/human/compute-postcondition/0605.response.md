Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
