Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The postcondition ensures that the values of the variables are maintained, except for the modification of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1 based on the condition `j >= k`.***
