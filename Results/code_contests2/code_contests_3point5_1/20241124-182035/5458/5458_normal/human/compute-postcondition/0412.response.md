According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is incremented based on the loop, `k` is 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
- Increment `k` by 1 to move to the next iteration.
- Reset `j` to its initial value since it is incremented based on the loop.
- Update the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the conditions specified in the code snippet.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the initial value, `k` is incremented by 1**.
