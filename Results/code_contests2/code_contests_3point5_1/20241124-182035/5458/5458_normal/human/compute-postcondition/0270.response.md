Postcondition: ***`j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` and `k` are updated according to specific conditions within the loop for updating the `dp` array. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases, where `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` retain their values as per the precondition and are updated accordingly within the if-else block. `k` remains less than `s`.***
