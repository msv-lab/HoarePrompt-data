Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers where `j` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod plus dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
