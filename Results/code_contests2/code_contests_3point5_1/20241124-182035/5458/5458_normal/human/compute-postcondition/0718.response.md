Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers with values 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula provided. The dp array values at specific indices are modified according to the conditions met during the execution.***
