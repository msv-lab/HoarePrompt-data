According to the code, the loop will execute `s` times, and `j` will be incremented in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, if `n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` and `s` are at least 1, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on conditions.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Increase the value of `j` by 1.
2. If the conditions mentioned in the loop code are met, update the values in `dp` accordingly based on the conditions specified in the loop code.
3. Ensure that `n` is greater than 0, `mod` remains 100000, `m` and `s` are at least 1, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, and the conditions for updating `dp` are followed.

State: **If `n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` and `s` are at least 1, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on conditions**.
