Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer, `k` is set to `s + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list updated based on loop conditions. If `j` is greater than `k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is assigned the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The loop continues without any changes. This encompasses all possible scenarios and edge cases for the given program fragment.***
