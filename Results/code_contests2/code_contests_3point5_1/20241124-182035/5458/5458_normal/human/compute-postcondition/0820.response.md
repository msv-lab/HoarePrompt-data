Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers where `j` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the program continues. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
