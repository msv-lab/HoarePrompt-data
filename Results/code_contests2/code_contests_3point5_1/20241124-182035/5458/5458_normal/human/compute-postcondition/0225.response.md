Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `i` is not changed, the value of `j` remains greater than `k`, and `k` is between 1 and `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is between 1 and `s`, all other states remain the same. The value of i is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`k` is between 1 and `s`, all other states remain the same. The value of i is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`**
