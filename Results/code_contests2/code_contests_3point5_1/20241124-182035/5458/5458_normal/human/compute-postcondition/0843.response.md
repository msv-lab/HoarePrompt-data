Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known to be 1, an integer greater than 1, and 1 respectively. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
