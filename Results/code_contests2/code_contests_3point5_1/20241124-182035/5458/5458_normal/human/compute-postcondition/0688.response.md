According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `k`, `i` remain the same, `j` incremented by 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is now 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is 1, `i` remain the same, `j` incremented by 1**
