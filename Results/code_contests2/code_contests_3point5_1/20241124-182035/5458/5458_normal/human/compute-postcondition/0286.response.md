According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `m`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, and `k` is less than or equal to `m` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, and `k` is now 1.
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
