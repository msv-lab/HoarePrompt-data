According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `s` and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `s` is equal to or greater than `m`.  So for the loop to execute one more time, `s` should still be greater than or equal to 1, and `k` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`**
