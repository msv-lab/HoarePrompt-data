Output State: If `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 1, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, and `i` equals 0 with `j` greater than or equal to `k`, then after the loop executes:
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
If the conditions are not met, the loop will not execute and the values of the variables will remain the same as the initial state.
