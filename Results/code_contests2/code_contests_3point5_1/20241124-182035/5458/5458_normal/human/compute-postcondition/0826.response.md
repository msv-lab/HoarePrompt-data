According to the code, the loop can execute if `m` is greater than or equal to 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers where `j` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s`.

If the loop is to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, so `s` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 1.
- No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`**
