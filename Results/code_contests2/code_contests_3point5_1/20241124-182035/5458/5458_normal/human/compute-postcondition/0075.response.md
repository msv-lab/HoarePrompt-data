According to the code, the loop will execute at least once based on the conditions. After each iteration, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] should be set to 1.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] should be updated with the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].
- If `j` is not greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] should be updated first with the modulo operation of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and then added with the modulo operation of dp[i & 1][j][k - j].

Based on the above conditions, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **If `n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on conditions.**
