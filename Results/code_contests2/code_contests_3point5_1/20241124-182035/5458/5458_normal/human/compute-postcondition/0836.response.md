Postcondition: ***`i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The overall state of the program after the if-else block execution covers the cases where `j` is greater than `k` and the assignment has occurred, ensuring the validity of the postcondition.***
