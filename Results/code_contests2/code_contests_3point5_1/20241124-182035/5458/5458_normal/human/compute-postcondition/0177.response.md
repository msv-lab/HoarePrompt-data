Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, incorporating the modulo operation where necessary.***
