Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k + 1` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][(k + 1)]` is set to 1. For all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][(k + 1)]` is affected based on the conditions specified in the code. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `s` under all circumstances.***
