Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer, `k` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list updated based on loop conditions. If `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then the entry `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. All other variables retain their initial values and relationships.***
