According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are all at least 1, `k` has been incremented by 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to continue the loop.
- All other states remain the same as they meet the requirements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are all at least 1, `k` has been incremented by 3**
