Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated to the modulo value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` depends on the initial values of the variables which are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`**
