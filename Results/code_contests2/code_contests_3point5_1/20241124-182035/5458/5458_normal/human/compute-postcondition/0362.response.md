According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is incremented by 1 and `k` is less than or equal to `s+1. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `k`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers initialized to 1, `k` is incremented by 2, `k` is less than or equal to `s+1`**
