Output State: 
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. 
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
- The loop will execute at least once if `s` is at least 1. If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute.
- `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is incremented based on the loop.
