According to the code, the loop can execute if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. Since `k` is incremented in the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2**
