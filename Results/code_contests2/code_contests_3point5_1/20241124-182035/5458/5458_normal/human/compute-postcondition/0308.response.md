According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `k` is 2 and less than or equal to `s`, the loop will execute again. Therefore, no changes need to be made to the variables `i`, `j`, and `s`. The only change needed is to increment `k` by 1.
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
