According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s`. Since `k` should be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k` is equal to `s - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s - 1**
