Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000. `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are less than or equal to `m`. `k` ranges from 1 to `s+2` inclusive. After the if-else block executes, the `dp` array is updated based on the conditions:
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. All other arrays and variables remain unchanged after the execution.***
