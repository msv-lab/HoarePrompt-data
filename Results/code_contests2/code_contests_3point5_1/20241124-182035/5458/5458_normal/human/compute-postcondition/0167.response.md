Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. The initial values of i, j, k, m, and s are given but not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the specific calculation cannot be determined. The output state is: i is 0, j is less than m, k ranges from 1 to s + 1, and the dp array values have been updated according to the given formula.
Output State: **i is 0, j is less than m, k ranges from 1 to s + 1, and the dp array values have been updated according to the given formula**
