Output State: **`i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and is then assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The calculation involves adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.**
