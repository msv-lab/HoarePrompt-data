Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `k`, `s` are integers. Initially, `i` is 0, `j` equals `m`, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. After the execution of the if-else block, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. In all other cases, there is no change in the values of the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s`.***
