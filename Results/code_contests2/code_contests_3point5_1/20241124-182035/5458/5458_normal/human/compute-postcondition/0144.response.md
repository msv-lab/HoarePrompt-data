According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is set to `s + 1`, which means that the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` should be less than `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer, `k` is set to `s`, and `dp` is a 2D list updated based on loop conditions**
