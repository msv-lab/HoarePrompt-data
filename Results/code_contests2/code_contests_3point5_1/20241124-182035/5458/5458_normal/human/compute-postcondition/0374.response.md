Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues execution. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables involved in the fragment.***
