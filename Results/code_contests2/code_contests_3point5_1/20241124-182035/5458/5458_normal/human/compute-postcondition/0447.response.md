Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo operation result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The values of `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all at least 1, and the updated `dp` values based on the given calculation.
Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all at least 1, and the updated `dp` values based on the given calculation**
