According to the code, the loop will execute if `s` is at least 1. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `s + 1`, it means `s` needs to be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is 1.
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
