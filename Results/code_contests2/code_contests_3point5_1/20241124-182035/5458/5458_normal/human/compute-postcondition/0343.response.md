Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers initialized to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the specified element in the 2D list `dp` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the element is updated by the value of the element in the previous row. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the element is updated by taking the modulo of the value in the previous row with `mod` and adding the modulo of the value in the previous row at a different index with `mod`.***
