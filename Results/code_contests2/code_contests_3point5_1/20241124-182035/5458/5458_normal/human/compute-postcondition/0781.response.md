According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k` is 3.
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 3**
