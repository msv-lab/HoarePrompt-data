Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i, j, k` remain the same as their initial values. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the initial value, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `s.
Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the initial value, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `s**
