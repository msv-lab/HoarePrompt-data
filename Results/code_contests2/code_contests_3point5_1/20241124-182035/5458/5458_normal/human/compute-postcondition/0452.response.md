Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: mod remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are all at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **mod remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are all at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1**
