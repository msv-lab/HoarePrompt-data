Output State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers. If `j > k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. `k` is incremented by 1 in both cases. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios regarding the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` after the execution of the if statement.**
