Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `s` is at least 1, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` is 3, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the specified conditions. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and the loop continues. This condition covers all possible edge cases and ensures the integrity of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block.***
