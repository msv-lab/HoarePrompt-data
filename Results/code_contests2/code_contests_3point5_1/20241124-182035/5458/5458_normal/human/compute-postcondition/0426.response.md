Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the initial value, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. This ensures that the program updates the values in `dp` based on the condition `j > k` while maintaining the initial state of the variables.***
