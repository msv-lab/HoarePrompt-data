According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0 ensures the loop will execute, but `m` must be adjusted to be at least 1. Also, since `s` is not used in the loop, it does not need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is 0**
