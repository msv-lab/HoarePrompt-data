According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` values are adjusted, `s` is at least 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp` values are adjusted, `s` is at least 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, `k` is less than or equal to `s`**
