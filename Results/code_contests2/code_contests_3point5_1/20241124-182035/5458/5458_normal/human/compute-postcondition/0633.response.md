Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is at least 3, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`, `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. The postcondition covers all possible edge cases where `s`, `k`, `m`, `i`, and `j` meet the specified conditions, ensuring that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is correctly updated to 1 when `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
