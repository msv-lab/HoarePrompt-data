Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues. In all other cases, there are no changes to the variables or the program state.***
