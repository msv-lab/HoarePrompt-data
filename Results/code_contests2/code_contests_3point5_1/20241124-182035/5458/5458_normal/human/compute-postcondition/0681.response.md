Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
