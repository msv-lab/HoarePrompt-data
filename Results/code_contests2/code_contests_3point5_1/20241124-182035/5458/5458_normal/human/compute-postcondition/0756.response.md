Output State: 
- `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers. 
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. 
- If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 
- If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is first updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

- The loop will execute at least once if `s` is greater than 0. 
- If `s` is equal to 0 or less, the loop will not execute.
- If `m` is less than `j`, the loop will not execute.
- If `j` is greater than `s`, the loop will not execute.

- If the loop does not execute, all variables remain the same as in the initial state.
