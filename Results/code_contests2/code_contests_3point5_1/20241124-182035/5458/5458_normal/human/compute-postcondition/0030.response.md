According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has been adjusted to the next value after the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be updated to the next value after the current value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) by (s + 1), `k` is adjusted to the next value after the current value**
