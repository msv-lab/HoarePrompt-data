Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, but we know that `k` is between 2 and `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is between 2 and `s`, `dp` array is updated with the new value.
Output State: **`k` is between 2 and `s`, `dp` array is updated with the new value**
