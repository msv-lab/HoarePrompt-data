Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, mod is 100000, m is at least 1, s is at least 1, i is 0, j is 1, k is 1, program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m + 2) by (s + 1), if j is greater than or equal to k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. All other variables retain their initial values.***
