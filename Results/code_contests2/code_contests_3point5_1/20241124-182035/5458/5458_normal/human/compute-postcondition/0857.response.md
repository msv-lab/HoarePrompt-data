Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` added to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged after the execution of the program fragment.***
