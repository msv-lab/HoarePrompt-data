Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `s` is at least 1, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` is 3, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1, otherwise, dp remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the element at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], else it is updated to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod plus the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
