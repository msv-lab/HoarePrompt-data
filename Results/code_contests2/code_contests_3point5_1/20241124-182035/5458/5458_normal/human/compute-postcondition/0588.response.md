According to the code, the loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and `k` still needs to be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `s` is equal to or greater than `m**`.
