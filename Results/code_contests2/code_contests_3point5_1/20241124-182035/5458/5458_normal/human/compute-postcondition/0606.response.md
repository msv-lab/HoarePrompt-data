According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`. To execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to 4 since it is currently 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 4, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`**
