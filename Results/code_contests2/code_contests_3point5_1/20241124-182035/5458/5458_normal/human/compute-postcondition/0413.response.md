Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, the initial value, and incremented by 1 respectively. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the initial value, `k` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the initial value, `k` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
