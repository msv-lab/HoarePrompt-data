Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the initial value, `k` is incremented by 1. After the if statement executes, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. All variables retain their initial conditions and relationships, with the specific assignment occurring only if `j` is greater than `k`. No other changes occur to the variables.***
