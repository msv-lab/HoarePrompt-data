According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0 and `m` is at least 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is at least 1 and `k` is 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
