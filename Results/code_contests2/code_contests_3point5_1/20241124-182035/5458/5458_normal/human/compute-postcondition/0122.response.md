Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list updated based on loop conditions. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program state remains consistent with the initial conditions after executing the if statement, handling all possible edge cases.***
