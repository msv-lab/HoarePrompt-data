Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1` remain the same. `i` remains the same, and `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1` are integers with values 1, `i` remains the same, `j` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1` are integers with values 1, `i` remains the same, `j` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
