Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 1, a value greater than 1, and 1 respectively. The output state is: `i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
