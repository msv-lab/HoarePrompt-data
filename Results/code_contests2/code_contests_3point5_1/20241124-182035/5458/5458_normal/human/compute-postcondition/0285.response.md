According to the code, the loop will execute at least once if `j` is less than or equal to `m` and `s` is greater than 0. After the loop executes, the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` will be updated based on specific conditions within the loop. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the `dp` array at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1. In all other cases, where `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be determined based on specific conditions within the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, if the loop has executed at least once, `j` is less than or equal to `m` and `s` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, and `k` is less than or equal to `m`.**
