Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Furthermore, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then the loop does not execute and the values of the variables remain the same.**
