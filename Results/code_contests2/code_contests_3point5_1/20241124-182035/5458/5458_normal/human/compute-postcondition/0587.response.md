Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In all other cases where `i` is not 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values as described in the code fragment. The postcondition covers all possible combinations of values for `s`, `k`, `m`, `i`, and `j`, ensuring the correct behavior of the program.***
