At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` and `k` are dependent on specific conditions within the loop, `k` is less than `s`. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `s`, the next value of `k` should be `k + 1` to continue the iteration.
State: **`j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` and `k` are dependent on specific conditions within the loop for updating the `dp` array, `k` is less than `s`, the next value of `k` is `k + 1**`.
