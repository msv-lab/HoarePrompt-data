Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m, s, i, j, k` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` by `(s + 1)`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and continue. The program maintains the initial conditions and correctly handles the case where `j` is greater than `k`, ensuring the proper update of the 2D list `dp`.***
