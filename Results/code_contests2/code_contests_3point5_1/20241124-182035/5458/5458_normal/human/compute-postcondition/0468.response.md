Output State: `mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k` in the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. No changes occur to `m`, `s`, `mod` in the execution of the program. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute.
