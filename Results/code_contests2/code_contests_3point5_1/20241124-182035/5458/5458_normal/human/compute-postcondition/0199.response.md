Postcondition: ***`dp` values are adjusted. `s` is at least 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, `k` is less than or equal to `s+1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues with the next iteration or block of code.***
