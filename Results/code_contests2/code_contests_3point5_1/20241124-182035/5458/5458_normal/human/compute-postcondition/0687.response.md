According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is first updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state of variables should be adjusted accordingly:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` remain the same, `j` incremented by 1**
