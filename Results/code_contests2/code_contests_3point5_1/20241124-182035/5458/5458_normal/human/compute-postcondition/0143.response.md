Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer, `k` is set to `s + 1`, and `dp` is a 2D list updated based on loop conditions. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the 2D list `dp` is set to 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is determined as follows: if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, else `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases for the given program fragment.***
