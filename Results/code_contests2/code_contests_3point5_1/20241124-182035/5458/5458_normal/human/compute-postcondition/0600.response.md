Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly defined in the given code snippet, so their impact cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is equal to or greater than `m`**
