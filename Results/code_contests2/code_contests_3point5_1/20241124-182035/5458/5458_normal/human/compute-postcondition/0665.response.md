Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration or statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
