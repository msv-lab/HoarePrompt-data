According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers initialized to 1, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the division of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` mod `mod`. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `s+1`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers initialized to 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s+1**
