Postcondition: ***`j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` and `k` are dependent on specific conditions within the loop for updating the `dp` array, `k` is less than `s`, and the next value of `k` is `k + 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k` and `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
