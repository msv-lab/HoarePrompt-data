Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1` are all at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues without any change in state. Otherwise, there are no modifications to the variables.***
