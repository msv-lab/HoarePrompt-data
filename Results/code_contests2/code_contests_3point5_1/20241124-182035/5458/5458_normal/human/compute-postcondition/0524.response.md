Output State: **`mod` remains 100000. `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are less than or equal to `m`. `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1` inclusive. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.**
