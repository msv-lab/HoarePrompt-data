Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `i` can be either 0 or 1, the value of `j` is an integer greater than 1, and the value of `k` is 1. Since the value of `j` is greater than `k`, the assignment takes place without changing the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has taken place.
Output State: **`i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has taken place**
