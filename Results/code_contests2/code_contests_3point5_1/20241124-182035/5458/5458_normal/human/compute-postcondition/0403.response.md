Postcondition: ***s is at least 1, mod remains 100000, m remains at least 1, i is 0, j is incremented based on the loop, k is 1, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. The program state remains the same after the execution of the if statement, with the specified variables retaining their initial conditions and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] being set to 1 when j is greater than or equal to k.***
