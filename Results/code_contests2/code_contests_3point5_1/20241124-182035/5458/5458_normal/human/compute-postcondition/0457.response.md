Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1. After the execution of the if statement, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo of the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`.***
