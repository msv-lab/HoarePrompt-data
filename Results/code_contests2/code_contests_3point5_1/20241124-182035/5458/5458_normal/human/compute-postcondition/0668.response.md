Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` and `j` are integers, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` and `j` are integers, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
