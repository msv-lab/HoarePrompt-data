Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m, s is at least 1, i, j + 1, k is 2, dp is a 2D list with updated values based on the specified conditions. If j > k, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues. All other states remain the same as stated in the precondition.***
