Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers where `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index `[1][m + 1][2]` in the dp list is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and the dp list.***
