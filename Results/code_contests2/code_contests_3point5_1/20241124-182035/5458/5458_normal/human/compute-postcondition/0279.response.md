Postcondition: ***`j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` and `k` are dependent on specific conditions within the loop for updating the `dp` array, `k` is less than `s`, and the next value of `k` is `k + 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. Otherwise, there is no change in the `dp` array.***
