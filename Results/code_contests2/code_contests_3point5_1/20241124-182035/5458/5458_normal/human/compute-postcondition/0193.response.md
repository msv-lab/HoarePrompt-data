Postcondition: ***`dp` values are adjusted, `s` is at least 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of dividing the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`, and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
