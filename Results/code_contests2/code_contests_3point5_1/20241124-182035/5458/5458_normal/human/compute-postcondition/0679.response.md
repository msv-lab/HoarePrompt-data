Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` all being 0 and `j` being greater than or equal to 2. Since the assignment does not change the values of the variables, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` are 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` are 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2**
