According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are at least 1, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `k` is incremented by 1, then for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are at least 1, `k` is `k + 1**
