Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
