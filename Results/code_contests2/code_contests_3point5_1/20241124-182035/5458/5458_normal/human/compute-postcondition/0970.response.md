Since the `while` loop is `while 1`, it will run indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement within the loop body. Therefore, the states `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged and the loop will execute one more time with the same states.
State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged**
