Postcondition: ***`n`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `dp`, `k` are as specified. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while ensuring that all variables maintain their original conditions as described in the precondition.***
