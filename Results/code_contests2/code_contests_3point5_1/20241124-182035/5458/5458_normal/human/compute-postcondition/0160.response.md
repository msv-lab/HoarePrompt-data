According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is equal to `s`. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `m`, and `k` needs to be incremented by 1 while ensuring it is still less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1**.
