Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values in the dp array. The final value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` accurately reflects the calculated results taking into account all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
