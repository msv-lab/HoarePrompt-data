Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at the previous index. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the modulo value of the previous index and further incremented by the modulo value at a specific index based on `k` and `j`. All variables maintain their initial constraints and values.***
