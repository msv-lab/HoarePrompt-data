Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
