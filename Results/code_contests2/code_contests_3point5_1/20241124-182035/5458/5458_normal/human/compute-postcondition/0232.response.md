Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since no other variables are mentioned, their values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is between 2 and `s`, all other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`k` is between 2 and `s`, all other variables remain the same**
