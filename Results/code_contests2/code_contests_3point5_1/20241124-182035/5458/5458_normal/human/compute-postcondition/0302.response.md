Example Answer: 
The value at index `i + 1 & 1` and indexes `j + 1` and `k` in the `dp` array is assigned the value at index `i + 1 & 1`, index `j`, and index `k` in the `dp` array. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` have specific initial values, and the assignment does not change their values. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
