Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1 + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` are integers, where `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1 + 1` (updated value).
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` are integers, where `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1 + 1` (updated value)**
