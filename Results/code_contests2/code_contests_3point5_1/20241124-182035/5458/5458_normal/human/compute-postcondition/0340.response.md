Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mod` is 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` by `(s + 1)`, `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned the integer values entered by the user, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. The overall state of the program maintains the initial conditions and updates the specified element in the 2D list according to the condition.***
