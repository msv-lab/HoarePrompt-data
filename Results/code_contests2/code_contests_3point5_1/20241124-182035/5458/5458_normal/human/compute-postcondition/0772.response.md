According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. The conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are based on the values of `j` and `k`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `k` should be considered. Since `k` is currently at 1 and it should be incremented by 1 within the range of 1 to `s`, the next value of `k` should be 2.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2**
