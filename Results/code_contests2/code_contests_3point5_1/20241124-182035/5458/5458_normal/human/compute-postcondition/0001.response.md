Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values from the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since the initial state of `mod` is 100000, it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: mod is 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values from user input.
Output State: **mod is 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values from user input**
