Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are all at least 1, `k` has been incremented by 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `j` is not equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
