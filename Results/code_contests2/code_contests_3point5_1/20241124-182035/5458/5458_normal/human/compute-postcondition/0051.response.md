Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m, s is at least 1, i, j + 1, k is 1, dp is a 2D list with updated values based on the specified conditions for the next iteration, i is not equal to 0. If j is greater than k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The program continues without any changes to other variables.***
