Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. After execution, the state remains the same as the assignment does not change the values of the variables.
Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2**
