According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then added to the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` and adjusted accordingly. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then added to the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. `k` is less than or equal to `s`.**
