Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to 2, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as the modulo of the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and then incremented by the modulo of the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. The program state is updated accordingly to these conditions after the if-else block executes.***
