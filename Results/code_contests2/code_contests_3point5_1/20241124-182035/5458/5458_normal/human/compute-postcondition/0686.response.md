Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is first updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This covers all possible scenarios and the final state of the program variables.**
