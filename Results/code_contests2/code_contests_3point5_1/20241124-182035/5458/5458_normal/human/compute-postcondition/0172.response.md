Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known to be 0, less than `m`, and the next value within the range of 1 to `s + 1` respectively. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
