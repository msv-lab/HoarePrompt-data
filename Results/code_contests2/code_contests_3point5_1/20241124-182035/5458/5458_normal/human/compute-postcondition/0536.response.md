Output State: 
- `mod` remains 100000
- `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are less than or equal to `m`
- `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive
- If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1
- If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`
- If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j <= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.

The loop will not execute if `s` is less than 1, as the range for `k` will not be valid. In such a case, all variables remain unchanged.
