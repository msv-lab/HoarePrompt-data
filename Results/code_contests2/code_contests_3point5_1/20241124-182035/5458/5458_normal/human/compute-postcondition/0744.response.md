According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` was incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `s + 1` in the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. `k` is then incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 and `k` is incremented by 1. `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**
