According to the code, the loop will execute at least once if `s` is at least 1. If `s` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then added to the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the conditions for the loop to continue must be met. 

If `s` is at least 1, the loop will continue. So, the only state that needs adjustment to ensure the loop executes one more time is the value of `s`. 
State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, `k` are integers**
