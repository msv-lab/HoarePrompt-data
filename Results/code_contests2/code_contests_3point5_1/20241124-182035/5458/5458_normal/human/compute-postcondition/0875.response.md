Example Answer:
If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of the variables are updated accordingly based on the conditions. 
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers, updated values based on the code execution**
