Example Answer: 
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 0, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
