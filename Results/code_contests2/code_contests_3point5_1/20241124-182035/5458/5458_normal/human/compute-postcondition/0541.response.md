According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `mod` remains 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is incremented based on the loop range. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1.
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
