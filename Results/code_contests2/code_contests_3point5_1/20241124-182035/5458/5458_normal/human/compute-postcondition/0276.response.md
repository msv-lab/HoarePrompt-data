Postcondition: ***`j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` and `k` are dependent on specific conditions within the loop for updating the `dp` array, `k` is less than `s`, the next value of `k` is `k + 1. After the if statement executes, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
