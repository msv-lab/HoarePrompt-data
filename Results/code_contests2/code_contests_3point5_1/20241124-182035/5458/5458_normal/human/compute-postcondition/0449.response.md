According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range from 1 to `s` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all at least 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `k` is the iterating variable in the for loop and it ranges from 1 to `s`, the next value of `k` needs to be considered. So, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`mod` remains 100000, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are all at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1.**
