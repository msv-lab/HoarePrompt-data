Output State: **`mod` remains 100000. `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are less than or equal to `m`. `k` ranges from 1 to `s+2` inclusive. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After executing the code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.**
