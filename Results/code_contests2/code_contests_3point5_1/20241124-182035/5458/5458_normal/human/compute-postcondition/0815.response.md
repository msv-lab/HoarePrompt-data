According to the code fragment, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers where `j` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1.
- If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
- Otherwise, no changes are needed for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers where `j` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2**.
