Postcondition: ***`i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and then incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. The postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios arising from the if-else block.***
