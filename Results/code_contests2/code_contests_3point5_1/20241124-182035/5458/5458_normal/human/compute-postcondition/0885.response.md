Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. For all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and then augmented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The variable `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `s` under all circumstances.***
