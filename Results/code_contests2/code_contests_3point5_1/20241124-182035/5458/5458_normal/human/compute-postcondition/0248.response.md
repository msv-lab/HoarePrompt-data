Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and `s`, `dp` array is updated based on the conditions mentioned above. If i is equal to 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. Otherwise, if i is not 0 and j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If j is not greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the modulo of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. This postcondition handles all possible scenarios and edge cases for the given program fragment.***
