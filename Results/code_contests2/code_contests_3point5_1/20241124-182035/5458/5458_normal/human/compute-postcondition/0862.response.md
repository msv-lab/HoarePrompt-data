According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` ranges from 0 to `n ** 2 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop executed successfully, so we need to adjust the values to ensure the loop executes one more time.

In this case, since `i` can be either 0 or 1, and `n` is not specified in the previous state, we need to consider the next possible values for `i` and adjust other variables accordingly. We also need to ensure that `s` remains greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 1**
