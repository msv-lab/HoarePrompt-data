Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, `s + 1`, and `k` remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is either 0 or any other value. `j` is any value greater than or equal to 1. `m` is any value. `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.***
