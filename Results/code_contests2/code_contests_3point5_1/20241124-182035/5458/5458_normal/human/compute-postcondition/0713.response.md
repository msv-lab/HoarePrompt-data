Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is also not affected. The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers with values 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers with values 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1**
