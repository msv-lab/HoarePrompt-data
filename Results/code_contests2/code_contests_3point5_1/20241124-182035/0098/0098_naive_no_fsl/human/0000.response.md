Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program calculates and prints the minimum length of a side of the square in which a 2n-gon can be embedded as described in the problem statement. The formula used to calculate the minimum length of a side of the square is mathematically correct. The program iterates through the test cases and computes the result for each case accurately. Additionally, the program handles the input constraints specified in the problem description. Overall, the program is correct and produces the expected output for all potential cases.
