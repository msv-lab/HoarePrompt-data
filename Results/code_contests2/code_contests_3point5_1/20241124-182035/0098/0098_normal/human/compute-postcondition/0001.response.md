The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199. The program returns the result of a mathematical expression involving cosine and sine functions based on the odd integer `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an odd integer `n` within the specified range and return the result of the mathematical expression involving cosine and sine functions based on `n`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts an odd integer n (3 <= n <= 199) and returns the result of a mathematical expression involving cosine and sine functions based on n.**
