Functionality: ** The function accepts an odd integer n (3 <= n <= 199) and calculates the result of a mathematical expression involving cosine and sine functions based on n. **

Note: The annotated code mentions that the function accepts an odd integer 'n' and returns the mathematical expression involving cosine and sine functions. However, it does not specify the range of 'n' as 3 <= n <= 199. Additionally, the import statement for the 'math' module is missing in the provided code snippet.
