Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes in the number of test cases and an odd integer n for each test case.
- It then calculates and prints the minimum length of a side of the square in which the 2n-gon can be embedded based on the given mathematical expression.
- The code follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the minimum side length of the square for each test case where n is an odd integer.
- There are no edge cases or scenarios provided in the problem description that would cause the code to deviate from the expected output, and the output hints also agree with the code's functionality.
