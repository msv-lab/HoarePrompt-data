Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program calculates the minimum length of a side of the square in which a 2n-gon can be embedded. It uses the formula `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` to calculate this length. The program takes input for the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it calculates and prints the result with 9 decimal places precision.

The formula used in the program is mathematically correct and provides the minimum length of the square side required to embed the 2n-gon. Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output for each test case, the correctness of the program is considered **True**.
