The function does not accept any parameters. It reads two space-separated values as input, converts them to integers, and performs a series of operations to calculate and print certain values based on permutations. The function iterates through a loop to calculate factorial values and print elements from a list while removing them. The functionality is to calculate and print certain values related to permutations of length n with a maximum value of m, where n and m are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ m ≤ n.
