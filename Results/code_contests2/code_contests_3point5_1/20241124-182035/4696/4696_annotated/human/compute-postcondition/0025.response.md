The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints provided. The function returns the maximum possible value of f(p) for permutations of length n with a maximum value of m. The parameters n and m are positive integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, and cntn represents the number of permutations of length n. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the maximum possible value of f(p) for the specified constraints on n and m. 
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It calculates and returns the maximum possible value of f(p) for permutations of length n with a maximum value of m, where n and m are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn.**
