Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `raw_input().split()`. The function `raw_input()` reads a line from input and `split()` splits the line into a list of strings. Since we don't have information about the input, the output state will be: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p); a and b are assigned values returned by input split.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p); a and b are assigned values returned by input split**
