Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is assigned the integer value of `b`, which is returned by the input split. The previous values of the affected variables are not mentioned. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned values returned by input split, `i` is an integer value of `b`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned values returned by input split, `i` is an integer value of `b`**
