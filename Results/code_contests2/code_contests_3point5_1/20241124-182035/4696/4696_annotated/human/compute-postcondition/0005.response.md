According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` from 1 to `n` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the initial state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned values returned by input split, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` contains integers from 1 to `n`, `k` is 1**
