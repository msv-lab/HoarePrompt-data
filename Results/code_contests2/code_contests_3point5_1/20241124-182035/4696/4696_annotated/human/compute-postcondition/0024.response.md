Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned values returned by input split, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` contains integers from 1 to `n` excluding the value at index `d`, `k` is the number of iterations, `f` is the factorial of (n - k), `d` is the integer division of `i` by `f`, and the loop prints and removes the value at index `d` from list `p`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute.**
