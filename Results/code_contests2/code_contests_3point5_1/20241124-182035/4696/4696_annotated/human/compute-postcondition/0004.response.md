Example Answer: 
`p` is assigned a range from 1 to `n`, inclusive. The previous values of `n` are known to be positive integers, so the range `p` will contain integers from 1 to `n`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned values returned by input split, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` contains integers from 1 to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned values returned by input split, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` contains integers from 1 to `n`**
