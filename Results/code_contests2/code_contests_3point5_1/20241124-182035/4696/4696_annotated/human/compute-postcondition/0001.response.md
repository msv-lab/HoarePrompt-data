Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(a)`, where `a` is a value returned by input split, so `n` becomes an integer. Other variables are not affected.  
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p); a and b are assigned values returned by input split**
