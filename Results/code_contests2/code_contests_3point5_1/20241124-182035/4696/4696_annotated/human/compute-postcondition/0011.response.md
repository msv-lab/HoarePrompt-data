According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned values returned by input split, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` contains integers from 1 to `n` excluding the value at index `d`, `k` is 2, `f` is the factorial of (n - 1), `d` is the integer division of `i` by `f`, and the output prints the value at index `d` of list `p`, `i = i % f` is executed.**
