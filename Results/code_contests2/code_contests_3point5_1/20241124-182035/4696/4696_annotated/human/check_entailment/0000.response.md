Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). It calculates the factorial of (n - k) and uses it to determine the index of the element to be printed and removed from the list. The loop iterates through all the elements in the permutation and prints them in the correct order.

Given the problem description and the provided annotations, there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
