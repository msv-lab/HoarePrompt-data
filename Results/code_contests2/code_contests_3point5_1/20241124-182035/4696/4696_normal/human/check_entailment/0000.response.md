Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly calculates the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). It follows the problem description as it reads two inputs as strings, converts them to integers, and then iterates through a loop n times to calculate factorials, divide values, and print elements from a list. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the output is correct for all valid inputs. The output hints also align with the code logic, confirming its correctness. Overall, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description and outputs the correct result for all cases.
