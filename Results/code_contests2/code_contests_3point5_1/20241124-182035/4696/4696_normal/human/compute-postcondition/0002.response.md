Example Answer: 
`i` is assigned the integer value of `b`. The previous value of `b` is unknown, so the output state is: n is assigned the integer value of a, m remains a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, a and b are the inputs split based on whitespace, i is assigned the integer value of b.
Output State: **n is assigned the integer value of a, m remains a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, a and b are the inputs split based on whitespace, i is assigned the integer value of b**
