According to the loop statement, the loop will iterate through values from 1 to n inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- n is greater than 0
- m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n
- a and b are the inputs split based on whitespace
- i is the integer value of b - 1 modulo the factorial of n - (n + 1)
- p is a range from 1 to n with p[d] removed
- k is n + 1
- f is the factorial of n - (n + 1)
- d is the result of i divided by f
- i is i modulo f

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Increase n by 1 as the loop iterates up to n inclusive
- Update k to n + 2 to prepare for the next iteration

State: **n is greater than 1, m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, a and b are the inputs split based on whitespace, i is the integer value of b - 1 modulo the factorial of n - (n + 1), p is a range from 1 to n with p[d] removed, k is n + 2, f is the factorial of n - (n + 1), d is the result of i divided by f, i is i modulo f**
