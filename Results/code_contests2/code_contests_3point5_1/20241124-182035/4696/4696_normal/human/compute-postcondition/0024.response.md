Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute n times. After each iteration, f is the factorial of n - k, d is i divided by f, and i is updated to i modulo f. The loop removes the element at index d from the list p and prints it. If n is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute.**
