Functionality: **The function reads two inputs as strings, converts them to integers, and then performs a series of calculations to determine the maximum possible value of f(p) based on constraints involving positive integers n and m. The function iterates through a loop n times, calculating factorials, dividing values, and printing elements from a list.**
