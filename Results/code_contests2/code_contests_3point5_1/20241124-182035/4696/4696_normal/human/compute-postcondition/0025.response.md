The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns the maximum possible value of f(p) where p is a permutation of length n and f(p) is calculated based on certain constraints involving positive integers n and m. The constraints state that n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the maximum possible value of f(p) based on the given constraints.
