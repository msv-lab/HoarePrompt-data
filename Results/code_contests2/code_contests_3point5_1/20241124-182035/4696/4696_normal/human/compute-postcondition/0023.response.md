According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `n`, so to execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **Dependent on the initial values of `i` and `f` after removing an element at index `d` from list `p`, `k` is equal to n + 1**
