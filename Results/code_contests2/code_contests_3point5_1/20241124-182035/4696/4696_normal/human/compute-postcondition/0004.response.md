Example Answer:
p is assigned the range from 1 to n+1. The previous values of the variables are: n is assigned the integer value of a, m remains a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, a and b are the inputs split based on whitespace, i is assigned the integer value of b - 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is assigned the integer value of a, m remains a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, a and b are the inputs split based on whitespace, i is assigned the integer value of b - 1, p is a range from 1 to n+1.
Output State: **n is assigned the integer value of a, m remains a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, a and b are the inputs split based on whitespace, i is assigned the integer value of b - 1, p is a range from 1 to n+1**
