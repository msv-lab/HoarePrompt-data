Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). The program calculates the permutation based on the given input values of n and m, and it correctly handles the removal of elements from the permutation list to find the desired result. The program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases within the specified constraints.
