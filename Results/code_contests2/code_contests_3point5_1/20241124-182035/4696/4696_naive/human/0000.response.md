Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly output the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). The issue lies in the line `(print(p[d]),)` which should be `print(p[d], end=' ')` to print the numbers with space separation as required by the problem description. 

For example, if the input is `2 2`, the expected output should be `2 1`, but the program will output `(2,) 1` which is incorrect.
