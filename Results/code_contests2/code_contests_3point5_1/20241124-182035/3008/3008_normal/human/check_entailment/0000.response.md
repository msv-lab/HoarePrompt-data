Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code attempts to perform arithmetic operations on a string input `n`, which will result in a TypeError. Additionally, the code does not accurately calculate the minimum number of subtractions needed to reduce the magic number to zero. The output hints also confirm that the code does not calculate the Fibonacci sequence as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
