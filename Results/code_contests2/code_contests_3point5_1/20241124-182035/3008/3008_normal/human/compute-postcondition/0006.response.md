The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based solely on its internal logic. The function calculates a sequence of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term, where n is a non-negative integer provided as input. The function then returns the list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to compute and return the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term, where n is a non-negative integer.
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term, where n is a non-negative integer.**
