Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The program simply calculates the minimum number of operations by dividing the input number by 10 and adding 1 if the number is not divisible by 10. This approach does not follow the rules of subtracting a digit from the number until it becomes zero.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide the minimum number of operations required to reduce the magic number to zero.
