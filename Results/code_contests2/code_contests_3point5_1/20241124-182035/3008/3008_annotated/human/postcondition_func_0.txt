The function `func` reads an input integer `n`, checks if it is divisible by 10, and then prints the result of 2 times the quotient of `n` divided by 10 added to 1 if `n` is not divisible by 10. However, the code does not handle the case where the input is not a valid integer, leading to a potential ValueError.
