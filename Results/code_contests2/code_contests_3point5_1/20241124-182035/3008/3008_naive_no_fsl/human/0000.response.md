Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to reduce the magic number to zero as described in the problem. It only considers the last digit of the input number, which is not sufficient to find the minimum number of operations. For example, if the input is 24, the program will output 2, while the correct answer is 5 (24 → 20 → 18 → 10 → 9 → 0). Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
