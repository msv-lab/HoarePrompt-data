Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input for the number of passengers and the top floor.
- It then reads the floor and time of arrival for each passenger and stores them in a list of tuples.
- The list of passengers is sorted based on the floor in descending order.
- The program simulates the elevator moving down the floors and picking up passengers as needed.
- It calculates the total time taken to bring all passengers to floor 0 and prints the result.

The program covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. Therefore, it is correct.
