Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values `n` and `s`, then iterates `n` times to read pairs of integers and store them in a list `p`. 
- It sorts the list `p` based on the first element of the tuples in descending order and appends a tuple (0, 0) to `p`.
- The code then calculates the `time_passed` based on the given conditions and prints the final value of `time_passed`.
- The code accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases, handling the scenario where passengers arrive at different floors and times, and calculating the minimum amount of time needed to bring all passengers to floor 0.
