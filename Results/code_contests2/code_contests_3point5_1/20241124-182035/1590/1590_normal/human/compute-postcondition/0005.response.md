According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 100, `s` is 1, `p` contains a tuple with the values of the first and second integer inputs, `fi` is assigned the first integer input, `ti` is assigned the second integer input. Since `n` is between 1 and 100, the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `s` is 1, `p` contains a tuple with the values of the first and second integer inputs, `fi` is assigned the first integer input, `ti` is assigned the second integer input**
