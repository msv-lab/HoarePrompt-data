According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 2 and 100, `s` is 1, `p` contains tuples with the values of the first and second integer inputs including the newly appended tuple, `fi` is assigned the first integer input, `ti` is assigned the second integer input. To execute the loop one more time, `n` should be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is between 3 and 101, `s` is 1, `p` contains tuples with the values of the first and second integer inputs including the newly appended tuple, `fi` is assigned the first integer input, `ti` is assigned the second integer input**
