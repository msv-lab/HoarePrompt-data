Postcondition: ***`p` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order with the newly appended tuple (0, 0), `n`, `s`, `fi`, and `ti` remain unchanged, `time_passed` is increased by the difference between `s` and the first element of tuple `p` at index `i`, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. The `time_passed` is less than the second element of tuple `p` at index `i`***
