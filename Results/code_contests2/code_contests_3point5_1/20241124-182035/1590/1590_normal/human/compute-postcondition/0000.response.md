Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the first integer value from the input split by space, and `s` is assigned the second integer value from the input split by space. The values of `n` and `s` are restricted within the given range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000**
