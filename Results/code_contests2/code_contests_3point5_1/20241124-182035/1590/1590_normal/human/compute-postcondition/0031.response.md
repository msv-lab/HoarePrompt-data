Postcondition: ***`p` remains as a sorted list of tuples in descending order with the newly appended tuple (0, 0), `n`, `s`, `fi`, and `ti` remain unchanged. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1] - time_passed`, `i` is increased by 1, `s` is updated to the first element of tuple `p` at index `i`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
