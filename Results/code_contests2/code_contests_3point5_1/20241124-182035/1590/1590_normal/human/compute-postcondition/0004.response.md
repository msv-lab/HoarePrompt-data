Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple containing the values of `fi` and `ti` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained from the first and second integer inputs respectively. The initial state indicates that `fi` and `ti` are assigned the first and second integer inputs. Therefore, after execution, the list `p` will contain a tuple with the values of the first and second integer inputs.
Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `s` is 1, `p` contains a tuple with the values of the first and second integer inputs, `fi` is assigned the first integer input, `ti` is assigned the second integer input**
