Postcondition: ***`p` remains as a sorted list of tuples in descending order with the newly appended tuple (0, 0). `n`, `s`, `fi`, and `ti` remain unchanged. `time_passed` is increased by the difference between `s` and the first element of tuple `p` at index `i`. `i` is increased by 1. `s` is updated to the first element of tuple `p` at index `i`. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is updated to be the sum of `time_passed` and the difference between `p[i][1]` and `time_passed`. This ensures that `time_passed` is adjusted to the correct value based on the current element of `p`.***
