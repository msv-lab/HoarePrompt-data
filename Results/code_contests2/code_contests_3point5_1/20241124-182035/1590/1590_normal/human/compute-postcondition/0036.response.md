Functionality: **The function func reads input values `n` and `s`, then iterates `n` times to read pairs of integers and store them in a list `p`. It sorts the list `p` based on the first element of the tuples in descending order, appends a tuple (0, 0) to `p`, and calculates `time_passed` based on the given conditions. The final value of `time_passed` is printed as output. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
