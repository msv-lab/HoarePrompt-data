According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 100. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` should be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `s` is 1, `p` contains a tuple with the values of the first and second integer inputs, `fi` is assigned the first integer input, `ti` is assigned the second integer input, and p appends a new tuple with the values of `fi` and `ti**`.
