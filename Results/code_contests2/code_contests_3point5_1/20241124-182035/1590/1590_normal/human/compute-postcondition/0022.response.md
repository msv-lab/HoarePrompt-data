According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order with the newly appended tuple (0, 0), `n`, `s`, `fi`, and `ti` remain unchanged, `time_passed` is increased by the difference between `s` and the first element of tuple `p` at index `i`, `i` is increased by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `i` is being increased by 1 for the next iteration, it should be adjusted to be one more than its current value.
- `n` is the upper limit for the range of the loop, so it should be greater than the current value to ensure the loop can execute again.
- No other states need to be adjusted.
