According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `p` is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `s` is now 1. 
State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `s` is 1, `p` is an empty list**
