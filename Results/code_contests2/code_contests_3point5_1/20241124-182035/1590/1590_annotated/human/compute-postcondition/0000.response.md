Example Answer: 
`n` and `s` are assigned values by mapping integers obtained from user input. The values of `n` and `s` are constrained by the given precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= s <= 1000.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= s <= 1000**
