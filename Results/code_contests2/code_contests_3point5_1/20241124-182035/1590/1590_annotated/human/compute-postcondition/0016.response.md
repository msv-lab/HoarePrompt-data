According to the code, the loop will execute n+1 times. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, the loop will use the variable i to iterate through the range. So before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted accordingly. 
State: **n is greater than or equal to 0, p is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on the first element, s is updated, fi is updated, ti is updated, i is 0, time_passed is 0**
