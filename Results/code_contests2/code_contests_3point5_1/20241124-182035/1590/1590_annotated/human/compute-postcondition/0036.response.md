Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `s`, `fi`, and `ti`. It then populates a list `p` with tuples of integers based on the input. The list `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of the tuples. It calculates the time passed based on certain conditions and prints the final time passed. The function does not have explicit return values. However, it processes the input data to calculate and output the time passed.**
