Postcondition: ***n is greater than or equal to 0, p is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on the first element. s is updated to the value of p[i][0], fi is updated, ti is updated, i is 0, time_passed is updated by s - p[0][0]. If time_passed is less than p[i][1], then time_passed is increased by the difference between p[i][1] and time_passed to ensure time_passed is at least p[i][1]***
