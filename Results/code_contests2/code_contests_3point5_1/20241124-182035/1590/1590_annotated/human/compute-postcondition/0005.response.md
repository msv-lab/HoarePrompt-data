According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer satisfying 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` contains a tuple with the first and second integer inputs, `i` is 0, `fi` is assigned the first integer input after splitting, `ti` is assigned the second integer input after splitting. Since `i` is 0, it needs to be adjusted to 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer satisfying 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` contains a tuple with the first and second integer inputs, `i` is 1, `fi` is assigned the first integer input after splitting, `ti` is assigned the second integer input after splitting**
