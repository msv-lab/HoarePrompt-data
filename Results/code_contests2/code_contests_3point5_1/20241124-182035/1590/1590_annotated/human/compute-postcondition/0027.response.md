Based on the provided code snippet, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

1. The value of `i` needs to be updated to 2 to move to the next iteration.
2. The value of `time_passed` needs to be updated to ensure it is at least `p[2][1]` to maintain chronological accuracy according to the sorted list of tuples in `p`.

State: **n is greater than or equal to 0, p is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on the first element, s is updated to the value of p[1][0], fi is updated, ti is updated, i is 2, time_passed is at least p[2][1]**
