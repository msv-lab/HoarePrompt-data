Example Answer:
A tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned the first and second integer inputs after splitting, respectively. The initial state of `p` is an empty list, so after execution, `p` will contain a tuple with the first and second integer inputs. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer satisfying 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` contains a tuple with the first and second integer inputs, `i` is 0, `fi` is assigned the first integer input after splitting, `ti` is assigned the second integer input after splitting**
