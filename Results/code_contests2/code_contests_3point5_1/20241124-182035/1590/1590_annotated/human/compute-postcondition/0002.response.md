According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `p` is an empty list. To ensure the loop executes, `n` should be greater than 0 and `i` should be 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer satisfying 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
