According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer satisfying 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` contains a tuple with the first and second integer inputs, `i` is 1, `fi` is assigned the first integer input after splitting, `ti` is assigned the second integer input after splitting, and a new tuple consisting of `(fi, ti)` is appended to `p`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer satisfying 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` contains a tuple with the first and second integer inputs, `i` is 2, `fi` is assigned the first integer input after splitting, `ti` is assigned the second integer input after splitting, and a new tuple consisting of `(fi, ti)` is appended to `p`**
