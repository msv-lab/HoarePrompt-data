Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes an input string 'w' and creates a dictionary 'memo' to store the frequency of each character in the string. It then iterates over the values in the dictionary and checks if any character count is odd. If an odd count is found, it sets the 'result' variable to False, otherwise, it remains True. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if 'result' is True and 'No' if 'result' is False.

The code follows the problem description as it correctly determines if the input string 'w' is beautiful or not by checking if each lowercase letter occurs an even number of times. The code covers all potential cases given the constraints of the problem and the examples provided. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code's functionality by confirming that it checks for odd character counts in the input string to determine beauty.
