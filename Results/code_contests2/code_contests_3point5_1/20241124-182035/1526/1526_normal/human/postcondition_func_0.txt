The function func_1 takes user input as a string and creates a dictionary 'memo' that stores the frequency of each character in the input string. It then checks if the count of any character in the dictionary is odd. If any character count is odd, it prints 'No', otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not explicitly return any value. Missing functionality includes not accounting for uppercase letters, special characters, or numbers in the input string.
