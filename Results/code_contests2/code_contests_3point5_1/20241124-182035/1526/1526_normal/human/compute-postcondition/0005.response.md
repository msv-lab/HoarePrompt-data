Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and `memo` is a dictionary. If `c` is not a key in `memo`, then `memo[c]` is assigned the value 0. After the execution of the if statement, the state of the program is such that if `c` was not present in `memo` before, it now exists with a value of 0. All other variables retain their initial values.***
