Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least three values, `result` is either True or False. If the value of `x` is such that `x` % 2 is greater than 0, then `result` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
