According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s` and the current index. If the current index is less than the length of string `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with length greater than the current index + 1, `memo` is a dictionary where `c` exists with a value increased by 1, and the current index is increased by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- The length of string `s` should be greater than the new current index + 1.
- The new current index should be increased by 1.
- If `c` is not already a key in the `memo` dictionary, it should be added with a value of 0.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with length greater than the new current index + 1, `memo` is a dictionary where `c` exists with a value increased by 1, new current index is increased by 1**
