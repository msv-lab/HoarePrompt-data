According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If the dictionary `memo` has at least one value, the loop executes. Since `s` is a non-empty string, the dictionary `memo` will have values representing the frequency of characters in `s`. So for the loop to be executed, `memo` should have at least one value. At the start of the loop, `result` is True. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `s` is a non-empty string, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one value, and `result` is True.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one value, `result` is True**.
