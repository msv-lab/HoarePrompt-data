According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary where if `c` was not present before, it now exists with a value of 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must still have characters left to iterate over. This means that the length of `s` should be greater than the current index being processed in the loop. Additionally, the dictionary `memo` must be updated with the current character `c` if it was not present before.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with length greater than the current index, `memo` is a dictionary where if `c` was not present before, it now exists with a value of 1**
