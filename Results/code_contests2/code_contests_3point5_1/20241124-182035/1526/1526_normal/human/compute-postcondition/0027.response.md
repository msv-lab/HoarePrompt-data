According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If there are more values to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least two values, `result` is either True or False. If `x` % 2 is greater than 0, `result` is set to False. To execute the loop one more time, `memo` should have at least three values. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least three values, `result` is either True or False**
