According to the code, the loop can execute if the current index is less than the length of string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with length greater than the current index, `memo` is a dictionary where `c` exists with an incremented value. To execute the loop one more time, the current index should be incremented by 1.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with length greater than the current index + 1, `memo` is a dictionary where `c` exists with an incremented value, current index is increased by 1**
