According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If there are more values to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least three values, `result` is either True or False. For the loop to execute one more time, the dictionary `memo` must have at least four values to iterate over.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least four values, `result` is either True or False**
