Output State: **If `s` is a non-empty string, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one value, `result` is either True or False. If any value in `memo` is odd, `result` is set to False and the loop breaks. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `memo` remains an empty dictionary.**
