According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more values in the `memo` dictionary to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one value, `result` is True. If the value of `x` is odd, then `result` is set to False and the loop breaks. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `memo` dictionary needs to have at least one more value to iterate over, and the value of `x` should not be odd.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least two values, `result` is True**
