According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in string `s` to iterate over. Since `s` is accepted as raw input, it can be any string with any number of characters. So, for the loop to execute, `s` must not be an empty string. 
At the beginning of the loop, the `memo` dictionary is empty, and `c` will represent each character in string `s` during each iteration.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string accepted as raw input, `memo` is an empty dictionary**
