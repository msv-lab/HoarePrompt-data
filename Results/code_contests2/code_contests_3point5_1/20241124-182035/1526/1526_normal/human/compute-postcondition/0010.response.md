Example Answer:
The value of `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` was not present in the dictionary before, it now exists with a value of 1. Otherwise, the value of `memo[c]` is increased by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with length greater than the current index, `memo` is a dictionary where `c` exists with an incremented value**
