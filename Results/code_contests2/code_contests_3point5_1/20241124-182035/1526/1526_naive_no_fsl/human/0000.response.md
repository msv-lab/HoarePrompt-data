Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input string, counts the occurrences of each character, and then checks if each character occurs an even number of times. If all characters occur even number of times, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases, making it correct.
