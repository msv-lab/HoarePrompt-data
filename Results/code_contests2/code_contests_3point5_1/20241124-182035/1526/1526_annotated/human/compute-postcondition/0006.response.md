Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If the value of `memo[c]` was previously 0, it becomes 1. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary where the value of `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary where the value of `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1**
