According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the memo dictionary. If the dictionary has at least 1 key-value pair, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `w` remains unchanged as a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, and `memo` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair. For the loop to execute, `x` should be the value of the first key-value pair in the `memo` dictionary.
State: **`w` remains unchanged as a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, `memo` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, `x` is the value of the first key-value pair in the `memo` dictionary**
