Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary. If the character `c` is not in `memo`, then `memo` is updated with `c` as the key and 0 as the value. In all cases, the initial state of `w`, `s`, and `c` is retained.***
