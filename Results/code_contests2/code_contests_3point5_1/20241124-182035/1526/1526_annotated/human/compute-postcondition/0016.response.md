Output State: **After the loop executes, `w` remains unchanged as a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, and `memo` is a dictionary where the value of `memo[c]` corresponds to the frequency of each character in `s`. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `memo` remains an empty dictionary.**
