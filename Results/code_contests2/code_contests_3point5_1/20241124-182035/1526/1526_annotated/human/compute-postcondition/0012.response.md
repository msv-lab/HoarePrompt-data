Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is assigned the value 0. The variable `c` is not defined in the initial state, so this code will result in an error. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
Output State: **Error: variable `c` is not defined. `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, the dictionary `memo` remains unchanged**
