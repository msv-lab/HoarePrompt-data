According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters remaining in the input string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, and `memo` dictionary remains unchanged. If `c` is not present in `memo`, then `memo[c]` is set to 1. If `c` is already present in `memo`, `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the input string `s` must still have at least 1 character remaining. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, `memo` dictionary remains unchanged**
