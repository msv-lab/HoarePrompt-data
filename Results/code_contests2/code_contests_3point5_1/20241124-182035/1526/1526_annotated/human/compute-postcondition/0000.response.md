Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which takes input from the user. The previous value of `w` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string**
