Postcondition: ***`w` remains unchanged as a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, `memo` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs with the next odd number value assigned to `x`, and the `result` is not False. If the condition x % 2 > 0 is true, then the result is set to False and the loop breaks.***
