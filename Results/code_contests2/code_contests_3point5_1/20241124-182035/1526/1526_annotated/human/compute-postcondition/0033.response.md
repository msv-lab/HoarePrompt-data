Example Answer:
If there is at least one odd frequency of a character in the `memo` dictionary, then `result` is set to False and the loop breaks. If all frequencies are even, then `result` remains unchanged. If `memo` is an empty dictionary, the loop does not execute and `result` remains unchanged. Finally, the code prints 'Yes' if `result` is True and 'No' if `result` is False.
Output State: **Based on the conditions in the loop, the `result` variable may have been updated to False or remained unchanged. The loop may have broken or not executed. The output of the code will be 'Yes' if `result` is True and 'No' if `result` is False.**
