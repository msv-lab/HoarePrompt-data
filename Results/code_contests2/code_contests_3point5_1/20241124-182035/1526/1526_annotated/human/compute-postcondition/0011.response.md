According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more characters in the input string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, and the dictionary `memo` has been updated as described. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the input string `s` must still have at least 1 character remaining.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, the dictionary `memo` remains unchanged**
