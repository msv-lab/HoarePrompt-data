According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more values in the `memo` dictionary. At the end of the last iteration, `w` remains unchanged as a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, `memo` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, `x` is the value of the first key-value pair in the `memo` dictionary which is an odd number. If x % 2 > 0, the `result` is False, and the program terminates after the if statement. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, you need to ensure that there is at least one more key-value pair in the `memo` dictionary with an odd value. This means that `x` should be assigned the value of the next odd number in the dictionary, and `result` should not be False to continue the loop.

State: **`w` remains unchanged as a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, `memo` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs with the next odd number value assigned to `x`, and the `result` is not False**
