According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the input string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary where the value of `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the input string `s` should still have characters left to iterate over. The string `w` and the dictionary `memo` do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted. Only the state of `s` needs to be adjusted to ensure there is at least one more character left in the string.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, `memo` is a dictionary where the value of `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1**
