Example Answer: 
`memo[c]` is assigned the value `0`, where `c` is a key in the dictionary `memo`. The value of `memo[c]` is then set to `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, and `memo` is a dictionary where the value of `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1 except for the key `c` which is now 0.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, and `memo` is a dictionary where the value of `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1 except for the key `c` which is now 0**
