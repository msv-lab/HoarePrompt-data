Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character remaining, and `memo` is a dictionary where the value of `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1 except for the key `c` which is now 0 if `c` was not in `memo` initially. If `c` was already in `memo`, then the value remains unchanged.***
