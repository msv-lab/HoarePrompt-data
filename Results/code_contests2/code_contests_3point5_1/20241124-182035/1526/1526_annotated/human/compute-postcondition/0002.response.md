According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the string `s`. So, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string with at least 1 character, `memo` is an empty dictionary, `c` is the first character in `s`**
