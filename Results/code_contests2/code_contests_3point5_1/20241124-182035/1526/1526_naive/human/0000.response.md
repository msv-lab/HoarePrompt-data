Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input string, counts the occurrences of each letter, and then checks if each letter occurs an even number of times. If any letter occurs an odd number of times, the result is set to False and the program prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The program follows the problem description for every potential case, ensuring that the string is considered beautiful only if every letter occurs even number of times.
