Example Answer:
The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input string using `raw_input()`. Since `s` is the input string, the value of `s` is captured by `raw_input()` and assigned to `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string, `t` is the input string.
Output State: **`s` is the input string, `t` is the input string**
