Example Answer:
The code checks if the input string `s` can be rotated to match the input string `t`. If such rotation exists, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The values of `s` and `t` are not altered during the execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string, `t` is the input string.
Output State: **`s` is the input string, `t` is the input string**
