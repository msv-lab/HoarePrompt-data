Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the logic to determine if string S equals string T after a rotation. It iterates through all possible rotations of string T and checks if any of them match string S. If a match is found, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. This logic covers all potential cases as per the problem description. The code also meets the constraints provided in the problem description.
