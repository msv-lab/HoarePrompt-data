Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program takes two strings as input, S and T, and then checks if T can be obtained from S after a series of rotations. The program iterates through all possible rotations of T and checks if any of them match S. If a match is found, it prints "Yes", otherwise "No".

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all possible cases. It correctly determines if S equals T after rotation for all inputs.
