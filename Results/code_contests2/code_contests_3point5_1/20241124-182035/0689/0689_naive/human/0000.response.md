Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes two strings `s` and `t` as input, then it iterates through all possible rotations of string `t` and checks if any of them equals string `s`. If it finds a match, it prints `Yes`, otherwise it prints `No`.

This logic correctly implements the problem description of checking if string `s` equals string `t` after rotation. The program covers all possible rotations of string `t` and compares it with `s`, thus meeting the requirements of the problem statement. Since the program is checking all possible cases and rotations, it is correct.
