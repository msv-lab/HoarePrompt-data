Functionality: **The function `func` reads two strings `s` and `t` as input. It then compares all possible rotations of string `t` to see if any of them match string `s`. If a match is found, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. The strings `s` and `t` are expected to consist of lowercase English letters and have lengths between 2 and 100, with the lengths of `s` and `t` being equal.**
