Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads two strings `s` and `t` as input. It then compares all possible rotations of string `t` to see if any of them match string `s`. If a match is found, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The code aligns with the problem description as it correctly determines if `S` equals `T` after rotation by checking all possible rotations of `t`. The code also handles the constraints provided in the problem description. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code, confirming that the code correctly implements the required logic.
