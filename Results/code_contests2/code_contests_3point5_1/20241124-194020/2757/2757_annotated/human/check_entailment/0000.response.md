Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a given character is a consonant by verifying if it is not a vowel. This logic aligns with the problem description. Since the function is used to determine if a character is a consonant, and the overall program seems to correctly implement the typo detection and correction based on consonant sequences, we can conclude that the program is correct.
