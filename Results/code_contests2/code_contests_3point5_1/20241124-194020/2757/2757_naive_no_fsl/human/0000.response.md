Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. It does not handle the case where there are more than three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block. The program only checks for exactly three consonants in a row and does not consider blocks with more than three consonants. 

For example, if the input word is "backtothefutttture", the program should output "back to the futttture" to separate the block of "ttt" into a separate word. However, the current program implementation will not handle this case and will not output the correct result.
