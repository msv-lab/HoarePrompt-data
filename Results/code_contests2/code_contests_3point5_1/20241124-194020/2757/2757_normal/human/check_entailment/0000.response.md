Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. The program incorrectly considers blocks of vowels as typos and tries to insert spaces in them. This is not in line with the problem description which states that typos only occur in blocks of consonants, not vowels. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where there are more than two different letters in a block of three or more consonants. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not fully adhere to the problem description.
