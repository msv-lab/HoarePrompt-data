Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the described algorithm. It checks if there are two adjacent stacks whose heights differ by two or more, and if so, sets the flag to False. It then removes the tallest stack and repeats the process until all stacks have been removed. The final output is "YES" if the flag remains True, indicating that the array can be sorted using the described procedure, and "NO" otherwise. The program handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
