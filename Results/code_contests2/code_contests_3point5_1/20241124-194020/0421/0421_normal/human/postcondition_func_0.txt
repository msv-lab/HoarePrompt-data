The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then iterates through the list to check if the absolute difference between any two consecutive integers is less than 2. If this condition is met for all pairs of consecutive integers, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return any value. However, the code is missing a return value to indicate the final result.
