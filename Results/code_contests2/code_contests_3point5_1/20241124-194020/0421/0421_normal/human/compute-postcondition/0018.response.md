Output State: **`n` is an input string, `flag` is a boolean. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the loop breaks. There are no other changes to the variables `n`, `flag`, and `nums`. If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute. `nums` has the maximum element removed.**
