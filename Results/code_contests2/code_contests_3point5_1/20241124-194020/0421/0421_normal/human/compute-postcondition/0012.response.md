According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input string and `flag` is a boolean. No specific conditions are provided for `n` and `flag` to determine if the loop can execute again. So, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an input string, `flag` is a boolean**
