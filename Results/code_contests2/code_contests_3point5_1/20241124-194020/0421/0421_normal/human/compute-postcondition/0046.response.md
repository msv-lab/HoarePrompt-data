According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition related to the elements in the `nums` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements with the maximum element removed, and `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` must not be greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the conditions for the next iteration are that the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` must not be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is an input string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements with the maximum element removed, and `i` is 2**
