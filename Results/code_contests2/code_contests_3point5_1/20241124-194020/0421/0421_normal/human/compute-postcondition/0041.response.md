Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements with the maximum element removed, `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` of `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop.***
