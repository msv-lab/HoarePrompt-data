According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements with the maximum element removed, and `i` is the index of the last element checked in the loop. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `flag` needs to remain True.
2. `nums` should not be empty.
3. If `i` is the index of the last element checked, then for the next iteration, `i` should be adjusted to the index of the next element to be checked.

State: **`n` is an input string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements with the maximum element removed, `i` is the index of the next element to be checked**
