According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 2. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, so `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 3**
