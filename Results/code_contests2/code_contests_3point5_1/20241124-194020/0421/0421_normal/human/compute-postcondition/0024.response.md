Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
