According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input string, `flag` is a boolean, and the values of `n`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than the length of `nums`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input string, `flag` is a boolean, `i` is less than the length of `nums`**
