Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements with the maximum element removed, and `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the loop or if statement is exited.***
