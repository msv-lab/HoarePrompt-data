Example Answer: 
`flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `flag` is either True or False, and now it is set to False. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
