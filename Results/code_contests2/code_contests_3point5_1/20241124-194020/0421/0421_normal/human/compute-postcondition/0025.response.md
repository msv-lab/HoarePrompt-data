According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0. Since the loop is designed to check the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]`, and if the difference is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the loop is broken, the next iteration should have `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` such that their absolute difference is less than 2 to not break the loop.
State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
