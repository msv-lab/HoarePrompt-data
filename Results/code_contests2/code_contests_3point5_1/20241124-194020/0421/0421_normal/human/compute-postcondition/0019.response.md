According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, there are no changes to `n`, `flag`, and `nums`. If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `nums` list must have at least 2 elements and `flag` must remain True.
State: **`n` is an input string, `flag` is a boolean, `nums` has at least 2 elements and `flag` remains True**
