According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `nums` is at least 2. To modify the state before the loop starts for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be converted to an integer, `flag` should remain True, and `i` should be 0.
State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is True, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
