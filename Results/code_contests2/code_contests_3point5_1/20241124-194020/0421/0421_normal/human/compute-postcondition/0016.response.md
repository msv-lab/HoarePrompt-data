According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input string and `flag` is a boolean. The only condition that would prevent the loop from executing again is if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, which would set `flag` to False. Since there are no other changes to `n` and `flag`, the loop will execute one more time if the absolute difference between the next `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is not greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is an input string, `flag` is a boolean**
