According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `nums`, and `flag`. If the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` is not greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` was not greater than or equal to 2, then `i` should be adjusted to 2 to move to the next iteration.
State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
