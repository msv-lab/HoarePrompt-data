Output State: **If the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `flag` remains True after the loop finishes executing. `n` is an input string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is the index of the last element checked in the loop.**
