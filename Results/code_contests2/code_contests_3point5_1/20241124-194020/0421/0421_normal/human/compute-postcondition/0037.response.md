According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `nums` list has at least 2 elements with the maximum element removed. Since the loop iterates over `len(nums) - 1`, the length of `nums` must be at least 2. The loop index `i` starts at 0, so it needs to be adjusted to the first index in the list. 
State: **`n` is an input string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements with the maximum element removed, `i` is 0**
