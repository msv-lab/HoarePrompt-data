Output State: **If `nums` contains at least 2 integers and the absolute difference between any two consecutive integers in `nums` is less than 2, `flag` remains True, `n` is the input string, and the maximum element is removed from `nums`. If `nums` has less than 2 integers, the loop does not execute, and the initial values of `n` and `flag` are retained. If the absolute difference between any two consecutive integers in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the loop breaks. Then, print 'NO' if flag is False, and 'YES' if flag is True.**
