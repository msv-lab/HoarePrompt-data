According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements with the maximum element removed, and `i` is 2. Since the condition to exit the loop is related to `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]`, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is that the absolute difference between nums[2] and nums[3] is less than 2.
State: **`n` is an input string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements with the maximum element removed, and `i` is 2, the absolute difference between nums[2] and nums[3] is less than 2**
