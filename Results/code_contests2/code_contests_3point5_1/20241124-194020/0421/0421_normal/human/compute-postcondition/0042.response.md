According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements with the maximum element removed, and `i` is 0. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1 so that it is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements with the maximum element removed, `i` is 1**
