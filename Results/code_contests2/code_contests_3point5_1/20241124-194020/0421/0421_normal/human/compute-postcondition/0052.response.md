Output State: **`n` remains an input string, `i` will be the index of the next element to be checked. If there exists at least 2 elements in `nums` with the maximum element removed, `flag` will be False if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2. If `nums` has less than 2 elements, or the maximum element has not been removed, the loop will not execute, and `flag` will retain its initial value.**
