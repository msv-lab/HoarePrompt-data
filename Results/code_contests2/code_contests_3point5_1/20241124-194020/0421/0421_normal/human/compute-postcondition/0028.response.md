Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
