According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` map object. If the map object has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the `n` input string and `flag` being True do not directly affect the loop execution. So, for the loop to be executed, the `nums` map object must have at least 2 integers, and `i` should start at 0.
State: **`n` is an input string, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, `i` is 0**
