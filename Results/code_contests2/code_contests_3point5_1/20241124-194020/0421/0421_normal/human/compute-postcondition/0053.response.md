According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains an input string, `i` will be the index of the next element to be checked. If there exists at least 2 elements in `nums` with the maximum element removed, `flag` will be False if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, the maximum element in `nums` needs to be removed and there should be at least 2 elements in `nums` after the removal, and the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `nums` should not be greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` remains an input string, `i` will be the index of the next element to be checked, and the necessary conditions for `flag` and `nums` to allow the loop to execute one more time are met**
