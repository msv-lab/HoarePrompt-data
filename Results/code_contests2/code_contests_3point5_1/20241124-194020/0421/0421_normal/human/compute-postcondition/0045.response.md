Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 2 elements with the maximum element removed, and `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.***
