Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program is supposed to determine if the given array can be sorted correctly using the described procedure. However, the code only checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive integers is less than 2, but it does not fully implement the algorithm described in the problem.

The output hints also confirm that the code is incorrect as it is missing a return value to indicate the final result. Therefore, based on both the code and the output hints, the correctness of the program is false.
