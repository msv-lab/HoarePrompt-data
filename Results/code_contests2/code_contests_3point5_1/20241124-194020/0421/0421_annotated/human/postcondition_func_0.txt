The function `func` reads an input integer `n`, followed by a list of integers. It iterates over the list and checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements is less than 2. If this condition is met for all pairs, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If the list is initially empty, no output is generated. However, there is a logical issue with removing the maximum element from the list in each iteration, which could potentially affect the result.
