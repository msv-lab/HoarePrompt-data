According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, and `i` is an integer initialized to 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, and `i` is an integer incremented by 1**
