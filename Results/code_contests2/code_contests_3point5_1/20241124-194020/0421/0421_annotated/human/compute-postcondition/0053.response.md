According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean variable, the maximum element in `nums` has been removed, `nums` still contains elements, and `i` is the last index of `nums` - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `flag` must still be True and `nums` must not be empty.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is not empty**.
