According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If both `flag` is True and `nums` is not an empty list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has the maximum element removed. For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` needs to remain True and `nums` must not be empty after removing the maximum element.
State: **`nums` has the maximum element removed, `flag` is True, and `nums` is not empty**
