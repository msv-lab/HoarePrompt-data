According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. The loop will execute as long as the length of `nums` is greater than or equal to 2. Since the `max(nums)` has been removed, the loop will execute if there are at least 2 elements in `nums`. Before the loop starts, `flag` being True does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `flag` is True, `max(nums)` has been removed, `nums` still has elements, and the index `i` is 0.
State: **`flag` is True, `max(nums)` has been removed, `nums` still has elements, `i` is 0**
