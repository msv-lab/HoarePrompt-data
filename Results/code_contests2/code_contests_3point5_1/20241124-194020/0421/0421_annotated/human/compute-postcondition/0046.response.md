According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean variable, `max(nums)` has been removed, `nums` still has elements, and `i` is 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 2 to move to the next index in the list.
State: **`flag` is a boolean variable, `max(nums)` has been removed, `nums` still has elements, `i` is 2**
