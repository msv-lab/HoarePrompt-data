According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `flag` is True and there are elements in `nums`. The loop will break when `flag` is set to False. At the end of the last iteration, the condition that sets `flag` to False did not occur. Additionally, the maximum element in `nums` has been removed. To execute the loop one more time, `flag` must remain True and there must still be elements in `nums`.
State: **`flag` is True, `max(nums)` has been removed, and `nums` still has elements**
