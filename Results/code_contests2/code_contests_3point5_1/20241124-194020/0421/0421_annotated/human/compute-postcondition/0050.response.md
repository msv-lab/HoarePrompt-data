According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean variable, if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, `max(nums)` has been removed, `nums` still contains elements, and `i` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`flag` is a boolean variable, if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, `max(nums)` has been removed, `nums` still contains elements, and `i` is 3**
