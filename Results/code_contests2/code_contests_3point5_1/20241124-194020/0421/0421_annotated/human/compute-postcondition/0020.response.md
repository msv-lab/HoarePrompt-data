According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of `nums` is greater than 1. Since `nums` is not empty, the loop will execute. The loop will iterate from 0 to the second last index of `nums`, so the loop will not iterate if `nums` has only one element. Before the loop starts, the maximum element has been removed from `nums`, so the maximum element is now the second last element in `nums`. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` remains True, and `i` starts from 0.
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is True, `i` is 0**
