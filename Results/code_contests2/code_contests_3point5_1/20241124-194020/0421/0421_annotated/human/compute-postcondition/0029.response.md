According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, and `i` is an integer incremented by 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` remains False and the loop is broken. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of `nums` minus 2.
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, and `i` is an integer less than the length of `nums` minus 2**
