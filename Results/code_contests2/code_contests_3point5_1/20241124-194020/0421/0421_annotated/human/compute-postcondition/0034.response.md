Output State: **If the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False. The loop will continue until this condition is met. Once `flag` is set to False, the loop breaks. If the condition is not met for any pair of consecutive elements in `nums`, `flag` remains True.**
