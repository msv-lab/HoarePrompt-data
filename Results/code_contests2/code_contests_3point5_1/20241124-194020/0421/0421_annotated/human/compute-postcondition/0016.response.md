According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` has a length of at least 2, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 since it should be less than the length of `nums` minus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, flag is False, nums has a length of at least 2, and i is 3**
