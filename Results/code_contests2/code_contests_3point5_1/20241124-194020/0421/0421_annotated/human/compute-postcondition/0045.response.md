Postcondition: ***`flag` is a boolean variable. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False. `max(nums)` has been removed, `nums` still has elements, and `i` is 1. In all cases where the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2, the program continues without changing `flag`, `nums`, or `i`.***
