Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is a boolean that is False, and `i` is an integer initialized to 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
