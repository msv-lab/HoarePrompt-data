`n` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The state of the list `ai` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive**.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive**
