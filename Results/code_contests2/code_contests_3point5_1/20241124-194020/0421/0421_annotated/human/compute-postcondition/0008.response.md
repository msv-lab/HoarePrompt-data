According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is not greater than or equal to 2. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, flag is False, nums has a length of at least 2, i is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] must not be greater than or equal to 2, and i needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, flag is False, nums has a length of at least 2, i is 1**
