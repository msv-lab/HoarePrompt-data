Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, flag is False, nums has a length of at least 2, i is 0. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, then the flag is set to False and the program breaks.***
