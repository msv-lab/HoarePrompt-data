Postcondition: ***`flag` is a boolean variable. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, `max(nums)` has been removed, `nums` still contains elements, and `i` is 2. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
