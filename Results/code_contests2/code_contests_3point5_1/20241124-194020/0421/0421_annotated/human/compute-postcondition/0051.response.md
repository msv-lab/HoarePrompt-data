Output State: **After the loop executes, `flag` is a boolean variable. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False. `max(nums)` has been removed, `nums` still contains elements, and `i` is the last index of `nums` - 1. In cases where the absolute difference condition is not met, the loop continues without altering `flag`, `nums`, or `i`. If `nums` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and `flag` remains True.**
