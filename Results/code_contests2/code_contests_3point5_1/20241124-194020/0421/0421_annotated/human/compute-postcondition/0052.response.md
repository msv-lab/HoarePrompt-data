Output State: **After the loop executes, `flag` is a boolean variable. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False. The maximum element in `nums` has been removed, `nums` still contains elements, and `i` is the last index of `nums` - 1.**
