Output State: **If `nums` is not empty and no absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` remains True until the loop finishes. The maximum element is removed from `nums` after each iteration, and the loop continues until the condition is met. If `nums` is initially empty, the loop will not execute.**
