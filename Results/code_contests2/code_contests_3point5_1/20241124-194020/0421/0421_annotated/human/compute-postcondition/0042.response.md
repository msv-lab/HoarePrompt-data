According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean variable, `max(nums)` has been removed, `nums` still has elements, and `i` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`flag` is a boolean variable, if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False. `max(nums)` has been removed, `nums` still has elements, and `i` is 1**
