According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `nums` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, n being a positive integer does not ensure the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `nums` has a length of at least 2, i is 0, and flag remains True.
State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, flag is True, nums has a length of at least 2, i is 0**
