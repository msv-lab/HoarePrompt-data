Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the described algorithm for sorting the array using ravioli stacks. It checks if the absolute difference between adjacent elements in the array is less than 2, which ensures that the top ravioli from a taller stack will not slide down onto a shorter stack. The program then removes the tallest stack and continues until all stacks are removed. The logic seems to be correct and there are no cases provided where the program fails to produce the correct output.
