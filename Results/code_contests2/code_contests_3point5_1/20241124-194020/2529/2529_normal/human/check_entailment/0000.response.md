Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description clearly states that the input jump coordinates are given in the form of arithmetic expressions `(a+b)/c`, but the code is attempting to read float numbers directly from the input without considering the arithmetic expression format. This means that the code will not be able to correctly parse the input and count the number of ships with the same coordinates. This discrepancy between the problem description and the code logic makes the code incorrect.
