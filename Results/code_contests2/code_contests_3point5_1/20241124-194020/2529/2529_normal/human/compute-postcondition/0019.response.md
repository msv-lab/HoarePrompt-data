Example Answer: 
`my_list` appends the count of the second element in `test_list`, which is the value of `i`. The previous values of `my_list` and `i` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `my_list` contains the count of the second element in `test_list` and the value of `i+1`.
Output State: **`my_list` contains the count of the second element in `test_list` and the value of `i+1`**
