Example Answer: 
`test_list` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `m` is unknown as it was assigned the input integer representing the number of ships. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is assigned the value of the input integer representing the number of ships; `test_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`m` is assigned the value of the input integer representing the number of ships; `test_list` is an empty list**
