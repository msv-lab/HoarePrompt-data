Example Answer:
The value `e` is appended to the `test_list`. Since `e` is a float value, it is added to the `test_list`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `test_list` contains the input float `e`.
Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `test_list` contains the input float `e`**
