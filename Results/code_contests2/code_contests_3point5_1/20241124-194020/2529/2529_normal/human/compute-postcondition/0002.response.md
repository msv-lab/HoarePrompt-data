According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `m` is assigned the value of the input integer representing the number of ships, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, since the loop iterates over the range of `m`, the value of `i` at the start of the loop should be 0.
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `test_list` is an empty list**
