Example Answer:
The value of `e` is appended to `test_list`, which is an empty list. The value of `e` is provided as input and is a float. Therefore, after execution, `test_list` will contain the value of `e` as a float. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `test_list` contains the input float `e`**
