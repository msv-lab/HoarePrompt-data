Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `m` from the user input, then reads `m` float numbers also from the input. It appends these floats to a list `test_list`. After that, it iterates over `test_list` and counts occurrences of each unique element, storing these counts in a new list `my_list`. Finally, it prints the counts of each unique element in `test_list` separated by spaces. If `m` is 0 or negative, the `test_list` will be empty, and `my_list` will also be empty. The function does not specify any return values or additional functionality beyond printing the counts.**
