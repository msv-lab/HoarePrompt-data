According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `test_list` contains the input float `e`**
