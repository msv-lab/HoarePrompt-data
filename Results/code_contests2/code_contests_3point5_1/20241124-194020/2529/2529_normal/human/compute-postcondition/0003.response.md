Example Answer: 
`e` is assigned the value of `float(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `float` converts it to a float. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `test_list` is an empty list, `e` is an input float.
Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `test_list` is an empty list, `e` is an input float**
