Output State: **If m is greater than 0, the loop will execute m times, where each time the input float e will be appended to the test_list. After the loop executes, m will remain the same as the input value, i will be equal to m-1, and test_list will contain m input floats. If m is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and test_list will remain empty.**
