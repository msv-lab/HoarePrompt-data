According to the code, the loop can execute if `test_list` is not empty. Since `my_list` is an empty list, it needs to be adjusted to ensure that `test_list` is not empty. Additionally, the loop variable `i` will take on the values from `test_list`, so for the loop to execute, `i` should be the first element of `test_list`.

State: **`my_list` is an empty list, `test_list` is not empty, `i` is the first element of `test_list`**
