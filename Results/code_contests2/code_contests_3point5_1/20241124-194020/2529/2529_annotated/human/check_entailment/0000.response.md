Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description. It is expecting float inputs, whereas the problem description specifies that the jump coordinates are given in the form of arithmetic expressions like (a+b)/c. Additionally, the program is counting occurrences of float values in the list, which is not the correct approach to solving the problem.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
4
(99+98)/97
(26+4)/10
(12+33)/15
(5+1)/7

Expected Output:
1 2 2 1

The program will not produce the correct output for this input.
