The function reads an integer `m` from the user as input then reads `m` float numbers into a list `test_list`. It then iterates over `test_list` to count the occurrences of each element and stores the counts in a new list `my_list`. Finally, it prints the counts as space-separated integers. If `m` is 0 or negative, the `for` loops will not execute, and no counts will be printed.
