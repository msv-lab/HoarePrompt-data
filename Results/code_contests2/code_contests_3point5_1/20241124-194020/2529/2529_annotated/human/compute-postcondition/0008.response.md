According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer and `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 since it must be less than `m`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `test_list` contains the float value `e`**
