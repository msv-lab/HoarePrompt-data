Example Answer: 
The count of occurrences of `i` in the updated `test_list` is calculated using the `count()` method, and the result is appended to `my_list`. The updated `my_list` now contains the count of occurrences of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `my_list` contains the count of occurrences of `i` in the updated `test_list`.
Output State: **`my_list` contains the count of occurrences of `i` in the updated `test_list`**
