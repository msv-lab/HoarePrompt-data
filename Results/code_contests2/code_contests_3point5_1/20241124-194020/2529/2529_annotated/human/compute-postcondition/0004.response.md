Example Answer: 
A float value `e` is appended to the `test_list`. The value of `e` is obtained from input, and `m` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, and `test_list` is an empty list. After execution, the `test_list` will contain the float value `e`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `test_list` contains the float value `e`.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `test_list` contains the float value `e`**
