The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It generates jump coordinates for ships based on the given constraints. Each jump coordinate is in the form of (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers of up to two decimal digits. The function returns these jump coordinates for the specified number of ships (m), which is a positive integer. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to generate jump coordinates for the specified number of ships based on the given constraints. 
Functionality: **The function generates jump coordinates for the specified number of ships based on the given constraints.**
