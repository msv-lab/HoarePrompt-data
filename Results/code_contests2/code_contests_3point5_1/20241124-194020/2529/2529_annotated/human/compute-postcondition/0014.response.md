According to the code, the loop can execute if the test_list is not empty. Before the loop starts, my_list is an empty list, so it needs to be adjusted to test_list is not empty. Additionally, since the loop iterates over elements in test_list, we need to set i to be the first element in test_list.
State: **my_list is an empty list, test_list is not empty, i is the first element in test_list**
