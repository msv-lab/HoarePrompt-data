According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `test_list` contains two float values including `e`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `test_list` contains two float values including `e`**
