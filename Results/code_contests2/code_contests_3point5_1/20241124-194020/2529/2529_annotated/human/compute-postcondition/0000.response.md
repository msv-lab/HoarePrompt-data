`m` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `m` represents the number of ships and will be determined by the user input. Therefore, the Output State is: m is a positive integer representing the number of ships.
Output State: **m is a positive integer representing the number of ships**
