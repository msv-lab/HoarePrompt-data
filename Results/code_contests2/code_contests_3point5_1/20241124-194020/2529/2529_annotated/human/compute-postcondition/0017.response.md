Example Answer: 
The code appends the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list` to `my_list`. The count value is added to `my_list`, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `my_list` contains the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`.
Output State: **`my_list` contains the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`**
