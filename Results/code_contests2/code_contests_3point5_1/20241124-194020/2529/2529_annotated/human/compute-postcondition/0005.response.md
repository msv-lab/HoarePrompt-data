According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `test_list` contains the float value `e`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `test_list` contains the float value `e`**
