According to the code, the loop will only execute if m is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, test_list is empty does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is a positive integer and `i` is now 0.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, test_list is an empty list**
