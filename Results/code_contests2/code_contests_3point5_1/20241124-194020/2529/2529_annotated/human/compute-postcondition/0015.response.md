Example Answer:
The value of `i` is the first element in `test_list`, and `test_list` is not empty. `count(i)` returns the number of occurrences of `i` in `test_list` and `my_list` appends this count. Therefore, after execution, `my_list` will contain the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`.
Output State: **`my_list` contains the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`**
