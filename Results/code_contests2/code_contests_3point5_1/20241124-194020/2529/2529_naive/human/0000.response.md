Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The program expects floating-point numbers as input, while the problem description clearly states that the input will be arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c. The program should parse and evaluate these arithmetic expressions to determine the coordinate of each ship. The current implementation does not handle the input format correctly.
