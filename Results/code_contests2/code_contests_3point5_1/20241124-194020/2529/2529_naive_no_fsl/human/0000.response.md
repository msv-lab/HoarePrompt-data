Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the input format described in the problem description. The program expects float input for each jump coordinate, while the problem description clearly states that the input will be in the form of an arithmetic expression (e.g., (a+b)/c). Therefore, the program will not work as expected for the given problem.
