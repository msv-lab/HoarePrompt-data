Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the minimum detection radius for the radar based on the input values of city coordinates and distances from the flatland rings. The program calculates the distance between the two cities, compares it with the sum of the radii of the rings, and calculates the minimum detection radius accordingly. The formula used in the program to calculate the minimum detection radius is in line with the problem description. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
