Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points given their coordinates. This function is essential for determining the minimum detection radius of the radar as described in the problem. The function itself is correct and accurately computes the distance between two points. Since the function is correctly implemented and serves the purpose of calculating distances required for the radar placement, the program is correct.
