Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts four parameters x1, y1, x2, y2 representing two points and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points using the distance formula. **

The function calculates the Euclidean distance as the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the x and y coordinates of the two points. It does not handle potential edge cases such as negative inputs or non-integer inputs, nor does it check if the input points are valid.
