The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, all of which are integers satisfying the constraints mentioned above. The function calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two points and return the Euclidean distance between these two points. 
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, y2 and returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)**
