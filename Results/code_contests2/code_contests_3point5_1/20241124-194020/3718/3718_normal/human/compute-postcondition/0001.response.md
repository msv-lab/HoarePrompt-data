The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `x1, y1, x2, y2`, which are integers within the range -10^4 to 10^4. The function also calculates the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), and returns the resulting distance as a floating-point number. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four integer parameters representing two points in a 2D plane, and return the Euclidean distance between these two points. 
Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters representing two points in a 2D plane and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points as a floating-point number.**
