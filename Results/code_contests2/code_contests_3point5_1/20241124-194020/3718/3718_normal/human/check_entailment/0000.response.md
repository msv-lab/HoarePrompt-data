Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes input in the form of two points in a 2D plane, along with their respective radii.
- It then calculates the Euclidean distance between the two points using the provided `func_1` function.
- Based on the calculated distance, the program determines the minimum detection radius for the radar as per the problem description.
- The output is formatted correctly with an absolute or relative error not exceeding 10^-6.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, as well as considering the provided examples, it can be concluded that the code meets the requirements and correctly determines the minimum detection radius for the radar.
