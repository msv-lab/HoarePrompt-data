Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing characters between ASCII code 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is a non-empty string where the next character `i` is not 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If the character `i` is in ['H', 'Q', '9'], then 'YES' is printed, `a` is set to 'tstr123', and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
