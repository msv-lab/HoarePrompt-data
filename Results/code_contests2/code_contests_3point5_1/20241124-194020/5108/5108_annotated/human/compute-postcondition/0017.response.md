According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is a string containing characters between ASCII code 33 and 126, `a` is a non-empty string where the next character `i` is not 'H', 'Q', or '9'. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
- The next character in `a` should not be 'H', 'Q', or '9'.
- If the character `i` is in ['H', 'Q', '9'], then 'YES' is printed, `a` needs to be set to 'tstr123'.

State: **`p` is a string containing characters between ASCII code 33 and 126, `a` is a non-empty string where the next character `i` is not 'H', 'Q', or '9'**
