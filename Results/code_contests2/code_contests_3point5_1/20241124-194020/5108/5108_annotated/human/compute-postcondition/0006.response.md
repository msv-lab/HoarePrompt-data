Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing characters between ASCII code 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is a non-empty string. If the character `i` is 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program prints 'YES', assigns 'tstr123' to `a`, and then breaks out of the loop. No changes occur if `i` is not in ['H', 'Q', '9'].***
