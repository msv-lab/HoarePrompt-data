The function `func` reads user input, iterates over each character in the input string, checks if the character is 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If it finds any of these characters, it prints 'YES', assigns 'tstr123' to the input string, and breaks out of the loop. If none of these characters are found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.
