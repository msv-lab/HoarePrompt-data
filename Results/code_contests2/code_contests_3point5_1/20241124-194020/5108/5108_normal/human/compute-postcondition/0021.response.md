Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is either 'tstr123' or a value different from 'tstr123', and `i` is either 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', the program prints 'NO'. If `a` is 'tstr123' and `i` is 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program prints 'YES', sets `a` to 'tstr123', and breaks out of the loop. If none of the characters in `a` are 'H', 'Q', or '9', the loop does not execute.***
