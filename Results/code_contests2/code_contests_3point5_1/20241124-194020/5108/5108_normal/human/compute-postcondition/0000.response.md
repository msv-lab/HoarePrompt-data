Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `raw_input()`. Since the given initial state mentions that `p` is a string, we can infer that `a` will contain the same value as `p`. Therefore, the output state is: p is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters. Each character of p has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive; a is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters. Each character of a has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive.
Output State: **p is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters. Each character of p has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive; a is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters. Each character of a has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive**
