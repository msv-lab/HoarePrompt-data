Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value 'tstr123'. The value of `a` is directly specified in the code and does not depend on any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is 'tstr123'.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is 'tstr123'**
