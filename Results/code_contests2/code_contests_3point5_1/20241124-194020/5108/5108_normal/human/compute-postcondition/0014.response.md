Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the string 'tstr123'. The previous values of the variables are not relevant to the assignment of 'tstr123' to `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is 'tstr123'.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is 'tstr123'**
