Example Answer: 
The code `print('YES')` simply prints 'YES' to the console. It does not modify any variables or change the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is 'tstr123'**
