Example Answer:
The variable `a` is reassigned the value `'tstr123'`. The values of `p` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is one of ['H', 'Q', '9'].
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is one of ['H', 'Q', '9']**
