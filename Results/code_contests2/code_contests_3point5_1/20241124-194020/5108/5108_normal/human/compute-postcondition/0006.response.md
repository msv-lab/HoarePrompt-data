Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is 'tstr123'. If `i` is in ['H', 'Q', '9'], the program prints 'YES', sets `a` to 'tstr123', and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. This covers all possible scenarios of the execution of the if statement.***
