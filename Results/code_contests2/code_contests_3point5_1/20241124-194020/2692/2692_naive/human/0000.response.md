Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly follows the problem description. It first reads the input integer `n` representing the length of the ticket number and then reads the ticket number itself as a list of integers. It then calculates the sum of the digits in the first half and the sum of the digits in the second half. Finally, it checks if the sums are equal and prints "YES" if they are, and "NO" otherwise.

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly checks for lucky numbers containing only 4 and 7, and ensures that the sum of the digits in the first half equals the sum of the digits in the second half for a ticket number to be considered lucky. Therefore, the code is correct.
