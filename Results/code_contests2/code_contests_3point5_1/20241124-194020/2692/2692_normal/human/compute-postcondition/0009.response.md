The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the constraints specified: an even integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list of integers `digits` of length `n`. The function operates on these predefined inputs and does not have any explicit parameters passed to it.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. It works with a predefined even integer `n` and a list of integers `digits` with length `n`.**
