Functionality: ** The function does not accept any explicit parameters. It reads an even integer `n` and a list of integers `digits` from the input. It then checks if the sum of the first half of the list elements is equal to the sum of the second half. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function ensures that `n` is within the range of 2 to 50 and that `digits` contains `n` integers.**
