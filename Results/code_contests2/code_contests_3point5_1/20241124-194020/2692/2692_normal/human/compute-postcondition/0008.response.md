Postcondition: ***n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; digits is a list of integers with length n. If the sum of the first half of the list elements is equal to the sum of the second half of the list elements, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The program ensures that the input n is in the range of 2 to 50 and digits contains n integers. The output is determined solely by the equality of the sums of the first and second halves of the list elements, printing 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.***
