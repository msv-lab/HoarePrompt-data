Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, it remains within this range. The other variables are not affected, so the Output State is: n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; digits is a list of integers with length n.
Output State: **n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; digits is a list of integers with length n**
