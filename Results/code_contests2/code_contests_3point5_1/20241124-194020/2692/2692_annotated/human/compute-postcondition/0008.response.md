Postcondition: ***n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. The ticket number is an integer of length n. If the sum of the first half of the ticket number's digits is equal to the sum of the second half, 'YES' is printed. If the sums are not equal, 'NO' is printed. The program handles all possible cases of splitting the ticket number into two halves, comparing their sums, and providing the appropriate output.***
