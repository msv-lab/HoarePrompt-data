Example Answer: 
The code takes the input integer, strips any leading or trailing whitespaces, and maps each character to an integer. Since the ticket number is an integer of length n, the `digits` variable will store each digit of the ticket number as separate integers. The length of the ticket number is n, so the number of elements in `digits` will be equal to n. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `digits` contains n individual integers representing the digits of the ticket number.
Output State: **n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `digits` contains n individual integers representing the digits of the ticket number**
