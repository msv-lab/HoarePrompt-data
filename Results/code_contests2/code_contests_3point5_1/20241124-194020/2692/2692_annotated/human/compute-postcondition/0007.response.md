Postcondition: ***n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, digits contains n individual integers representing the digits of the ticket number. If the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half of the digits, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The program handles all possible cases where the ticket number is split into two halves and compares the sums, providing the appropriate output based on the equality or inequality of the sums.***
