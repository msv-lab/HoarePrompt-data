The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. It reads an integer n and a sequence of n individual integers representing the digits of a ticket number. It then checks if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function assumes n is an even integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. It covers all cases where the ticket number is split into two halves, comparing their sums and providing the appropriate output.
