Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in the length of the ticket number and the ticket number itself, splits the ticket number into two halves, calculates the sum of each half, and then compares the sums. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES', indicating that the ticket is lucky, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
