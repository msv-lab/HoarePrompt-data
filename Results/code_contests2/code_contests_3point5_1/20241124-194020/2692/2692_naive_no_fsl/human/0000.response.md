Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not check whether the ticket number is a lucky number or not. The program only checks if the sum of digits in the first half of the ticket number is equal to the sum of digits in the second half. However, according to the problem description, a ticket is lucky only if it is a lucky number and satisfies the sum condition.

The program should first check if the ticket number is a lucky number and then proceed to check the sum condition. Therefore, the program needs to be updated to include the logic to check if the ticket number is a lucky number.
