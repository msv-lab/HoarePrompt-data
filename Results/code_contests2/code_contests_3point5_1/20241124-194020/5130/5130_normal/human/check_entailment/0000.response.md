Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The code calculates the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed in the permutation array `p` and the reverse sequence array `b` in order for each skewer to visit each of the 2n placements. However, the code does not consider cases where the skewers need to visit each placement in both directions. The code only handles cases where the skewers visit each placement in one direction. Additionally, the code's logic does not account for all possible scenarios where elements in the permutation and reverse sequence arrays need to be changed to achieve the desired outcome.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not fully adhere to the problem description.
