Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the values obtained from mapping integers from user input split by whitespace. Since the input is taken using `raw_input()`, and the elements in the list `p` were calculated as input integer - 1, `b` will contain the input values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each element being input integer - 1, and `b` contains the input values.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each element being input integer - 1, and `b` contains the input values**
