According to the code, the loop will execute at least once as long as `n` is 1 or greater. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers with each element being input integer - 1, `b` contains the input values, `comps` has all elements equal to 1, `col` is 1, `i` is the last valid index. For the loop to execute one more time, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers with each element being input integer - 1, `b` contains the input values, `comps` is a list of `n` ones, `col` is 1, `i` is the last valid index according to `p`.**
