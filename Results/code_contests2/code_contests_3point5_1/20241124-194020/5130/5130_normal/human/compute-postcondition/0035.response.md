Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers with each element being input integer - 1, `b` contains the input values, `comps` is a list of `n` ones, `col` is 1, `i` is the last valid index according to `p`. If comps[i] is 0, then col is incremented by 1 and comps[i] is updated to col. If comps[p[j]] is 0 at the start of the loop, the loop does not run. Otherwise, the loop sets comps[j] to col for each iteration until comps[p[j]] becomes 0. The final state has comps updated with col values for the indices traversed by j.***
