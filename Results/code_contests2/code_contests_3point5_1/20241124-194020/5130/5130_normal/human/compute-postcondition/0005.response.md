According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. However, it also depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Before the loop starts, `n` is already given as an input integer, so it satisfies the condition. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to set `i` to 0.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each element being input integer - 1, `b` contains the input values, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 0, `i` is 0**
