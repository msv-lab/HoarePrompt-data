Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers with each element being input integer - 1, `b` contains the input values, `comps` is a list of `n` ones with the value at index p[j] being non-zero, `col` is 1, `i` is the last valid index according to `p`. If there exists a valid sequence of indices according to `p` such that comps[p[j]] is non-zero for all j, then after the if block executes, the final state will have comps[j] set to col for all valid j. If comps[p[j]] is non-zero for all j initially, the loop will not execute. If there is no valid sequence of indices according to p, the loop may result in an infinite loop. If the loop does execute, it will terminate with comps[j] set to col for all valid j.***
