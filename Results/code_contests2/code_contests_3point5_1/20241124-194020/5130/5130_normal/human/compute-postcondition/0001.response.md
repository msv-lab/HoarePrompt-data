Example Answer: 
A list `p` is created by subtracting 1 from each integer value in the input split by spaces. The input is taken from `raw_input().split()`, so the values in the list `p` will be one less than the input integers. The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each element being input integer - 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each element being input integer - 1**
