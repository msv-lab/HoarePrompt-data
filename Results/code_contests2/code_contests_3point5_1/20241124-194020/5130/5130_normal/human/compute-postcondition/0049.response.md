Output State: **If n is greater than 1 and there exists a valid sequence of indices according to p such that comps[p[j]] is non-zero for all j, then the loop will update comps[j] to col until comps[p[j]] becomes non-zero. The final state will have comps[j] as col for all valid j. If comps[p[j]] is non-zero for all j initially, the loop will not execute. If there is no valid sequence of indices according to p, the loop may result in an infinite loop.**
