The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `p`, and `b`, then processes them to update the `comps` list based on certain conditions. It assigns unique values to elements in `comps` based on relationships defined by `p`. Finally, it prints a value that depends on the conditions met during the processing. The function does not accept any explicit parameters, as it reads input dynamically.
