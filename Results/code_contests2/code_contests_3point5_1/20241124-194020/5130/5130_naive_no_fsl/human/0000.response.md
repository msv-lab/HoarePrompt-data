Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. One potential case where the program fails is when the input sequence p is such that it forms a cycle with a length less than n. In this case, the program will not be able to ensure that every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 1 4 3
0 0 0 0
```
In this case, the permutation p forms a cycle of length 2, which means not every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements. However, the program will output 1, indicating that only one element in sequence b needs to be changed, which is incorrect.
