Correctness: **False**

The given program does not seem to correctly calculate the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed in the permutation and sequence in order for each skewer to visit each of the placements. The logic used in the program does not align with the problem description provided.

The program calculates the number of connected components in the permutation graph and then adds 1 if the sum of the sequence b is 0. This logic does not seem to address the actual problem requirements.

To verify the correctness of the program, consider the following case:

Input
```
3
2 3 1
0 0 0
```

Expected Output
```
1
```

In the given case, the program should output 1 as only one element in sequence b needs to be changed to ensure that each skewer visits each of the placements. However, the program may not produce the correct output for this case.

Hence, the correctness of the program is **False**.
