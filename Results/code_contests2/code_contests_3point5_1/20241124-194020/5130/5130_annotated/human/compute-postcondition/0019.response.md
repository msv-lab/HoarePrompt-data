Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop, `comps` will have been updated with `col` at index `j`, `col` will be 1, `i` will be 0, and `j` will be updated based on the new value of `p[j]`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop will not execute. Potential edge case: if `comps[p[j]]` is not 0 before the loop starts, the loop will not execute.**
