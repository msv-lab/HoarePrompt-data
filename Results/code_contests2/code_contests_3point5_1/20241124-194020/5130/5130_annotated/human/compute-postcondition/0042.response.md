According to the code, the loop will execute one more time if the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0` is met. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `comps[p[j]]` is a non-zero value, `i` is 2, `j` is set to the final value of `p[j]` after incrementing `col` by 1, `col` is 5, `comps[i]` is 4, `comps[j]` is 5. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `comps[p[j]]` needs to be set to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is set to the final value of `p[j]` after incrementing `col` by 1, `col` is 5, `comps[i]` is 4, `comps[j]` is 5**
