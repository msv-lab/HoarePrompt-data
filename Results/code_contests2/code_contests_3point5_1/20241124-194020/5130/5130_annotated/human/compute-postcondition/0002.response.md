Example Answer:
The code maps the input values to integers and stores them in list `b`. The initial state is that `n` is an input integer, and `p` is a list containing the elements of `n` after subtracting 1 from each element. After executing the code, `b` will contain the mapped input values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing the elements of `n` after subtracting 1 from each element, `b` contains the mapped input values.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing the elements of `n` after subtracting 1 from each element, `b` contains the mapped input values**
