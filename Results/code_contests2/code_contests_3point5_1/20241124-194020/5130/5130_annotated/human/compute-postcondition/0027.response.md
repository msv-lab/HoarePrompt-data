According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[p[j]]` is 0. So, to execute the loop one more time, the value of `comps[p[j]]` needs to be changed to a non-zero value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `comps[p[j]]` is a non-zero value, `i` is 1, `j` is the value of `p[j]`, `col` is 2, `comps[i]` is 2, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col` which is 2**
