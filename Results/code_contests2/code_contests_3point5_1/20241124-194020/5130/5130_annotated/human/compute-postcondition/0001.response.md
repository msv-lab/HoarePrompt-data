Example Answer:
The list comprehension iterates over the input values, subtracting 1 from each element and storing the results in a list `p`. Since the initial state only mentions `n` as an input integer, the output state will be: n is an input integer, p is a list containing the elements of n after subtracting 1 from each element.
Output State: **n is an input integer, p is a list containing the elements of n after subtracting 1 from each element**
