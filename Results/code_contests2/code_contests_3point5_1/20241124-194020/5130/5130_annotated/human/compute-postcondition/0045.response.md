According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[p[j]]` is 0. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments to the states.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is set to the final value of `p[j]` after incrementing `col` by 1, `col` is 5, `comps[i]` is 4, `comps[j]` is 5, `j` is updated to the final value of `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is 5**
