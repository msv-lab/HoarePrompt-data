Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `comps[p[j]]` is a non-zero value, `i` is 2, `j` is the final value of `p[j]`, `col` is 5, `comps[i]` is 4, `comps[j]` is 5. If the initial value of `comps[p[j]]` is non-zero, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, the loop updates comps with col values until comps[p[j]] is non-zero, setting j to the final value of p[j] after incrementing col by 1.***
