According to the code, the loop can execute again if `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[p[j]]` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `comps[p[j]]` needs to be adjusted to not equal 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `comps[p[j]]` is not equal to 0, `i` is 2, `j` is set to the final value of `p[j]` after incrementing `col` by 1, `col` is 5, `comps[i]` is 4, `comps[j]` is 5, `j` is updated to the final value of `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is 5, `comps[j]` is updated to 5**
