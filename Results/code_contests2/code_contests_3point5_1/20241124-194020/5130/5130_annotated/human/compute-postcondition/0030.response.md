According to the code, the loop will execute one more time if `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[p[j]]` is a non-zero value, so it needs to be adjusted to `comps[p[j]]` is 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is the new value of `p[j]`, `col` is 2, `comps[i]` is 2, `comps[j]` is 2**
