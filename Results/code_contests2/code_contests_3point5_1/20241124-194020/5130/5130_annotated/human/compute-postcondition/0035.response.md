Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `comps[p[j]]` is a non-zero value, `i` is 1, `j` is the final value of `p[j]`, `col` is 2, `comps[i]` is 2, `comps[j]` is 2. If `comps[i]` is initially 0, `col` is increased by 1 and `comps[i]` is updated to the new value of `col`. The variable `j` is then set to the final value of `p[j]`. The loop iterates until `comps[p[j]]` is non-zero, updating `j` and setting `comps[j]` to the same value as `comps[i]`.***
