Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values `n`, `p`, and `b` and processes them. It calculates the number of colors used in a coloring process based on the input values. If the number of colors used is 1, it adds 0; otherwise, it adds the total sum of `b` to the number of colors. The function prints the final result but does not explicitly return a value. It handles cases where `n` is greater than 0 and `comps[p[j]]` is 0, updating the `comps` list with unique color values.**
