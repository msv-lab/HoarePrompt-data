Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0 and `comps[p[j]]` is 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop, `comps` will be updated with values of `col` at specific indices, `col` will be the total number of unique values in `comps`, `i` will be the index of the current iteration, `j` will be the final index after traversing through `p[j]`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop will not execute. If `comps[p[j]]` is not 0 at the start of the loop, the loop will not execute.**
