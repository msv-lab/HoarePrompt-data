According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is the new value of `p[j]`, `col` is 2, `comps[i]` is 2, `comps[j]` is 2, and `comps[j]` is now assigned the value of `col`, which is 2. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted so that `comps[p[j]]` is now not equal to 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `comps[p[j]]` is not 0, `i` is 1, `j` is the new value of `p[j]`, `col` is 2, `comps[i]` is 2, `comps[j]` is 2, `comps[j]` is now assigned the value of `col`, which is 2**
