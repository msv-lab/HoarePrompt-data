According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `comps[p[j]]` is not 0, which means the loop cannot execute again. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to update `comps[p[j]]` to be equal to 0.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` contains elements of `n` after subtracting 1 from each element, `b` contains the mapped input values, `comps` has been updated with `col` at index `j`, `col` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is updated based on the new value of `p[j]`, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is now updated based on the new value of `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is 1**
