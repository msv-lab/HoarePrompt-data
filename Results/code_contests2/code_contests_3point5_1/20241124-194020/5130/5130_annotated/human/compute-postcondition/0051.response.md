According to the code, the loop can execute again if the initial value of `comps[p[j]]` is zero. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `comps[p[j]]` is a non-zero value, `i` is 2, `j` is the final value of `p[j]`, `col` is 5, `comps[i]` is 4, `comps[j]` is 5. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the initial value of `comps[p[j]]` needs to be adjusted to zero.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is the final value of `p[j]`, `col` is 5, `comps[i]` is 4, `comps[j]` is 5**
