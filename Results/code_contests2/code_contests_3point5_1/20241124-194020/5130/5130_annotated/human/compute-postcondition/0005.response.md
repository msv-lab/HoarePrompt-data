According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the variables that need to be adjusted are:
- `p` should contain elements of `n` after subtracting 1 from each element.
- `b` should contain the mapped input values.
- `comps` should be a list of `n` zeros.
- `col` should be 0.
- `i` should be set to 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` contains elements of `n` after subtracting 1 from each element, `b` contains the mapped input values, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 0, `i` is 0**
