Output State: **If the initial value of comps[p[j]] is non-zero, the loop will not execute. Otherwise, the loop will update comps to have col values until comps[p[j]] is non-zero. The final state will have n greater than 0, comps[p[j]] as a non-zero value, i as 2, j set to the final value of p[j] after incrementing col by 1, col as 5, comps[i] as 4, and comps[j] as 5.**
