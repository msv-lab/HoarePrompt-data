Example Answer:
The value of `a` is adjusted by subtracting `(b + 1) * v` from it. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `v` are unknown, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a` adjusted according to the conditions, `b` adjusted according to the conditions, `v`, `res` is 2.
Output State: **`k`, `a` adjusted according to the conditions, `b` adjusted according to the conditions, `v`, `res` is 2**
