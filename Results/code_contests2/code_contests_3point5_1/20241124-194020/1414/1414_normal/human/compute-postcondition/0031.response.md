Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, and `b` are adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated by subtracting `k * v` and `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)`. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is updated by subtracting `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is updated by subtracting `v` only. In all cases, `v` remains 2 and `res` remains 3.***
