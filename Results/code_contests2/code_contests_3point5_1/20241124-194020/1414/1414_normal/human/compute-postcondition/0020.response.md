Example Answer:
The value of `a` is decremented by `v`, where `v` is 2. The previous value of `a` is unknown, so the output state is: k, a adjusted according to the conditions, b adjusted according to the conditions, v, res is 2. 
Output State: **k, a adjusted according to the conditions, b adjusted according to the conditions, v, res is 2**
