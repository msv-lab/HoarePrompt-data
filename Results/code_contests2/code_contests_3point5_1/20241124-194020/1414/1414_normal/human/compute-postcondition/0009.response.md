Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value 0. The formula updates the value of `a` by subtracting `(b + 1) * v`, which in this case is `0 + 1 * v`. The previous value of `a` is unknown, so the output state is: `a` is updated to the value of a - v.
Output State: **`a` is updated to the value of a - v**
