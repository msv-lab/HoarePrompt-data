Postcondition: ***k, a, b, v, res are integers. If b >= k, a is adjusted by subtracting k multiplied by v, b is adjusted by subtracting k - 1, and all other variables remain unchanged as 2. If b > 0, a is adjusted by subtracting (b + 1) multiplied by v, b is set to 0, and all other variables remain unchanged as 2. If b is not greater than 0, a is adjusted by subtracting v, and all other variables remain unchanged as 2.***
