Postcondition: ***k, a, b, and v are positive integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000, and res is 1. If b >= k, a is updated to a - k * v, and b is updated to b - (k - 1). If b > 0 and b is less than k, a is updated to a - (b + 1) * v, and b is set to 0. If b is not greater than 0, then a is decreased by v.***
