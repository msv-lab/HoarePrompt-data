Example Answer:
The values of k, a, b, and v are assigned by unpacking the list generated by splitting the input. Since the input is not provided, the actual values of k, a, b, and v are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: k, a, b, and v are positive integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000.
Output State: **k, a, b, and v are positive integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000**
