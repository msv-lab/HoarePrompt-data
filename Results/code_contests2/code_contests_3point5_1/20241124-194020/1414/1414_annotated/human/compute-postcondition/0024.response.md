Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. Variable `a` is still greater than 0 after the modifications. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is increased by 1, `a` is still greater than 0.
Output State: **`res` is increased by 1, `a` is still greater than 0**
