Example Answer:
The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)`, and the previous values of `b`, `k`, and `v` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is increased by 1, `a` is updated by subtracting `k * v`, `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)`.
Output State: **`res` is increased by 1, `a` is updated by subtracting `k * v`, `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)`**
