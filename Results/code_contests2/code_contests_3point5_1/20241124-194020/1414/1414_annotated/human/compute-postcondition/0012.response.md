Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are input integers, `res` is 1. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is updated to the result of subtracting `(b + 1) * v` from the original `a`, and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is updated to `a - v`. In all cases, `b` is less than `k` and the program has executed without errors, ensuring the correctness of the final state of the variables.***
