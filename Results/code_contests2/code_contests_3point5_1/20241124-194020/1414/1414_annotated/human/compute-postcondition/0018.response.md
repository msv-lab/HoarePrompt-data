Example Answer: 
Variable `a` is updated by subtracting the result of `(b + 1) * v` from its current value. The values of `a`, `b`, and `v` are not specified in the initial state, so the final value of `a` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `res` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `res` is increased by 1**
