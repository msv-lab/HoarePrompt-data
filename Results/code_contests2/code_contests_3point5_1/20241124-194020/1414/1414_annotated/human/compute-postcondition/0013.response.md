Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are input integers, `res` is 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated by subtracting `k * v` from its original value, and `b` is set to `b - (k - 1)`. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, `a` is updated by subtracting `(b + 1) * v` from the original `a`, and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, `a` is updated to `a - v`. In all scenarios, `b` is less than `k` and the program runs without errors, guaranteeing the final state of the variables.***
