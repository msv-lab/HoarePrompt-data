Example Answer: 
Variable `b` is assigned the value of 0. The values of `res` and `a` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is increased by 1, `a` is still greater than 0, `b` is 0.
Output State: **`res` is increased by 1, `a` is still greater than 0, `b` is 0**
