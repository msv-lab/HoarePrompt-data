Example Answer: 
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting the product of `k` and `v` from it. The previous value of `a` is unknown, so the updated value after subtraction is unknown as well. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `res` is increased by 1, and `a` is updated by subtracting the product of `k` and `v`.
Output State: **variable `res` is increased by 1, and `a` is updated by subtracting the product of `k` and `v`**
