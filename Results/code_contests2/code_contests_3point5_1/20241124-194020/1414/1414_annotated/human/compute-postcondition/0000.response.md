Example Answer:
`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers using list comprehension. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are now determined by the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are assigned input integer values.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are assigned input integer values**
