The function `func` reads input values for integers k, a, b, and v. It then iterates a while loop, incrementing the variable `res` based on the conditions within the loop. The loop updates the values of `a` and `b` based on comparisons with `k`. The loop continues until `a` becomes less than or equal to 0. Finally, the function prints the value of `res`. The function does not explicitly return any value.
