Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the number of divisors `b` is less than the maximum number of sections in the box `k`. In this case, the program should still distribute the nuts into boxes without exceeding the capacity of each section. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3 10 1 3
```
The expected output should be `3` according to the problem description. However, the program does not provide the correct output for this case.
