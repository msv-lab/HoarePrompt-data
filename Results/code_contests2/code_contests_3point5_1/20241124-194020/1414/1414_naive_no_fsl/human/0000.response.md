Correctness: False

The provided program is incorrect. The issue lies in the logic used to update the values of 'a' and 'b' within the while loop. The program does not handle the cases where the number of nuts 'a' is not a multiple of the capacity of the sections 'v' properly. This can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.

For example, consider the input:
3 10 3 3

The correct output should be 2, however, the program will output 3. This is because the program does not consider the case where the number of nuts cannot be evenly distributed among the sections of the box.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
