The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It initializes a constant `MOD`, takes an input `n`, and creates a list `a` based on the input values. It then initializes a 2D array `dp` and populates it based on specific conditions. Finally, it prints the value at a specific index in the `dp` array. The function does not explicitly return any value. Potential edge cases and missing functionality include the validation of input `n` to ensure it falls within the range 1 <= n <= 21 and the handling of invalid inputs for list `a`.
