According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than n + 1. This means that `j` can still be incremented by 1 and the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: `n` is greater than 0, `mask` ranges from 1 to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are appropriately initialized, `j` is less than n + 2.
