According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `j` is less than n**
