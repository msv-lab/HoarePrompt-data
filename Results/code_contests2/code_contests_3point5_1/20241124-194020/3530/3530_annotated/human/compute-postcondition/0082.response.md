According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` ranges from 1 to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are appropriately initialized, and `j` is less than `n`. Since `j` is the iterating variable, it needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` ranges from 1 to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are appropriately initialized, `j` is less than n + 1**
