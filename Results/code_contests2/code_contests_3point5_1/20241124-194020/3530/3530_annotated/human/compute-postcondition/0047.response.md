According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is 1 << n, `a` is a 2D list, `j` has been incremented. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n + 1` since it is incremented in each iteration.
State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is 1 << n, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is less than `n + 1`**
