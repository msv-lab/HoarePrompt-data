Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mask` ranges from 1 to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are appropriately initialized, `j` is less than n + 1. If the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is satisfied, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the result modulo MOD. This postcondition covers all possible cases and ensures the proper functioning of the program fragment.***
