Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous values of `mask`, `j`, `n`, `a`, and `dp` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is one more than the previous value, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulo operation with `MOD`.
Output State: **`mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is one more than the previous value, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulo operation with `MOD`**
