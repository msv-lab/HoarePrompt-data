Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is a positive integer, and other relevant states are updated based on the conditions in the loop body. 
Output State: **The next `mask` value for the next iteration is updated to have `j+1` as 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` is a positive integer, and other relevant states are updated based on the conditions in the loop body**
