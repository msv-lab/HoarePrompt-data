According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is the input value + 2, and `a` contains the appended elements from the input. To execute the loop one more time, `_` should be incremented by 1 and `n` should be incremented by 1 as well.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is the input value + 3, `a` contains the appended elements from the input.**
