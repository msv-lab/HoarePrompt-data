According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **mask is the value at the end, j is the last value in the range, n is greater than 1, a is a list of lists, and dp[i][mask] is updated accordingly**
