Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value at index `n` of the dp array where the index is calculated as `(1 << n) - 1`. If the loop has updated the dp array based on specific conditions, then the printed value will reflect those changes. If the loop did not execute, the dp array remains unchanged.
Output State: **The value at index `n` of the dp array is printed**
