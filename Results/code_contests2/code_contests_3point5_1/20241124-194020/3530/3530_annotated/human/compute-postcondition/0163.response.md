Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of the current value with `MOD`. The variables `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `MOD` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: The next `mask` value for the next iteration is updated to have `j` as 1, where `n` is a positive integer.
Output State: **The next `mask` value for the next iteration is updated to have `j` as 1, where `n` is a positive integer**
