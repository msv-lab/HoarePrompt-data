According to the code, the loop will execute for all values of `mask` from 1 to 2^n-1. At the end of the last iteration, the loop updated the dp array based on certain conditions. If the conditions are met, the dp array is updated. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration. Since the loop started at 1 and goes up to 2^n-1, the next `mask` value should be the one after the last iteration.
State: **Adjust `mask` to the next value after the last iteration**
