Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `mask`, `a`, `dp`, and `j` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `mask` starts from 1 and goes up to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are initialized with appropriate values, `j` starts from 0 and goes up to n-1. The element at index i-1 and j of array a is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` starts from 1 and goes up to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are initialized with appropriate values, `j` starts from 0 and goes up to n-1. The element at index i-1 and j of array a is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set**
