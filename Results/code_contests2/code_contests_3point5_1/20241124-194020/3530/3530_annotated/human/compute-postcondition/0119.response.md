Output State: 
- If `n` is greater than 0 and the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are met for at least one iteration, then after the loop executes, `mask` is the value at the end of the last iteration, `j` is the last value in the range, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of lists. The variable `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and there is no change in the variables `mask`, `j`, `a`, and `dp`.
- If the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` is never satisfied for any iteration, then after the loop executes, `mask` is the value at the end of the last iteration, `j` is the last value in the range, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of lists. However, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.
