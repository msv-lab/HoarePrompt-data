Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo MOD. The values of `i` and `mask` are known, but the actual values are not provided. So, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, and `j` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, and `j` is 1**
