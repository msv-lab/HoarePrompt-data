Postcondition: ***a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, j is incremented to the next value within the range. After the execution of the if statement, dp[i][mask] is updated to be the remainder of its current value divided by MOD while maintaining the conditions on a[i - 1][0], mask, j, and a[i - 1][j].***
