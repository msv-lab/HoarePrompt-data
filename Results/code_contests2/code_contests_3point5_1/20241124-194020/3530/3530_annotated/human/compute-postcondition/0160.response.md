Postcondition: ***The next `mask` value for the next iteration is updated to have `j` as 0, where `n` is a positive integer. If the element at index `i - 1` and `j` in list `a` is 1, and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. All edge cases are appropriately handled to maintain the integrity of the program state.***
