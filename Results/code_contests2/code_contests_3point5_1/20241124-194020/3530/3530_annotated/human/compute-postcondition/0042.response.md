Postcondition: ***`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is 1 << n, `a` is a 2D list. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo of `MOD`. This postcondition covers all cases where the conditions are met and ensures the validity of the updated values in `dp`.***
