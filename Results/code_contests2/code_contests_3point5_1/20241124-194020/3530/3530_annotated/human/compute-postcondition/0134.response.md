Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of the variables are as follows: `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists. Without knowing the exact values of `dp`, it can be concluded that `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is affected by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
Output State: **`mask` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is affected by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
