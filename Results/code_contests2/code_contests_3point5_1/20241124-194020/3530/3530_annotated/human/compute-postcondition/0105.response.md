According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `mask` is the next value after the last iteration does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 0 and `mask` is the value at the end of the last iteration. 
State: **`mask` is the value at the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists**
