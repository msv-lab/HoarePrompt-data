According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` in the range of `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the next `mask` value for the next iteration is updated based on the value of `j`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `mask` value needs to be updated to the next value in the range of `1` to `1 << n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The next `mask` value for the next iteration is updated based on the value of `j`**
