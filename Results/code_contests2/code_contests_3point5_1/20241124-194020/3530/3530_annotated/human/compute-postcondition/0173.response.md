According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute. At the end of the previous iteration, the output state remains the same as the loop did not execute. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **Output State**
