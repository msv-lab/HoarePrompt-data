According to the code, the loop executes for all values of `mask` in the range [1, 1 << n). The loop updates the `dp` array based on specific conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask & 1 << j`. If the conditions are met for any `j` value, the `dp` array is updated with the calculation `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] % MOD`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has covered all possible combinations of conditions for the variables involved.

To execute the loop one more time, the next `mask` value must be considered. Since the loop increments `mask` by 1 in each iteration, the next `mask` value should be calculated. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment for the next iteration is the `mask` value.

State: **The next `mask` value for the next iteration**
