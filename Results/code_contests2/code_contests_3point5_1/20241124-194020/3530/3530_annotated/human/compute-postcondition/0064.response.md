Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are known, so we can calculate the result. Since `dp` is a 2D list, it will be updated accordingly. 
Output State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the updated values, `mask` is updated to `mask + 1`, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is 2**
