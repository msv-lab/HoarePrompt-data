Postcondition: ***`mask` is the value at the end of the last iteration, `j` equals 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo MOD. Various edge cases are covered, including the conditions for `mask`, `j`, `n`, and the values in `a`, ensuring that the program updates `dp` correctly after executing the if statement.***
