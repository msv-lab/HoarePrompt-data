Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of its current value divided by MOD. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are not given, so the output state is: a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, j is incremented to the next value within the range, `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of its current value divided by MOD.
Output State: **a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, j is incremented to the next value within the range, `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of its current value divided by MOD**
