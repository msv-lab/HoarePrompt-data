Output State: 
- `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is 1 << n, `a` is a 2D list.
- If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo of `MOD`.
- The loop will execute for each value of `j` in the range of `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated accordingly.
- If the conditions in the loop are not met, the loop will not execute, leaving the variables unchanged.
