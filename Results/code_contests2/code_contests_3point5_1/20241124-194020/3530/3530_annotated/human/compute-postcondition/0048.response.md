Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, `dp`, and `j` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is 1 << n, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is less than `n + 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated according to the calculation.
Output State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is 1 << n, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is less than `n + 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated**
