According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2 for the condition `j < n` to hold true.
State: **`mask` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists**
