Output State: **`mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists. If the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` is true for any `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo MOD. All other variables and lists remain unchanged. If the loop does not execute, all variables retain their initial values.**
