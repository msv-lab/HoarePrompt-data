According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is one more than the previous value, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by one more, so `j` should be `j + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is the previous value plus 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists**
