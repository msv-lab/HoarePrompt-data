Postcondition: ***`mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is one more than the previous value, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. This update occurs under the condition that `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true.***
