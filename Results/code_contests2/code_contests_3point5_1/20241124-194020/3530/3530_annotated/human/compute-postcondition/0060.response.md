Example Answer:
The value at index [i][mask] in the 2D list `dp` is updated by adding the value at index [i-1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, `dp`, and `j` are provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the updated value at index [i][mask], `mask` is updated to `mask + 1`, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, updated `dp` with the new value at index [i][mask], `mask` is updated to `mask + 1`, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is 1**
