According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0`, `mask` is in the range [1, 1 << n), `j` is in the range [0, n), `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j`. After the execution of the if statement, `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of its current value divided by MOD while maintaining the conditions on `a[i - 1][0]`, `mask`, `j`, and `a[i - 1][j]`. Since `j` is incremented to the next value within the range, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value within the range. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0`, `mask` is in the range [1, 1 << n), `j` is in the range [0, n), `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j`, `j` is the next value within the range**
