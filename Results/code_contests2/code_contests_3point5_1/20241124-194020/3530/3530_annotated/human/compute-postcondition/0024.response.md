Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `j` is 0. The element at index `(i-1, j)` in 2D list `a` is 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 shifted left by `j` is true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
