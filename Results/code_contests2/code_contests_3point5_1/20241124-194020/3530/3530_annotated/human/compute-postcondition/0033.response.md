Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of its current value. The modulo operation does not change the state of any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `j` is less than n, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `j` is less than n, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation**
