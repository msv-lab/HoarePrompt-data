According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `mask`, `j`, `n`, `a` are as described in the precondition. If the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` is satisfied, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated. So for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that the condition `a[i][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` is satisfied.
State: **`mask`, `j + 1`, `n`, `a` where `a[i][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`**
