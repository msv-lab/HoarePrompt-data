According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` starts from 1 and goes up to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are initialized with appropriate values, `j` starts from 0 and goes up to n-1. Since `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` starts from 1 and goes up to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are initialized with appropriate values, `j` is less than n**
