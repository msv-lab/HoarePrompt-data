According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since the initial state provided is the next `mask` value for the next iteration, we need to adjust it so that `j` starts from 0 and `n` is greater than 0.
State: **The next `mask` value for the next iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
