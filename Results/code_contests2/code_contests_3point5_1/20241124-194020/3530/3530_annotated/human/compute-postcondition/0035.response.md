According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `j` is less than `n`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `j` is the next value after the current value of `j` less than `n**`.
