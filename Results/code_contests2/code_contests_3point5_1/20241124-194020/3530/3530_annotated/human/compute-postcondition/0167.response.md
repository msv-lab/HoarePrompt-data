Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to have the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` by `MOD`. The states of `mask` and `j` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: The next `mask` value for the next iteration is updated to have `j+1` as 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` is a positive integer, and other relevant states are updated based on the conditions in the loop body.
Output State: **The next `mask` value for the next iteration is updated to have `j+1` as 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` is a positive integer, and other relevant states are updated based on the conditions in the loop body**
