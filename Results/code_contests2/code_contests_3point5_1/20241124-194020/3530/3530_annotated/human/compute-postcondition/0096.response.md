Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. The previous values of variables are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists.
Output State: **`mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists**
