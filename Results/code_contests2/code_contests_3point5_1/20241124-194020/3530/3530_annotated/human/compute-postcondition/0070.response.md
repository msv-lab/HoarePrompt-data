Output State: The loop iterates through all possible values of `mask` from 1 to 1 << n. For each `mask`, it checks if the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` is true for all `j` in the range of `n`. If the condition is met, it updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and applying the modulo operation by `MOD`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` remains greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.
