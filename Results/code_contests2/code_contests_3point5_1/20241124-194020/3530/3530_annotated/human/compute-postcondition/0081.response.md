Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mask` ranges from 1 to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are appropriately initialized, `j` is less than n. If the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is satisfied, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the result modulo MOD. This process handles all possible combinations of `i`, `mask`, and `j`, ensuring that the dp array is correctly updated in each iteration.***
