According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1. To execute one more time, the `mask` value needs to be adjusted. Since the loop is currently at `mask in range(1, 1 << n)`, for the next iteration, `mask` should be `1 << n` to include the upper limit.
State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is `1 << n`**
