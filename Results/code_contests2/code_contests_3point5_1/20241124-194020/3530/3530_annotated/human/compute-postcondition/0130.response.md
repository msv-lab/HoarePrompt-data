Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided, so the exact values cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the formula.
Output State: **`mask` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the formula**
