Postcondition: ***n remains greater than 0, i is 2, dp is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, mask is 1 << n, a is a 2D list, j is less than n + 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask has jth bit set, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the result modulo MOD.***
