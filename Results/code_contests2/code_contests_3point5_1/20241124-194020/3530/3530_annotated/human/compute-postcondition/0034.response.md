Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `j` is less than n. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo operation. The modulo operation is performed on `dp[i][mask]`.***
