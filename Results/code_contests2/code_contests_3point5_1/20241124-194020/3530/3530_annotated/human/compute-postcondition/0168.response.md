Postcondition: ***The next `mask` value for the next iteration is updated to have `j+1` as 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` is a positive integer, and other relevant states are updated based on the conditions in the loop body. If a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and 1 shifted left by `j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo MOD. All other variables and states remain consistent with the given conditions, handling all necessary edge cases.***
