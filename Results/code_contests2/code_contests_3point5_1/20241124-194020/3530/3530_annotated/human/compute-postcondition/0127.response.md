Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with MOD. The previous values of the variables are not directly affecting the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with MOD.
Output State: **`mask` is 1, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with MOD**
