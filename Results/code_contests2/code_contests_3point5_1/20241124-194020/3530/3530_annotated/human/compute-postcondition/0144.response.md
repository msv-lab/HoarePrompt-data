Postcondition: ***a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j. After the execution of the if statement, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taking the modulo operation with MOD. This operation covers all possible combinations of the given conditions and ensures the correctness of the program state.***
