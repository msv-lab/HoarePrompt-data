According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than `n`. Before the loop starts, the initial state does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is updated to `mask + 1`, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is 0**
