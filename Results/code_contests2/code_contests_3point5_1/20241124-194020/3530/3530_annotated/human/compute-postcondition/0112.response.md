Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. Since the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is unknown, we can simply state that `dp[i][mask]` is updated according to the modulo operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `mask` is the value at the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo operation.
Output State: **`mask` is the value at the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo operation**
