Postcondition: ***`mask` is 1, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` results in a non-zero value, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo with MOD.***
