Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulo MOD. This operation does not change the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, mask is adjusted to cover the range properly, j is incremented to consider the next value, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, mask is adjusted to cover the range properly, j is incremented to consider the next value, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula provided**
