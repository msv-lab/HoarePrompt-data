According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is 1, and `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1. To ensure the loop executes, `j` needs to be set to 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `j` is 0**
