Postcondition: ***`mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists. If the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is true, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the result modulo MOD. All other variables remain unchanged.***
