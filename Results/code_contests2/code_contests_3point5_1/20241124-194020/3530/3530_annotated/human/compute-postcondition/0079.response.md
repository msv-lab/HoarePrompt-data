Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `mask`, `a`, `dp`, and `j` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `mask` starts from 1 and goes up to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are initialized with appropriate values, `j` is less than n.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` starts from 1 and goes up to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are initialized with appropriate values, `j` is less than n**
