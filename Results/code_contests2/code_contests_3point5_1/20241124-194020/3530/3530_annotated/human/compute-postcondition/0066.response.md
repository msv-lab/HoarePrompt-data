Postcondition: ***`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `mask` is updated to `mask + 1`, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then modulo `MOD` is applied. The state of the program after the execution is as follows: `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the updated values, `mask` is updated to `mask + 1`, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is 2.***
