Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variables `i`, `mask`, `j` are used in the calculation, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `mask` ranges from 1 to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are appropriately initialized, `j` is less than n + 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` ranges from 1 to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are appropriately initialized, `j` is less than n + 1**
