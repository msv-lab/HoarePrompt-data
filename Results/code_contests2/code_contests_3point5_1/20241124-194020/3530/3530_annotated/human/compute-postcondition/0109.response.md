Postcondition: ***`mask` is the value at the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.***
