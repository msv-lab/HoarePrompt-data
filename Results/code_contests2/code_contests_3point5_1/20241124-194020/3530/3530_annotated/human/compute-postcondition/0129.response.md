According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 1. `n` being greater than 1 ensures that the loop will execute again, so no adjustment needed for `n`. Since `j` is 0, to execute one more time `j` needs to be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`mask` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists**
