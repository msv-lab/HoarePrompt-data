According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, and `j` is 1**
