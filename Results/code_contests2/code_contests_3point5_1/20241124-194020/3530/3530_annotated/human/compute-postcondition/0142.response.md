Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The initial conditions state that `a[i - 1][0] == 1`, `mask & 1 << 0`, `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, and `mask & 1 << j`. Since we are dealing with bitwise operations, the specific values of `mask` and `j` are not provided, but the logic of the operation remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: *a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j
Output State: **a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j**
