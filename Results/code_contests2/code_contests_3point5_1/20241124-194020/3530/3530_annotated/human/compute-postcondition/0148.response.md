Postcondition: ***a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, mask is adjusted to cover the range properly, j is incremented to consider the next value. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the modulus by MOD. This process considers the conditions for all valid values of j and mask within the specified ranges, ensuring proper coverage and updating of the dp array.***
