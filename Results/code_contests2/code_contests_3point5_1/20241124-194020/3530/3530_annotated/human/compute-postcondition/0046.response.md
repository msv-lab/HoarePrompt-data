Postcondition: ***`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is 1 << n, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is incremented. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo MOD. Various edge cases are handled, including `n` remaining greater than 0, `i` being 2, `dp` being a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` being 1 << n, `a` being a 2D list, `j` being incremented, and the calculation updating `dp[i][mask]` correctly.***
