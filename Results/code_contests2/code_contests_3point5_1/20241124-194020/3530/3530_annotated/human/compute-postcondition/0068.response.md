Output State: **The loop iterates over the elements in the `j` range from 0 to `n-1`. If the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` holds true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and applying the modulo operation by `MOD`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` remains greater than 0 and there are elements left in the range. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.**
