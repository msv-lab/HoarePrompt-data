Postcondition: ***`mask`, `j`, `n`, `a` are as described in the precondition. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and applying the modulo operation. This update occurs after the last iteration. No changes are made to the other variables.***
