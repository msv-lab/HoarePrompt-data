Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, and `j` is 0. If the element at index (i-1, j) in 2D list `a` is 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 shifted left by `j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. All other variables and conditions remain the same.***
