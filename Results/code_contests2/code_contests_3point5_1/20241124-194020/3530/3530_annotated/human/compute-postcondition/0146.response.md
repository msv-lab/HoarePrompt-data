Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp` are unknown, and the values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are within specific ranges. Therefore, the output state is: a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, mask is adjusted to cover the range properly, j is incremented to consider the next value, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, mask is adjusted to cover the range properly, j is incremented to consider the next value, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula provided**
