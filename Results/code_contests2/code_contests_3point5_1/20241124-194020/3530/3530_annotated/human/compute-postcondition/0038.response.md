According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is 1, which does not affect the loop execution. The `dp` 2D list with the first row initialized to 1 and `mask` as `1 << n` also do not affect the loop execution. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is `1 << n`**
