Output State: **`mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is one less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0. `a` is a list of lists. The value at index `i-1` and `j` in list `a` is 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1. `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
