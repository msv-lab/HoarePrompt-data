Postcondition: ***The next `mask` value for the next iteration is updated to have `j` as 1, where `n` is a positive integer. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND operation with 1 left shifted by `j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the remainder when divided by MOD.***
