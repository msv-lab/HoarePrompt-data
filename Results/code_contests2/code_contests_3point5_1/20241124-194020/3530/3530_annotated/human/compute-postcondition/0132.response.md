Postcondition: ***`mask` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists. If the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` is satisfied, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] % MOD`. This update occurs while maintaining the initial values of `mask`, `j`, `n`, and `a`.***
