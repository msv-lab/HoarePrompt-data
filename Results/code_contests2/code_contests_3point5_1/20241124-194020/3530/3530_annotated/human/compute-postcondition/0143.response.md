Example Answer:
The code snippet `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` calculates the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` with respect to `MOD`. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `MOD` are not explicitly given, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j.
Output State: **a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j**
