Output State: **If the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` is met, then `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo operation with MOD. The loop will execute for all values of j in the range [0, n) as long as the initial conditions are met. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the result of the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is zero, then the loop will not execute and no updates will be made to `dp[i][mask]`.**
