According to the code, the loop will execute for all values of `mask` in the range [1, 1 << n). At the end of the last iteration, the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` is met. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the range of `mask` needs to be adjusted to [1, 1 << n) and the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` needs to be met again.
State: **If the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` is met, then `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo operation with MOD. The loop will execute for all values of `mask` in the range [1, 1 << n).**
