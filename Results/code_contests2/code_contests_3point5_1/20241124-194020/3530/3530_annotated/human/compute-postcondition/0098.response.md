According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0. The conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are not given in the current state, so they will not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is one more than the previous value, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists**
