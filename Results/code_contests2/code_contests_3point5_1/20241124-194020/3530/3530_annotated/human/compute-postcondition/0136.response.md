Postcondition: ***`mask` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo operation. This condition covers all cases where the variables maintain their initial values, and the calculation of `dp[i][mask]` is determined by the mentioned logic, ensuring the proper functioning of the program fragment.***
