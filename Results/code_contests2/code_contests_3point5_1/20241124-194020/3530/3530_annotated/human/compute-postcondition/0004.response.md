Example Answer: 
The statement appends the result of map(int, raw_input().split()) to list `a`. The input is taken and split into multiple integers, then converted to integers using map. The list `a` accumulates these elements after each iteration. Since we don't have specific values for `n` and the input, the output state after this operation is: MOD is 1000000007, `n` is the input value, and `a` contains the appended elements from the input.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is the input value, `a` contains the appended elements from the input**
