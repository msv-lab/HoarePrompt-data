Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is 1 << n, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is incremented, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
Output State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is 1 << n, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is incremented, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
