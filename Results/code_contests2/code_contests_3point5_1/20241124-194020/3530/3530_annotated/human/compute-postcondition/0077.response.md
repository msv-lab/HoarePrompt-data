Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mask` starts from 1 and goes up to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are initialized with appropriate values, `j` starts from 0 and goes up to n-1. If the element at index i-1 and j of array a is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the result modulo MOD. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases for the given program fragment.***
