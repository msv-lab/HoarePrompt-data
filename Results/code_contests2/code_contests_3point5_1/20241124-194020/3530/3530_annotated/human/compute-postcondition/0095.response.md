Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists.
Output State: **`mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists**
