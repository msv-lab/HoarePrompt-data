According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are set as follows: *a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted to consider the next value of `j` within the specified range. Therefore, the state needs to be modified as follows:
State: *a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0, mask is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n), a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, j is incremented to the next value within the range*
