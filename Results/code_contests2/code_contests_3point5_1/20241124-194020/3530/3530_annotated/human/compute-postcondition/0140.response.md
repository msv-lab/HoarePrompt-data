According to the code, the loop can execute for all values of `j` in the range [0, n). Before the loop starts, the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` must be satisfied for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0`. Additionally, since the loop will execute for all values of `mask` in the range [1, 1 << n), the state should include `mask` being in that range.
State: **`a[i - 1][0] == 1 and mask & 1 << 0`, `mask` is in the range [1, 1 << n), j is in the range [0, n)**
