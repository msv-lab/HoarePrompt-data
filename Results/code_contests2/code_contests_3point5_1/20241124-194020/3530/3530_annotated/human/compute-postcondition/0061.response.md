Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulus with MOD. The previous values of i, mask, and MOD are not provided, so we can't calculate the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: n remains greater than 0, i is 1, updated dp with the new value at index [i][mask], mask is updated to mask + 1, a is a 2D list, j is 1.
Output State: **n remains greater than 0, i is 1, updated dp with the new value at index [i][mask], mask is updated to mask + 1, a is a 2D list, j is 1**
