According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since we need to adjust `mask` to the next value after the last iteration, the state needs to be modified to `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is one less than the value of `n`.
State: **`mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is one less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0**
