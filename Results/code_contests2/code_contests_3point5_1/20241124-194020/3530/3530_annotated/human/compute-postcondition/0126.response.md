Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i - 1][mask]`, `mask`, and `j` are needed to calculate the result. Since those values are not provided, the output state is: `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`mask` is 1, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists, `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly**
