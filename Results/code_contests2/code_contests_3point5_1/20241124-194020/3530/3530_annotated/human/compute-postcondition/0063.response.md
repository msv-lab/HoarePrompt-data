According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is updated to `mask + 1`, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is updated to `mask + 1`, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is 2**
