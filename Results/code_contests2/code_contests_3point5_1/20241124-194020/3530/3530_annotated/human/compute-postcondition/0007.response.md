According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is the input value + 1, `a` contains the appended elements from the input. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` should be incremented by 1, and `n` should be updated to input value + 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is the input value + 2, `a` contains the appended elements from the input**
