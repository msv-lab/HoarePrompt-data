Output State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is 1 << n, `a` is a 2D list. The element at index (i-1, j) in a is equal to 1, and the jth bit of mask is set to 1. `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
