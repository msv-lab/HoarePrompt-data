According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is one less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n` in the next iteration.
State: **`mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists**.
