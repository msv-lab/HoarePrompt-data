Postcondition: ***`mask` is the next value after the last iteration, `j` is one less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of lists. If the value at index `i-1` and `j` in list `a` is 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taken modulo MOD. All other variables and lists remain unchanged.***
