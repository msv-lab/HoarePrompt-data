According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, the loop iterates over the range of `n`, so the loop will execute `n` times. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mask` starts from 1 and goes up to 1 << n, `a` and `dp` arrays are initialized with appropriate values, `j` starts from 0 and goes up to n-1**
