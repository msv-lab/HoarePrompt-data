Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, `j`, and the elements of `dp` are not provided, so the exact result cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, and `j` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, and `j` is 1**
