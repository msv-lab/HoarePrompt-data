Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `n` is a positive integer, and the specific values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided, so the output state is: The next `mask` value for the next iteration is updated to have `j` as 1, where `n` is a positive integer.
Output State: **The next `mask` value for the next iteration is updated to have `j` as 1, where `n` is a positive integer**
