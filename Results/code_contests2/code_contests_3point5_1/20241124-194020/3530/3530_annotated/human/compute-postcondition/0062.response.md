Postcondition: ***`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with the first row initialized to 1, `mask` is updated to `mask + 1`, `a` is a 2D list, `j` is 1. If the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j holds true, then the value at dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value at dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the result modulo MOD. This calculation happens while ensuring the original conditions of the variables remain unchanged.***
