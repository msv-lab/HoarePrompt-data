According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, mask is 1, `j` is the last value in the range, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `j` needs to be set to the first value in the range, which is 0.
State: **`mask` is 1, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of lists, `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly**
