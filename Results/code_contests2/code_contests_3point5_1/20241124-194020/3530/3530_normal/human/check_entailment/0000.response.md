Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an input integer `n` and processes `n` lines of input data, each containing `n` integers (0 or 1) separated by spaces. This aligns with the problem description where the compatibility matrix of men and women is provided.
- It creates a matrix `dp` of size `(n+1) x (2^n)` to store the number of ways Taro can make pairs.
- The code iterates through different combinations of pairs using bit manipulation and updates the `dp` matrix accordingly based on the compatibility values.
- Finally, it prints the number of ways Taro can make pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7, which is stored at `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1`.
- The code ensures that it handles cases where `n` is 0 or negative, preventing the loop from executing in those scenarios.

Overall, the code implementation aligns with the problem description and correctly calculates the number of ways Taro can make pairs given the compatibility matrix.
