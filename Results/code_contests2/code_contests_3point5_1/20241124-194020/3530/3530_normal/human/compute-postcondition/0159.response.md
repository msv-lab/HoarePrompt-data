Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulo `MOD`. Since the value of `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, the output state after running the code is the same as before with the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`.
Output State: **`j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The value of a[i - 1][j] is 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` after taking modulo `MOD`.**
