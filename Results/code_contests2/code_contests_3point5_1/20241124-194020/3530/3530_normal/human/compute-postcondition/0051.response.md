According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than n+1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **After the if block executes, the `dp` matrix is updated based on loop conditions, `mask` is initialized or updated, `a` is initialized or updated, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is less than n+1.**
