Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of its current value by MOD. The other variables remain the same as before. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated based on the conditions within the loop, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`, `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is within the range of `(0, n)`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus by MOD.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated based on the conditions within the loop, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`, `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is within the range of `(0, n)`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus by MOD**
