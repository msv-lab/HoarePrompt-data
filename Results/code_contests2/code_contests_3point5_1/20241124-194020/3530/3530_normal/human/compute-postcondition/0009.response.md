According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `_`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 1, and a new list of integers has been appended to `a` after mapping the input values to integers. The state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `_` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, a new list of integers is appended to `a` after mapping the input values to integers, `_` is less than `n+1**.
