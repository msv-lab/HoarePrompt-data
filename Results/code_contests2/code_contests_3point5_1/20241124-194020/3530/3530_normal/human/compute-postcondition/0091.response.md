Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`, `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is within the range of `(0, n)`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1. Therefore, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` is calculated based on the previous values of `dp` array elements and the specific conditions mentioned.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated based on the conditions within the loop, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`, `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is within the range of `(0, n)`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1**
