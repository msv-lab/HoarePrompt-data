According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `mask` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the previous iteration, if `n` is greater than 0, the loop executed, so `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If n is greater than 0, the dp matrix is updated based on the loop conditions with respect to mask, a, and n**
