Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the dp matrix is updated based on the loop conditions with respect to mask, a, and n. 'j' is 2, 'n' is greater than 0. If the element at position 'i - 1' in the matrix 'a' is 1 and the 'j-th' bit of 'mask' is set to 1, then the element at position 'i' in the dp matrix with 'mask' is incremented by the value at position 'i-1' in the dp matrix with 'mask' xor 1 shifted left by 'j'. The updated value is then taken modulo MOD. This update covers all scenarios for the given conditions and ensures the correctness of the dp matrix after the execution of the if statement.**
