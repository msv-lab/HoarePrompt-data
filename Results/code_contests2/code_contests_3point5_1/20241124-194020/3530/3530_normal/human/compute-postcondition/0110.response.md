According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is 1**
