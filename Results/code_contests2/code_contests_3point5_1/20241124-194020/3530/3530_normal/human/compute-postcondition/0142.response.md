Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are unknown, so the output state is: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the element at index `i-1` of list `a` is 1, and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1.
Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the element at index `i-1` of list `a` is 1, and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1**
