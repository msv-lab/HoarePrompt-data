Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified by taking its modulus with `MOD`. Since the previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, `a`, `n`, and `j` are not mentioned, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is 0**
