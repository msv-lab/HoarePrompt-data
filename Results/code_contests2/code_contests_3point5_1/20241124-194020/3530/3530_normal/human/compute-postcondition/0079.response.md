Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variables `i`, `a`, `n`, and `j` are not affected. The output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated, `a` is specified, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated, `a` is specified, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
