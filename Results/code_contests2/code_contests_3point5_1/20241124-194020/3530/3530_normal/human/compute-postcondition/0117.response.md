Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then the result is taken modulo MOD. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.***
