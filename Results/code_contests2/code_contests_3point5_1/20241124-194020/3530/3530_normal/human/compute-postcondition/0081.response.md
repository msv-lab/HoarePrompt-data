Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated, `a` is specified, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND operation with `1 << j` returns true, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and modulo by MOD is applied to `dp[i][mask]`. All other conditions remain unchanged.***
