According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the state `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the specified conditions. If `a[i - 1][2]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the 2nd bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << 2]` and computed modulo MOD.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` remains unchanged
- `mask` needs to have the 2nd bit set in order for the condition to be met
- `n` remains unchanged

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with respect to the specified conditions, `i` is unchanged, `mask` has the 2nd bit set, `n` is unchanged**
