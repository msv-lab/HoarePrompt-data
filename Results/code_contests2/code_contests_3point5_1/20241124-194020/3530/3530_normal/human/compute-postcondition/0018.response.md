According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 0. The next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1 to proceed to the next value of `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, a new list of integers is appended to `a` after mapping the input values to integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (2^n) initialized with 0, `i` is 3, `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1**
