According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `j` is within the range of `(0, n)`. If the conditions are met, the loop will execute again with an updated `mask`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `j` is within the range of `(0, n)`**
