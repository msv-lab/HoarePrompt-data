Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If the element at index `i-1` of list `a` is 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is then taken modulo `MOD`. This covers all cases where the conditions of the if statement are met, ensuring the proper update of `dp[i][mask]` based on the previous state of the program variables.***
