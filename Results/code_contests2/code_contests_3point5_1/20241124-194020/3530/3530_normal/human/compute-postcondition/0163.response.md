Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of its current value divided by MOD. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are not provided, so the exact result cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
