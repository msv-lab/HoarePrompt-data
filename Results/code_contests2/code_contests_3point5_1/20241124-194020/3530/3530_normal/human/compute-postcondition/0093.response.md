Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated based on the conditions within the loop. `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `j` is within the range of `(0, n)`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulus by MOD. All possible edge cases and conditions have been handled within the if statement.***
