Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: *`n` is greater than 0. The value at position `(i-1, j)` in matrix `a` is 1 and the bit at position `j` is set in `mask`, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by an unknown value based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0. The value at position `(i-1, j)` in matrix `a` is 1 and the bit at position `j` is set in `mask`, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by an unknown value based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
