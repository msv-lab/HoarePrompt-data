Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and then taking the modulus of `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, `a`, `mask`, `n`, and `j` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated based on the conditions within the loop, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `j` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated based on the conditions within the loop, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `j` is less than `n`.**
