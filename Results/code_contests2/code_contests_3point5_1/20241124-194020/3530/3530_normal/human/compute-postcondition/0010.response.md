Output State: **If n is greater than 0, then MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than or equal to n, a is a list with at least n elements, and a new list of integers is appended to a after mapping the input values to integers. If n is less than or equal to 0, then MOD is 1000000007, n is less than or equal to 0, a is an empty list, and the loop does not execute.**
