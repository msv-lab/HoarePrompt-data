Output State: **After the loop executes, `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo `MOD`. This logic covers all possible scenarios and edge cases where `j` is within the specified range, `n` is valid, and the conditions for updating `dp[i][mask]` are met. In cases where the loop does not execute, the values of variables remain unchanged, maintaining the state prior to the loop execution.**
