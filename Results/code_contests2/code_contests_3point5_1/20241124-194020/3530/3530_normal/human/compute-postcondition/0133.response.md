According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the conditions related to updating `dp[i][mask]`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `j` needs to be such that it is less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0**
