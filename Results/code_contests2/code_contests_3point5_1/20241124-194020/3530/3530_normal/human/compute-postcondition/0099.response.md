Output State: *`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated based on the conditions within the loop, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `j` is less than `n`.* `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where the bitwise XOR operation is applied to the `mask`.
