Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated, `a` is specified, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. The element at index `i-1` in list `a` is 1 and the `mask` has the `jth` bit set, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. `dp[i][mask]` is then taken modulo `MOD`.**
