Postcondition: ***`j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. This condition covers all possible scenarios and ensures correct handling of edge cases.***
