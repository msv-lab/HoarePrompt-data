According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `mask` ranges from 1 to `1 << n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop updated `dp[i][mask]` based on certain conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]`, `mask`, and `dp[i - 1][mask]`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` ranges from 0 to n-1
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- The conditions for updating `dp[i][mask]` based on `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask` are met
State: **`j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
