Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is 2.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is 2**
