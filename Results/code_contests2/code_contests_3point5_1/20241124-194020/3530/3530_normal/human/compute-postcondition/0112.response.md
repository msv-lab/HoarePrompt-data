Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The variables `a`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is 1**
