According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n) and `j` iterates through the range of (0, n). If the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j` is met, then `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the specified conditions. At the end of the last iteration, the loop did not execute, so no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **No adjustments needed, loop did not execute**
