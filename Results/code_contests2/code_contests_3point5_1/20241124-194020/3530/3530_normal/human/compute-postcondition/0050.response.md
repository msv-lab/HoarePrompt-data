Postcondition: ***After the if block executes, the `dp` matrix is updated based on loop conditions, `mask` is initialized or updated, `a` is initialized or updated, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is less than n+1. If the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` is satisfied, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. All variables maintain their initial conditions, and the loop is executed within the defined boundaries.***
