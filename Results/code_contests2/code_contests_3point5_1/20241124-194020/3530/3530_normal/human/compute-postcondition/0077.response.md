Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated, `a` is specified, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. If the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is 1 and the `jth` bit is set in `mask`, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. All edge cases are handled, ensuring the correct update of `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions specified.***
