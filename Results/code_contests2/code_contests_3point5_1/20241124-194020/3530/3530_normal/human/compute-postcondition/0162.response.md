Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variable `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, so the value of `mask ^ 1 << j` depends on the value of `j`. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
