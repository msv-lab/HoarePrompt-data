Postcondition: ***`j` ranges from 0 to n-1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo MOD. This reflects the recursive nature of updating `dp[i][mask]` based on the previous state `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` when the conditions are met. It covers all cases where `j` is within the specified range and `n` is valid, ensuring the proper calculation and modification of `dp` based on bitwise operations and conditions.***
