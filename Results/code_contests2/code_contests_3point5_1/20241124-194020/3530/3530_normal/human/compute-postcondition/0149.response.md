According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
