According to the code, the loop can execute again if 'j' is less than 'n'. At the end of the last iteration, 'j' is 2 and 'n' is greater than 0. Since 'n' being greater than 0 does not guarantee that the loop will execute again, 'n' needs to be adjusted to 'n' is greater than or equal to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If n is greater than 0, 'j' is 2, 'n' is greater than or equal to 3, and the dp matrix is updated based on the loop conditions with respect to mask, a, and n.**
