According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `j` which should be less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated, `a` is specified, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2**
