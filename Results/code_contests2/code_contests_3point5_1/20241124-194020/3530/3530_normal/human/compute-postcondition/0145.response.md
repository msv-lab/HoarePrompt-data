According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, so `n` being greater than or equal to 1 ensures the loop will execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
