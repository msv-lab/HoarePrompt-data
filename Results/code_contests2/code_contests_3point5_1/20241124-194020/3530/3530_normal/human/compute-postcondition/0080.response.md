Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The variables `i` and `mask` are already specified, `a` is specified, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. The output state remains the same with the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated, `a` is specified, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
