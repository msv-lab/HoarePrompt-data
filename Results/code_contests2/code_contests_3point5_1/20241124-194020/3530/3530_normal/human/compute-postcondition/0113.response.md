Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated. `a` remains fixed. `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n). `n` remains greater than 0. `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` results in a non-zero value, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo MOD. This logic covers all possible scenarios and edge cases regarding the values and relationships between the variables involved in the program fragment.***
