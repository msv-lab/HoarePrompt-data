Postcondition: ***After the if block executes, the `dp` matrix is updated based on loop conditions, `mask` is initialized or updated, `a` is initialized or updated, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is less than n+1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo MOD. This operation covers all possible edge cases and scenarios that may arise during the execution of the if block.***
