According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the dp matrix is updated based on the loop conditions with respect to mask, a, and n does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0.
State: **If n is greater than 0, the dp matrix is updated based on the loop conditions with respect to mask, a, and n, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
