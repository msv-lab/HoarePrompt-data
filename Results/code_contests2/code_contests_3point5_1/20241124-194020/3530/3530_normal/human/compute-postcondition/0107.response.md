Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `n`, and `j` are as described. After executing the code, the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` is calculated based on the XOR operation. 
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is 0**
