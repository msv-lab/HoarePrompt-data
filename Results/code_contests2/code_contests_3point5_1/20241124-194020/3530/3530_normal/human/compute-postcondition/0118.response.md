According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is 3**
