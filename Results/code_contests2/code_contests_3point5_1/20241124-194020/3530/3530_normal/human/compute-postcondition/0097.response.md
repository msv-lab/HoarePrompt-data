Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated based on the conditions within the loop. `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `j` is less than `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the jth bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. The overall state after the execution covers all edge cases, ensuring the proper update of `dp[i][mask]` according to the specified conditions.***
