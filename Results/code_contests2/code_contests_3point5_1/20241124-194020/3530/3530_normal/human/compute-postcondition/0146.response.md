Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided, so the exact calculation cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
