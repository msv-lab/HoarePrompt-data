Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input()` accepts an input. The value of `MOD` is 1000000007, but it is not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the output state is MOD is 1000000007, `n` is an input value.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is an input value**
