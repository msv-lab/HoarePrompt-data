According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` being greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, no adjustment is needed for `n`. The conditions for the loop to execute again are based on `j` and `n`, so the state needs to be adjusted for `j` to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, adjust `j` to the next value based on the loop condition**
