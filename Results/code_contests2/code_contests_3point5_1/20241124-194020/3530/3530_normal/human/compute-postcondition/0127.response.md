Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. The previous values of variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, the value at position `(i-1, j)` in matrix `a` is 1, the bit at position `j` is set in `mask`, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by an unknown value based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, the value at position `(i-1, j)` in matrix `a` is 1, the bit at position `j` is set in `mask`, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by an unknown value based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
