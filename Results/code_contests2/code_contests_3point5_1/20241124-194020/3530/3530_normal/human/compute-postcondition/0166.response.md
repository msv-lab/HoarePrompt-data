Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
