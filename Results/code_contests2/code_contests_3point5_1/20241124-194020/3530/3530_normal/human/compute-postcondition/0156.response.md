According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, which means `j` is already in the range of 0 to n-1. So, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
