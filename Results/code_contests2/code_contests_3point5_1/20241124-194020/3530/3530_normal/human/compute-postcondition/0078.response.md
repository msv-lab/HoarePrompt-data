According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]` is updated, `a` is specified, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to `1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated, `a` is specified, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
