Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the bit at position `j` set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. This update occurs in the context of the dynamic programming array `dp`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases for the given program fragment.***
