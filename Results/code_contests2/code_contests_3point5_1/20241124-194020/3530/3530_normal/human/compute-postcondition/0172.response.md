Output State: 
- After the loop executes:
    - `j` ranges from 0 to n-1.
    - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
    - If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is modulo `MOD`.
- In cases where the loop does not execute:
    - If `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.
    - If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the `j-th` bit of `mask` is not set to 1, the if statement condition will not be met, and the loop will not update `dp[i][mask]`.
- The loop updates `dp[i][mask]` based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]`, `mask`, and `dp[i - 1][mask]`, ensuring proper state transitions and calculations.
