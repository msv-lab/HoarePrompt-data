Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, a new list of integers is appended to `a` after mapping the input values to integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n+1) x (2^n)` where all elements are initialized to 1, `i` is 1, `mask` starts from 1 and `mask` is within the range `(1, 1 << n)`, `j` is 0. The element at index `(i-1, j)` in list `a` is 1 and the `j`-th bit in `mask` is set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
