According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` ranges from 0 to n-1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` ranges from 0 to n-1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `n` is valid, the loop can execute again. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
