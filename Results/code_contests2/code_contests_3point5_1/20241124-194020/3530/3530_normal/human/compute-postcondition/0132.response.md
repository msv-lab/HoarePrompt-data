Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. This update occurs while maintaining the initial conditions.***
