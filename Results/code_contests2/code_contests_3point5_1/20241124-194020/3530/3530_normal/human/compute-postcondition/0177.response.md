Functionality: ** The function reads an input integer n, then processes n lines of input data each containing n integers (0 or 1) separated by spaces. It creates a matrix dp of size (n+1) x (2^n) and updates it based on specific conditions involving the input values. Finally, it prints the value at dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]. The function handles cases where n is 0 or negative, ensuring the loop doesn't execute in those scenarios. **
