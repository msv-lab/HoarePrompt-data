According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, it does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
