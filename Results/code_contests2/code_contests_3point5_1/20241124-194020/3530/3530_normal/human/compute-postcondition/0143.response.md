Example Answer:
The value in the `dp` 2D array at index `[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. The values of `i` and `mask` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the element at index `i-1` of list `a` is 1, and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1.
Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the element at index `i-1` of list `a` is 1, and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1**
