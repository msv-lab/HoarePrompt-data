Output State: **`dp` matrix updated based on loop conditions, `mask` is initialized or updated, `a` is initialized or updated, `n` is greater than 0. The value at index `i-1, j` in `a` is 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and 1 left-shifted by `j` is true. `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
