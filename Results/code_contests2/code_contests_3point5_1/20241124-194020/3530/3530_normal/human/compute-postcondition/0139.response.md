According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will iterate. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. This ensures that the loop will execute again. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **No adjustments needed, all variables remain the same**
