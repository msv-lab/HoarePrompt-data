Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and performing modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, `j`, and `n` are unknown, so the output state is: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo with `MOD`.
Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo with `MOD`**
