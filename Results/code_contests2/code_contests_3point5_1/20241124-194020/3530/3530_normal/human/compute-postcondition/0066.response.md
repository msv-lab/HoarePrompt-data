Postcondition: ***If n is greater than 0, 'j' is 2, 'n' is greater than 0, and the dp matrix is updated based on the loop conditions with respect to mask, a, and n. If the element at position 'i - 1' in the matrix 'a' is 1 and the 'j-th' bit of 'mask' is set to 1, then the element at position 'i' in the dp matrix with 'mask' is incremented by the value at position 'i-1' in the dp matrix with 'mask' xor 1 shifted left by 'j'. The updated value is then taken modulo MOD. This update handles all scenarios, including the case where 'j' needs to be adjusted to 2 for the loop to execute one more time, ensuring the correctness of the dp matrix post-execution of the if statement.***
