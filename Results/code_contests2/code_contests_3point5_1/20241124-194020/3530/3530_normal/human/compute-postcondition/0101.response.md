Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated based on the conditions within the loop, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `j` is less than `n`. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and the `mask` has the jth bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo MOD. This holds true for all valid values of `a`, `mask`, `n`, and `j` within the specified ranges.***
