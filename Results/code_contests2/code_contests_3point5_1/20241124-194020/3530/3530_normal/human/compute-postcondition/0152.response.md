Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask has the j-th bit set, then dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and the result is stored modulo MOD. This operation covers all cases where the conditions are met and ensures the proper updating of dp[i][mask] based on the values of a[i - 1][j], mask, and dp[i - 1][mask].***
