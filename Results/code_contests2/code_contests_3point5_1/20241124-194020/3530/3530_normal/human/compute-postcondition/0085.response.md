Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated with respect to the specified conditions. If `a[i - 1][2]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the 2nd bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << 2]` and computed modulo MOD. The postcondition ensures that `dp[i][mask]` is appropriately modified based on the if condition, considering all specified constraints and edge cases.***
