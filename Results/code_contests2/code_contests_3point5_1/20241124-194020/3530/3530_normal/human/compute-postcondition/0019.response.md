Output State: **If n is greater than 0, then after the loop executes, MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is a list with at least n elements, a new list of integers is appended to a after mapping the input values to integers, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (2^n) where all elements are initialized to 1. If n is 0 or lower, the loop will not execute and dp will remain a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (2^n) initialized with 0**
