Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, `a`, `mask`, `n`, and `j` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `n` remains greater than 0, and `j` is 1.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated, `a` remains fixed, `mask` is within the range of (1, 1 << n), `n` remains greater than 0, `j` is 1**
