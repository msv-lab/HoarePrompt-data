According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop executed successfully up to `i - 1`. To ensure that the loop executes one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

1. `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to represent the next iteration.
2. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, it remains the same.
3. The values of `j` need to be reset to start from 0 for the next iteration.
4. The values of `a[i - 1][j]`, `mask`, and `dp[i - 1][mask]` need to be updated to reflect the next iteration's calculations and state transitions.

State: **Output State: `i` is incremented by 1, `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, values of `a[i - 1][j]`, `mask`, and `dp[i - 1][mask]` are updated accordingly.**
