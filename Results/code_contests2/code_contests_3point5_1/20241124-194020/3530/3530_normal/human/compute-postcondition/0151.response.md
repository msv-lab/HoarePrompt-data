Example Answer:
The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` calculates the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` with the value of `MOD`. As the initial state does not provide the value of `MOD`, we cannot calculate the exact result. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
