According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` ranges from 0 to n-1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the specified range and `n` must still be valid. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` ranges from 0 to n and `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
