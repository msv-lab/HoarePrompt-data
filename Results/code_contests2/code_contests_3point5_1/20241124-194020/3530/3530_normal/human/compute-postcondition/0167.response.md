Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified by taking the modulo of the current value with `MOD`. Since the initial state of `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the output state remains the same with the modification of `dp[i][mask]`.
Output State: **`j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
