According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 101. To execute the loop one more time, N needs to be adjusted to N is greater than the current value of i. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is greater than the current value of i, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', and result is an integer**
