Example Answer:
The value of `result` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, so the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, `S` is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', `result` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, `S` is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', `result` is decreased by 1**
