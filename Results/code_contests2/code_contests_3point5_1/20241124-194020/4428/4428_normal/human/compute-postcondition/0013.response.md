According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, and the loop has already executed for the specified range. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` needs to be adjusted so that the next iteration is possible. 
State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 101, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', and result is an integer**
