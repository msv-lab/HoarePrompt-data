Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'. If S[i] is 'I', result is increased by 1. If S[i] is 'D', result is decreased by 1. The final value of result after the loop execution depends on the occurrences of 'I' and 'D' in the string S, with 'I' increasing the result and 'D' decreasing it. If S is an empty string, the loop will not execute and result will remain 0. After the execution of the if statement, if result is negative, it is set to 0. This accounts for all scenarios including when the result is negative, positive, or zero after the loop execution based on the occurrences of 'I' and 'D' in the string S.***
