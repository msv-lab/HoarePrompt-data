Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, `S` is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'. The value of `result` is determined by the occurrences of 'I' and 'D' in the string `S`, where 'I' increases the result and 'D' decreases it. If `S` is empty, `result` remains 0. After the loop execution, if `result` is negative, it is set to 0. The final value of `result` is printed.**
