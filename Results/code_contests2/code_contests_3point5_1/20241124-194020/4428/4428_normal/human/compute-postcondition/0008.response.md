Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'. If S[i] is 'I', result is increased by 1. If S[i] is 'D', result is decreased by 1. The final value of result after the execution of the if-else block depends on the occurrence of 'I' and 'D' in the string S, with 'I' increasing the result and 'D' decreasing it.***
