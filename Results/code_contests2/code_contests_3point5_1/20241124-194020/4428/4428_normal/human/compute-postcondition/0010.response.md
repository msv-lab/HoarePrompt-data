Example Answer: 
The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, so after execution, `result` will be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'; result is incremented by 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'; result is incremented by 1**
