Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', and result is an integer. If S[i] == 'I', result is incremented by 1. If S[i] == 'D', result is decremented by 1. The program handles all cases where S[i] can be 'I' or 'D' and appropriately adjusts the result value based on the character at index i in string S.***
