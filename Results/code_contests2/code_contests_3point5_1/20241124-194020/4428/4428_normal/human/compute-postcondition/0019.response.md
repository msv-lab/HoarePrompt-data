Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'. If S[i] is 'I', result is increased by 1. If S[i] is 'D', result is decreased by 1. The final value of result after the loop execution depends on the occurrences of 'I' and 'D' in the string S, with 'I' increasing the result and 'D' decreasing it. If S is an empty string, the loop will not execute and result will remain 0. The value of result is negative***
