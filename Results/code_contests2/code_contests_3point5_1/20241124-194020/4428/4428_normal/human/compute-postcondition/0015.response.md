Example Answer:
The value of `result` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 101, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', and result is an integer decremented by 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 101, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', and result is an integer decremented by 1**
