According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `N` needs to be greater than the current value of `i` by at least 1.
State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'.**
