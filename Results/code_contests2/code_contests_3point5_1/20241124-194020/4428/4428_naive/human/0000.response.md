Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by iterating through the string S and incrementing or decrementing the result variable based on the character 'I' or 'D' encountered. It then prints the maximum value taken by x during the operations. The logic of the program is correct and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
