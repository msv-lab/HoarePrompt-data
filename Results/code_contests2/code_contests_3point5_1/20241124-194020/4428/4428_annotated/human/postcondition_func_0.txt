The function `func` reads an integer `N` and a string `S` from user input. It then iterates through the characters of `S`, incrementing the result by 1 for each 'I' and decrementing the result by 1 for each 'D'. If there are characters other than 'I' and 'D' in `S`, the loop does not execute, and the result remains 0. If the final result is negative, it is set to 0. Finally, the function prints the resulting value.
