The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it implicitly accepts the constraints N and S as described.
The function returns a list of integers based on the string S. The list is generated by following the rules:
- If S[i] is 'I', the smallest number not used before is appended to the list.
- If S[i] is 'D', the largest number not used before is appended to the list.
Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to generate a list of integers based on the string S, where 'I' corresponds to appending the smallest unused number and 'D' corresponds to appending the largest unused number.
