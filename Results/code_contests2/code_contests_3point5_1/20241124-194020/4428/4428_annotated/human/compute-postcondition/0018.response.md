Output State: **If the string S contains only 'I' and 'D' characters, the loop will iterate through each character and increment the result by 1 if 'I' is encountered and decrement the result by 1 if 'D' is encountered. The final value of the result will be the difference between the number of 'I's and 'D's in the string. If the string contains any characters other than 'I' and 'D', the loop will not execute and the result will remain 0.**
