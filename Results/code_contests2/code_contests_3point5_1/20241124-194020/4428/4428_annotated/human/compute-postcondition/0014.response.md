Example Answer:
The value of `result` is increased by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, but based on the given information, the result is either increased by 1 if the character at position `i` in string `S` is 'I' or set to N if 'D'. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer + 2, S is a string of length N+1 containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', result is either increased by 1 if S[i] is 'I' or set to N if S[i] is 'D'.
Output State: **N is a positive integer + 2, S is a string of length N+1 containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', result is either increased by 1 if S[i] is 'I' or set to N if S[i] is 'D'**
