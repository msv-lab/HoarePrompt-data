Postcondition: ***S is a string containing only 'I' and 'D' characters. The loop has iterated through each character, incrementing the result by 1 for each 'I' and decrementing by 1 for each 'D'. The final value of the result is less than 0, indicating there are more 'D's than 'I's in the string.***
