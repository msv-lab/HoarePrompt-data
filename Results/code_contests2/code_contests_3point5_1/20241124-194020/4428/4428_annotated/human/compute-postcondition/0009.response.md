According to the code, the loop can execute as long as 'i' is less than 'N'. At the end of the last iteration, 'N' is a positive integer. To execute the loop one more time, 'N' should be adjusted to N+1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is a positive integer + 1, S is a string of length N+1 containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'**
