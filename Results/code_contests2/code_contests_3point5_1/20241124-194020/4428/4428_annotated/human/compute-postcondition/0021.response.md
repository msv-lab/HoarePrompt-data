Postcondition: ***If the string S contains only 'I' and 'D' characters, the loop has iterated through each character, incrementing the result by 1 for each 'I' and decrementing by 1 for each 'D'. The final value of the result will be the difference between the number of 'I's and 'D's in the string. If the string contains any characters other than 'I' and 'D', the loop does not execute and the result remains 0. If after the loop execution the result is less than 0, then the result is set to 0.***
