Example Answer: 
The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, but since it is incremented by 1, the output state is: N is a positive integer + 1, S is a string of length N+1 containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', result is increased by 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer + 1, S is a string of length N+1 containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', result is increased by 1**
