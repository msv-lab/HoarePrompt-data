Example Answer: 
The value of `result` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, but since it was initialized as N+1, the new value is N. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N+1 containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'; result is N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N+1 containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'; result is N**
