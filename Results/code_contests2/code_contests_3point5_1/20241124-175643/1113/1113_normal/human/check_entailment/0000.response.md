Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The code simply replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row of the sudoku puzzle. However, this does not guarantee that the resulting sudoku puzzle will be an anti-sudoku as required by the problem description. The code does not handle the logic of changing at most 9 elements to make it an anti-sudoku. This means that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
