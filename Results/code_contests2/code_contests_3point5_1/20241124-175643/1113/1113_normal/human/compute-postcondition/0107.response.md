Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty. `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row`. The variable `i` is an integer less than 9. If the next character in `row` is '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. If the next character in `row` is not '9', then `nRow` is concatenated with the value of the next character in `row`. After the if else block executes, `res` holds the final modified `nRow` string following the specified conditions and potential edge cases, ensuring the correctness of the replacement and appending operations. In the if part, if `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. In the else part, the value of `i` is concatenated with `nRow`.***
