According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the characters in the `row` string. If there are more characters left in the `row` string, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` string following the specified conditions. `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty. `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row`. The variable `i` is an integer less than 9. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `row` should be checked to determine whether '9' replacement or appending '1' needs to occur. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty. `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row`. The variable `i` is the next character in `row` to be processed.**
