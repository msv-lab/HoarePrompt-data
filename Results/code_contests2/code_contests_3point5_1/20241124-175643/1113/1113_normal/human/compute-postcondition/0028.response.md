According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` string. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than 9. 
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is less than 9**
