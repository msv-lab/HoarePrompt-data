Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. If `row` is empty, `res` remains the same. If `row` only contains '1's or characters other than '9', `res` will be the same as the initial state. If `row` ends with '9', '1' is appended to `res` after replacing '9' with '1'.**
