Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` is not empty. If the first character in `row` is '9', then `nRow` has '1' appended at the end. If the first character in `row` is not '9', then `nRow` remains unchanged.***
