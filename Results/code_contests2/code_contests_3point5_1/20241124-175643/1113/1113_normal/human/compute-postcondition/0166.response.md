Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `res` contains modified `nRow` strings based on conditions. `T` covers the range 0 to 9. `row` contains the stripped input string allowing modification of `nRow`. For the if part, if `i` equals '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. For the else part, if `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. In all cases, `nRow` either contains '1' if `i` equals '9' or the value of `i` itself if `i` is not equal to '9'. The precondition states that `res` contains modified `nRow` strings based on conditions, `T` covers the range 0 to 9, `row` contains the stripped input string allowing modification of `nRow`, `nRow` either contains '1' if `i` equals '9' or the value of `i` itself if `i` is not equal to '9', and `row` is not empty.***
