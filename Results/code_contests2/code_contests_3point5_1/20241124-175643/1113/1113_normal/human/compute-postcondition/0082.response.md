Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the `nRow` string in each iteration. Since `nRow` contains the modified strings after replacements, and `i` is the next character in `row`, the `nRow` string will keep growing as each character in `row` is added to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated in each iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated in each iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`**
