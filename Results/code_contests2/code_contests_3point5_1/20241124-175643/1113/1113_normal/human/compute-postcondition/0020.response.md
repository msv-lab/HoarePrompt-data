Postcondition: ***`sys.stdout` is set to `io.BytesIO()`, the lambda function `write` is registered to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output on program exit, `maxint` is set to positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is in the range from 0 to 8 (adjusted to the next value), `row` is not empty. If `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, `i` is added to `nRow`. This ensures that `nRow` is correctly modified based on the value of `i`, maintaining the initial conditions and constraints of the program.***
