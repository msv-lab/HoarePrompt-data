According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times because it iterates from 0 to 8. Before the loop starts, the key conditions are that `row` contains at least 1 character and it must have '9' present for any replacements to occur in `nRow`. Since `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, it implies that `nRow` will be updated during each iteration of the loop. Additionally, `i` is the next character in `row`, so it indicates the progression of iteration within the loop.

State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains at least 1 character with '9' present, `nRow` is being updated in each iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`**.
