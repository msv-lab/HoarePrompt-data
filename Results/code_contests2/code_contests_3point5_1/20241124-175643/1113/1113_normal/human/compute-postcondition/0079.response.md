Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated in each iteration, `i` is the first character in `row`. If the first character `i` in `row` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the first character from `row` is appended to `nRow`. The overall state of the program ensures proper handling of the edge cases where the first character in `row` is '9' or not, ensuring the integrity of `res`, `nRow`, `row`, and `i` after the execution of the if-else block.***
