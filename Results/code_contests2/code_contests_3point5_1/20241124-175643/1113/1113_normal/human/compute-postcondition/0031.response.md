According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `res` contains the modified `nRow` string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty and `i` is less than the length of `row`. 
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is less than 9, `row` contains the stripped input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is not empty**
