Example Answer:
The list `res` has modified `nRow` strings based on conditions. The range of `T` is 0 to 8. The input string `row` is stripped of whitespaces. The list `nRow` contains one more element than before with each element being the result of the condition check. If the element in `row` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the element of `row` is appended as is to `nRow`. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `nRow` remains empty. After the execution of the code snippet, `nRow` is appended to the list `res`.
Output State: **`res` contains modified `nRow` strings based on conditions, `T` covers the range 0 to 8, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespaces, `nRow` contains one more element than before with each element being the result of the condition check, if the element in `row` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`, otherwise, the element of `row` is appended as is to `nRow`. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `nRow` remains empty**
