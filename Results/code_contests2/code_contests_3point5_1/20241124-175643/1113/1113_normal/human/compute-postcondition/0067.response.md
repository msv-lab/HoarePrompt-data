Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` string after replacing '9' with '1' where applicable, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains the stripped input string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is the result of the replacements and additions based on the conditions specified in the program fragment. If '9' is not present in `row`, `nRow` remains identical to `row`. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `res` remains unchanged. `res` appends `nRow`.**
