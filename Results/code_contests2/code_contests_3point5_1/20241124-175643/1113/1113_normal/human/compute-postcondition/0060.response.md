Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains the stripped input string with at least 1 character. If the value of `i` is '9', then '9' is replaced with '1' in `nRow` and `nRow` is appended with '1'. If '9' is not the first character in `row`, then `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`. In all cases, the final state of `nRow` reflects the appropriate replacements and additions based on the conditions specified in the program fragment.***
