According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `row` string. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated in each iteration, `i` is the first character in `row`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the first character `i` in `row` is equal to '9', then '1' should be appended to `nRow`.
- If the first character `i` in `row` is not equal to '9', then the first character from `row` should be appended to `nRow`.

State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated in each iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`.**
