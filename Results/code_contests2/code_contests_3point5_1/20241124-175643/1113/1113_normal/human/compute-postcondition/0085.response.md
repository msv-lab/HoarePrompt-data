Example Answer: 
`nRow` is appended with the string '1', so the value of `nRow` is updated to include '1'. As `nRow` contains the modified strings after replacements, the output state is `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated in each iteration with '1', `i` is the next character in `row`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated in each iteration with '1', `i` is the next character in `row`**
