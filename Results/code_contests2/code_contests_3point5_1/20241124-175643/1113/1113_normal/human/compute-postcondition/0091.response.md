According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9', `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row`, and `i` is the last character in `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to be less than 9.
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'; `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty; `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row`; `i` is less than 9**
