Output State: 
- `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'.
- If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains the same as the initial state.
- If `row` only contains '1's or characters other than '9', the loop will iterate through each character in `row` and append them to `nRow` without any modifications. 
- If `row` ends with '9', '1' will be appended to `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1'.
- After the loop executes, `res` will contain the final modified `nRow` strings with the specified replacements and appends.
