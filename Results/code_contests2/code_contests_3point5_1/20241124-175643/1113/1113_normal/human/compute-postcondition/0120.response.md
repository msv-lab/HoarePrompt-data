According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If there are more characters in `row`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings, `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` is not empty. If the first character in `row` is '9', then `nRow` has '1' appended at the end. If the first character in `row` is not '9', then `nRow` remains unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain more characters to iterate over.
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9', `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` contains more characters**
