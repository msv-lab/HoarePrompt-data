According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the `row` string. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains the stripped input string with at least 1 character. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the next character `i` is appended to `nRow`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `row` string must still have characters left, so `i` should not be the last character in `row`. If `i` is not equal to '9', then the next character should be appended to `nRow`. If `i` is '9', then '1' should be appended to `nRow`.

State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains the stripped input string with at least 2 characters left to process.**
