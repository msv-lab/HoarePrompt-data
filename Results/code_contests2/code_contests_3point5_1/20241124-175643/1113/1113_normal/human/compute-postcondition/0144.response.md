Example Answer:
The value '1' is appended to the `nRow` string. The length of `nRow` increases by 1 due to the append operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains modified `nRow` strings based on conditions, `T` covers the range 0 to 8, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespaces, and `nRow` contains one more element than before with the first element being appended as per the condition mentioned above.
