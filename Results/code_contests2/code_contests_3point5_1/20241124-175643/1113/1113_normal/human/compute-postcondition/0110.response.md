Example Answer: 
The loop iterates over each character in `row` and modifies `nRow` accordingly by replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. After the loop completes, the modified `nRow` is appended to `res`. Since the loop will not execute if `row` is empty, `res` remains unchanged in this scenario. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'**
