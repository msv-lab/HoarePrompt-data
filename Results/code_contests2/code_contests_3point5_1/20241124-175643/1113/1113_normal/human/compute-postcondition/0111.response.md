According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9', `i` is 9**
