Example Answer:
The string `nRow` is appended with the character '1', so after execution, `nRow` will have one extra character '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated in each iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated in each iteration, `i` is the next character in `row'**
