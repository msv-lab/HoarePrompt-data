Output State: After the loop executes, `res` will contain modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. The loop will execute `T` times, with `T` ranging from 0 to 8. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains unchanged. If `row` only contains '1's or characters other than '9', `res` will be the same as the initial state. `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains the stripped input string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is the result of the replacements and additions based on the conditions specified in the program fragment. If '9' is not present in `row`, `nRow` remains identical to `row`. The program then writes the elements of `res` separated by a new line.
