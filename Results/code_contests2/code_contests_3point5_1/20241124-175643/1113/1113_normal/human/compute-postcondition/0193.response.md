Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The loop will execute at least once if `row` is not empty. If `row` is empty, the loop won't execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string. `res` is appended with the updated value of `nRow`.**
