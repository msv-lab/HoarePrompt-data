According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `row`. Since `row` contains the stripped input string, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in `row`. `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row` if '9' is present, otherwise `nRow` is identical to `row`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `row` must have at least 1 character, and `i` needs to be the first character in `row`.

State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` contains the stripped input string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row` if '9' is present, otherwise `nRow` is identical to `row`, `nRow` is an empty string**
