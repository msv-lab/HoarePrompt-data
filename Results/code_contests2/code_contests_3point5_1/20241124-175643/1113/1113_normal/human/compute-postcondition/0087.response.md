Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the character `i` is appended to `nRow`. In all cases, `nRow` is being continuously updated in each iteration.***
