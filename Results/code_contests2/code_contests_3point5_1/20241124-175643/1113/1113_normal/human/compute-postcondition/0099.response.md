Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty. `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row`. `i` is less than 9. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios including the case when `i` is equal to '9' and when it is not, ensuring the proper string manipulation and appending logic.***
