Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, and the value of `i` is not equal to '9'. The previous value of `nRow` and `i` is unknown, so the output state is: `row` is not empty, and the value of `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.
Output State: **`row` is not empty, and the value of `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`**
