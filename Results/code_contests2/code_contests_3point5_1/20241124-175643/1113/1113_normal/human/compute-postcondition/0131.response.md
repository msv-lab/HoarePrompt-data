According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows: `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings as described, and the loop has executed for the last time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`. It needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9', `i` is 9**
