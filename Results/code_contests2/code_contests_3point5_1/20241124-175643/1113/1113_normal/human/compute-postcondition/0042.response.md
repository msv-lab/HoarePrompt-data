Example Answer: 
The value '1' is appended to the nRow string. The variables res, i, and row remain unchanged. The condition that i is not equal to '9' still holds true. Therefore, the Output State is: res contains the modified nRow string, i is updated to the next character in row, row still contains remaining characters, nRow has been appropriately modified based on the value of i, row is not empty, i is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **res contains the modified nRow string, i is updated to the next character in row, row still contains remaining characters, nRow has been appropriately modified based on the value of i, row is not empty, i is not equal to '9'**
