Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is less than 9, `row` contains the stripped input string, `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row` if '9' is present, otherwise `nRow` is identical to `row`. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute and `res` remains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is less than 9, `row` is empty, and `nRow` is an empty string.**
