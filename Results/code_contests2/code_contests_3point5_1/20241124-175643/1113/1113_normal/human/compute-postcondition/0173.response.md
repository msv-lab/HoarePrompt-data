Output State: **After the loop executes, `res` will contain modified `nRow` strings based on conditions. The range of `T` will be 0 to 9. `row` will still contain the stripped input string allowing modification of `nRow`. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` will have '1' appended to it. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` will be appended with the value of `i`. All variables except `nRow` will remain unchanged. If `row` is empty, the loop will not execute and `nRow` will remain an empty string.**
