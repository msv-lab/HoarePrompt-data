According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the character `i` is appended to `nRow`. In all cases, `nRow` is being continuously updated in each iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the `row` needs to be processed. Since the loop works on each character in `row`, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- The next character in `row` needs to be set as the current character `i`.
- The `nRow` needs to be updated based on the rules mentioned in the loop body.

State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty. If the next character in `row` is equal to '9', then '1' will be appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the next character will be appended to `nRow`.**
