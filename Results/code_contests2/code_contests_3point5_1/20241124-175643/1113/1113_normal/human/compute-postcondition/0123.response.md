Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, `i` is appended to `nRow`. In all cases, `res` will contain the final modified `nRow` strings with the specified replacements and appends.***
