Example Answer: 
`nRow` is updated by concatenating the value of `i`, which is the first character in `row`. As `i` is the first character and it's not equal to '9', the value of `nRow` will have the same value as `row` with the first character added at the end. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated with the first character from `row`, `i` is the first character in `row`, and the first character `i` is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated with the first character from `row`, `i` is the first character in `row`, and the first character `i` is not equal to '9'**
