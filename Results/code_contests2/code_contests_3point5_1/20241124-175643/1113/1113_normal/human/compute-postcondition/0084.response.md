According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more characters left in the `row` string. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated in each iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the character `i` is appended to `nRow.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `i` in `row` needs to be considered. If there are more characters left in `row`, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is the position of `i` in `row` and updating `nRow` accordingly.

State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated in each iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`**.
