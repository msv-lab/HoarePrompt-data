Postcondition: ***`res` contains modified `nRow` strings based on conditions. `T` covers the range 0 to 8. `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespaces. `nRow` contains one more element than before. If the first element in `row` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the first element of `row` is appended as is to `nRow`.***
