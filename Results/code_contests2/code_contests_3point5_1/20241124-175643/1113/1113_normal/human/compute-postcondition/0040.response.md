Postcondition: ***res contains the modified nRow string, i is less than 9, row contains the stripped input string, nRow is either '1' if i is '9' or it contains the concatenated values of i, row is not empty, i is not equal to '9'. After the execution of the if-else block, nRow contains the modified string where if i is '9', '1' is appended to nRow, otherwise, the value of i is concatenated to nRow. All edge cases including i being '9', i being less than 9, and row not being empty are handled appropriately in the postcondition.***
