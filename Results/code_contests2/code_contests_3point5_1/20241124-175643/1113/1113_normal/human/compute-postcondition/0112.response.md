Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the input string after removing any leading or trailing white spaces. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9', `i` is 9, `row` is the input string without leading or trailing white spaces.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9', `i` is 9, `row` is the input string without leading or trailing white spaces**
