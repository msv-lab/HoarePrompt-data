Output State: **After the loop executes, `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. If `row` is empty, `res` remains unchanged. If `row` only contains '1's or characters other than '9', `res` will be the same as the initial state.**
