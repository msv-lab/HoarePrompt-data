Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty. `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row` and concatenated with '1'. `i` is less than 9. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. The loop can execute again.**
