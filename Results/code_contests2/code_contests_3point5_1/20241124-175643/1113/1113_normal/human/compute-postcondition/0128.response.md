According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the next character in `row`. If the next character is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the next character is appended to `nRow`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after the specified replacements and appends. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `row` must be considered. If the next character is '9', '1' will be appended to `nRow`. If the next character is not '9', the next character will be appended to `nRow`.

State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. If the next character in `row` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the next character is appended to `nRow`.**
