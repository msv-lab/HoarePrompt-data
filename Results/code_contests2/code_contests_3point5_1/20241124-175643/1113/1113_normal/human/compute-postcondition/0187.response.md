According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is known that `row` is not empty. Also, if `i` equals '9', then `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by `i`. Both branches ensure that `nRow` is modified based on the condition, preserving the non-empty state of `row`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `row` must remain non-empty and the modification based on the condition should be considered. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **row is not empty**
