Example Answer: 
The variable `input` is reassigned to a lambda function that reads input from `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`. The standard output `sys.stdout` is set to `io.BytesIO()`, which is a buffer for writing output. The lambda function is registered to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output on program exit. Therefore, the Output State is: `sys.stdout` is set to `io.BytesIO()` and the lambda function is registered to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output on program exit.
Output State: **`sys.stdout` is set to `io.BytesIO()` and the lambda function is registered to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output on program exit**
