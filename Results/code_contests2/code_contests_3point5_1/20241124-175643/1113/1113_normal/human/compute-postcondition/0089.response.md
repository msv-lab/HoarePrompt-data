Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1', `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty. `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row`. `i` is the last character in `row`. If the last character `i` in `row` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the last character from `row` is appended to `nRow`. The loop will always execute at least once if `row` is not empty.**
