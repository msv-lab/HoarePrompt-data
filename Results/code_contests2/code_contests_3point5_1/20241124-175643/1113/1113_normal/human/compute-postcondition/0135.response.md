Example Answer:
The value of `row` is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains modified `nRow` strings based on conditions, `T` covers the range 0 to 8, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespaces.
Output State: **`res` contains modified `nRow` strings based on conditions, `T` covers the range 0 to 8, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespaces**
