Example Answer: 
The code appends '1' to the end of `nRow`. If the last character in `row` was '9', it would have been replaced with '1' before this operation. So, after running the code, the output state is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9', `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` contains more characters.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9', `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` contains more characters**
