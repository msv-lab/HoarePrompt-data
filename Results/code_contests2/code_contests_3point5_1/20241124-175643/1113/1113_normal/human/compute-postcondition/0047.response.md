Example Answer:
The `nRow` string is appended to the list `res`. The previous state of `res` contains the modified `nRow` string, and the loop executes as long as `i` is less than 9. The states of `i`, `row`, and `nRow` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is less than 9, `row` contains the stripped input string, `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row` if '9' is present, otherwise `nRow` is identical to `row`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is less than 9, `row` contains the stripped input string, `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row` if '9' is present, otherwise `nRow` is identical to `row`**
