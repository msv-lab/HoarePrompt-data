According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `row` string is not empty. Since `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacement and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `res` should contain the modified `nRow` strings after the replacement and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9', `row` should still contain the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` should be the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row`, and `i` should be less than 9.
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9', `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is less than 9**
