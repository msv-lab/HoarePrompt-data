Output State: **`res` contains modified `nRow` strings based on conditions. `T` covers the range 0 to 8. `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespaces. `nRow` contains one more element than before with each element being the result of the condition check. If the element in `row` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the element of `row` is appended as is to `nRow`. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `nRow` remains empty.**
