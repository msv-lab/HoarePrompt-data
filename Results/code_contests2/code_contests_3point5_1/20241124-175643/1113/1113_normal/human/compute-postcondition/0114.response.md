According to the code, the loop can execute based on the input string `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that the loop can execute. Therefore, the adjusted states should be: `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9', `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` is not empty.
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9', `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` is not empty**
