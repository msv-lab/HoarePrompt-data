Output State: `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty. `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row`. The variable `i` is an integer less than 9. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. The loop will execute for each character in `row` and perform the respective replacement or appending based on the character being '9' or not. If `row` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, leaving `res` unchanged.
