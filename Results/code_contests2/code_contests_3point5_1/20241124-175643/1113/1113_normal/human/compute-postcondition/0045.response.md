According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `row` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is updated to the next character in `row`, `row` still contains remaining characters, `nRow` has been appropriately modified based on the value of `i`, `row` is not empty, and `i` is not equal to '9'. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the character `i` is appended to `nRow. 

To execute the loop one more time, the adjustment needed is to move to the next character in `row` for `i` and update `nRow` accordingly based on the new value of `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is updated to the next character in `row`, `row` still contains remaining characters, `nRow` has been appropriately modified based on the new value of `i`, `row` is not empty, `i` is not equal to '9'**
