According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nRow` is an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty. 
State: **`res` contains modified `nRow` strings based on conditions, `T` covers the range 0 to 9, `row` contains the stripped input string allowing modification of `nRow`, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is not empty**
