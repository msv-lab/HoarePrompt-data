Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the variable `res` will contain modified `nRow` strings based on conditions. The value of `T` will cover the range 0 to 9. The variable `row` will still contain the stripped input string allowing modification of `nRow`. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` will have '1' appended to it. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` will be appended with the value of `i`. The variable `row` is not empty and still contains unprocessed characters. All variables except `nRow` remain unchanged.***
