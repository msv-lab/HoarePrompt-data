Functionality: **The function `func` sets up the standard input and output to read and write bytes. It then reads an integer `T` from the standard input and loops `T` times. Within each iteration, it reads a string `row`, replaces any '9' with '1', and appends '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. These modified strings are stored in a list `res`. Finally, the function writes the modified strings in `res` separated by newlines to the standard output. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
