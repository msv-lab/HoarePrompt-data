Output State: **If `row` is not empty, the loop will iterate over each character in `row`. If the character `i` is '9', then '1' will be appended to `nRow`, otherwise the value of `i` will be appended to `nRow`. This ensures that `nRow` is correctly modified based on the value of `i`. The loop will execute as long as there are characters in `row` to iterate over. If `row` is empty, the loop will not execute and `nRow` will remain an empty string.**
