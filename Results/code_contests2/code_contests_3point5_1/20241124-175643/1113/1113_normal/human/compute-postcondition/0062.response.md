Example Answer:
The code snippet appends the character '1' to the string stored in `nRow`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains the stripped input string with at least 1 character, the appropriate replacements and additions have been made in `nRow` based on the conditions specified in the program fragment.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains the stripped input string with at least 1 character, the appropriate replacements and additions have been made in `nRow` based on the conditions specified in the program fragment, '1' is appended to `nRow`**
