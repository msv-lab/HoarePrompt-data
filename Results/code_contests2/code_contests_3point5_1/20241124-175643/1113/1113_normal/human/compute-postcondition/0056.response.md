Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` contains the stripped input string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row` if '9' is present, otherwise `nRow` is identical to `row`, `nRow` is an empty string. If the value of `i` is '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, if '9' is not the first character in `row`, `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`.***
