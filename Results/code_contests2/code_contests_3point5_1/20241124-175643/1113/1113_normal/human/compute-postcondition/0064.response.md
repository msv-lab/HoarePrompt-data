Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains the stripped input string with at least 1 character. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the next character `i` is appended to `nRow`. This covers all cases where the appropriate replacements and additions have been made in `nRow` based on the conditions specified in the program fragment.***
