Example Answer:
The code snippet appends '1' to the existing `nRow` string. The modification made after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9' is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. If the next character in `row` is '9', '1' should be appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the next character should be appended to `nRow`.**
