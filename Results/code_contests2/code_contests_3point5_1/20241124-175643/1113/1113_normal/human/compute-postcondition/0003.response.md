Example Answer:
The lambda function `write` is assigned the value `sys.stdout.write`. This means that the `write` function now points to the `write` function of `sys.stdout`. The state of `sys.stdout` is `io.BytesIO()`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sys.stdout` is set to `io.BytesIO()` and the lambda function `write` is registered to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output on program exit.
Output State: **`sys.stdout` is set to `io.BytesIO()` and the lambda function `write` is registered to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output on program exit**
