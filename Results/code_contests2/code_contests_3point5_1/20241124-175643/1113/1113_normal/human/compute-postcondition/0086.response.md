Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the end of the string `nRow` in each iteration. The previous values of `nRow` and `i` are not provided, so the output state is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated in each iteration.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacements, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` is being updated in each iteration**
