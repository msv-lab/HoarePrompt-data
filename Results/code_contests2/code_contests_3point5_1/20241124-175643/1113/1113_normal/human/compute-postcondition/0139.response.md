Example Answer:
After executing the code, '1' is added to the end of the string `nRow`. The initial state indicates that `nRow` contains modified strings based on conditions, and after adding '1', it now contains one additional element. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains modified `nRow` strings based on conditions, `T` covers the range 0 to 8, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespaces, `nRow` contains one more element than before, `i` represents the first element in `row`, and the first element in `row` is equal to '9'.
Output State: **`res` contains modified `nRow` strings based on conditions, `T` covers the range 0 to 8, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespaces, `nRow` contains one more element than before, `i` represents the first element in `row`, and the first element in `row` is equal to '9'**
