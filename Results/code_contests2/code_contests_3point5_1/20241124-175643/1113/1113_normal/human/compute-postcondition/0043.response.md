Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the value of `i`, and `i` is updated to the next character in `row`. Since `row` still contains remaining characters, `nRow` has been appropriately modified based on the value of `i`. The conditions state that `row` is not empty and `i` is not equal to '9'. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is updated to the next character in `row`, `row` still contains remaining characters, `nRow` has been appropriately modified based on the value of `i`, `row` is not empty, `i` is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is updated to the next character in `row`, `row` still contains remaining characters, `nRow` has been appropriately modified based on the value of `i`, `row` is not empty, `i` is not equal to '9'**
