According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters in the `row` string. Therefore, the loop will execute if the `row` string is not empty. Before the loop starts, `T` is 0 to 9, `res` will contain modified `nRow` strings based on conditions, `i` is 1, and `nRow` is an empty string do not ensure that the loop will execute. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`row` is not empty**
