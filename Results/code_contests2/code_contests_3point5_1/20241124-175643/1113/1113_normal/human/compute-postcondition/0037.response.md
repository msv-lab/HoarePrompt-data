According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is less than 9, `row` contains the stripped input string, `nRow` is either '1' if `i` is '9' or it contains the concatenated values of `i`, `row` is not empty, and `i` is not equal to '9'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `row` must still not be empty.
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is less than 9, `row` contains the stripped input string, `nRow` is either '1' if `i` is '9' or it contains the concatenated values of `i`, `row` is not empty, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
