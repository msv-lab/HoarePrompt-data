According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the `row` string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is less than 9, `row` contains the stripped input string, `nRow` is either '1' if `i` is '9' or it contains the concatenated values of `i`, `row` is not empty, `i` is not equal to '9'. After the execution of the if-else block, `nRow` contains the modified string where if `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`, otherwise, the value of `i` is concatenated to `nRow. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- Since `i` is iterating over `row`, `i` needs to be updated to the next character in `row`.
- If the current character `i` in `row` is the last character, then the loop should not execute again.

State: **res contains the modified nRow string, i is updated to the next character in row, row still contains remaining characters, nRow has been appropriately modified based on the value of i, row is not empty, i is not equal to '9'.**
