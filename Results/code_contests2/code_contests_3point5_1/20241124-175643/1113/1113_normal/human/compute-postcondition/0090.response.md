Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to `res`. The value of `nRow` is obtained by replacing '9' with '1' in `row` and adding '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. The loop always executes at least once. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'; `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty; `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row`; `i` is the last character in `row`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'; `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty; `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row`; `i` is the last character in `row`**
