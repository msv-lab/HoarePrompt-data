Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended to `res`, which is a list. The loop iterates over each character in `row` and modifies `nRow` accordingly. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string. The output state after executing the code is: `res` contains the modified `nRow` string.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` string**
