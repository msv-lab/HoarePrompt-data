According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `row` variable. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is not empty. If the value of `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it. If the value of `i` is not '9', `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`row` is not empty**
