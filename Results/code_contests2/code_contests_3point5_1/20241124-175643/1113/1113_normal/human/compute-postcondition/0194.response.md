According to the code, the loop will execute at least once as long as `row` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` should be adjusted to 9. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is 9, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions described above**
