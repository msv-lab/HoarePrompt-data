Example Answer:
The `atexit.register` function registers a lambda function that writes the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output. The initial state has `sys.stdout` set to `io.BytesIO()`, which is an in-memory stream. After executing the code snippet, the lambda function is registered to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output when the program exits. Therefore, the Output State is: `sys.stdout` is set to `io.BytesIO()` and the lambda function is registered to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output on program exit.
Output State: **`sys.stdout` is set to `io.BytesIO()` and the lambda function is registered to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output on program exit**
