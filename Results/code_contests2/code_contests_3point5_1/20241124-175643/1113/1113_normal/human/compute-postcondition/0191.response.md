According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.
To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. If the last character in `row` is not '9', `nRow` should be incremented by the value of the last character in `row`.
2. If the last character in `row` is '9', then '1' should be appended to `nRow`.
State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is modified based on the last character in `row` as described above.**
