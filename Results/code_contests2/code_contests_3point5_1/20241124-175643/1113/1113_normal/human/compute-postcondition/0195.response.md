Output State: **After the loop executes, `res` will contain modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. The range of `T` will be 0 to 8. `row` will contain the stripped input string after removing whitespaces. If `row` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `nRow` will remain empty. If `row` only consists of '1's or characters other than '9', `res` will be the same as the initial state.**
