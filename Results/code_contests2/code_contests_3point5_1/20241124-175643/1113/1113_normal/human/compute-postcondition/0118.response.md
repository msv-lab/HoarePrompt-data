Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the end of `nRow`, so `nRow` now contains the modified strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` was '9', and the new string now includes the character `i`. Since `i` is not '9', it will be directly added to `nRow`.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9', `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` is not empty, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
