According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains the stripped input string with at least 1 character, and `nRow` is the result of the replacements and additions based on the conditions specified. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next character in `row`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` after replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains the stripped input string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is the result of the replacements and additions, append `nRow` to `res`**
