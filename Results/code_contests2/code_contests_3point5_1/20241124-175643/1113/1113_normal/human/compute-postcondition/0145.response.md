Example Answer: 
`nRow` is appended with the value of `i`, expanding the size of `nRow` by one element. The previous state of `nRow` is modified by adding `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains modified `nRow` strings based on conditions, `T` covers the range 0 to 8, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespaces, and `nRow` contains one more element than before with the first element being appended as per the condition mentioned above.
Output State: **`res` contains modified `nRow` strings based on conditions, `T` covers the range 0 to 8, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespaces, and `nRow` contains one more element than before with the first element being appended as per the condition mentioned above**
