Based on the given information, at the end of the previous iteration, `res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is less than 9, `row` contains the stripped input string, `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row` if '9' is present, otherwise `nRow` is identical to `row`.

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 because `i` is less than 9 at the end of the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains the modified `nRow` string, `i` is less than 9 and incremented by 1, `row` contains the stripped input string, `nRow` is the result of replacing '9' with '1' in `row` if '9' is present, otherwise `nRow` is identical to `row`**
