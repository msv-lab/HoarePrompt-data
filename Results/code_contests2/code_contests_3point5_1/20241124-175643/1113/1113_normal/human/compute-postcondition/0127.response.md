Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified `nRow` strings after replacing '9' with '1' and appending '1' if the last character in `row` is '9'. If the next character in `row` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the next character is appended to `nRow`. In all cases, `res` contains the final modified `nRow` strings with the specified replacements and appends.***
