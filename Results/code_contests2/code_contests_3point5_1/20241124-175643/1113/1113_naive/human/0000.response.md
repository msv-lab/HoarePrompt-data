Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. It simply replaces all occurrences of '9' in each row with '1', which does not guarantee that the resulting sudoku puzzle will be an anti-sudoku. The program does not consider the constraints required for an anti-sudoku puzzle, such as ensuring each row, column, and 3x3 block contains at least two equal elements.

Therefore, the program needs to be modified to actually generate an anti-sudoku puzzle by strategically changing at most 9 elements while satisfying all the conditions mentioned in the problem description.
