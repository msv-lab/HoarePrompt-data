Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly change at most 9 elements of the given sudoku solution to make it an anti-sudoku. The program simply replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row, which does not guarantee that each row, column, and block will have at least two equal elements. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
154873296
386592714
729641835
863725149
975314628
412968357
631457982
598236471
247189563
```

The output of the program will be:
```
154873296
386592714
729641835
863725149
975314628
412968357
631457982
598236471
247189563
```

In this case, the output remains the same as the input, which does not satisfy the conditions of an anti-sudoku. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not produce the required output for the given problem description.
