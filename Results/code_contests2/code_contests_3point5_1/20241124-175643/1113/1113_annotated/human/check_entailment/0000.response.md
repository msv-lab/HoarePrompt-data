Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program reads the input correctly, modifies the input rows by replacing '9' with '1' to create an anti-sudoku solution, and then prints the modified rows as output. The logic is simple and straightforward, and it follows the problem description accurately. Since the code handles all test cases as described in the problem statement, we can conclude that the program is correct.
