Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is the second element in `row`. The initial state guarantees that `row` has at least 1 element and `nRow` signifies that at least 2 elements have been processed from `row`. After execution, `nRow` will have processed at least 3 elements from `row`. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` has at least 1 element, `nRow` signifies that at least 3 elements have been processed from `row`, `i` is the second element in `row`.
Output State: **`row` has at least 1 element, `nRow` signifies that at least 3 elements have been processed from `row`, `i` is the second element in `row`**
