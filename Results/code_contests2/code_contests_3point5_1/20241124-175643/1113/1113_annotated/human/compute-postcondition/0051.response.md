According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is any iterable object, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nRow` being an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is an iterable object, `i` is updated according to the first element in `row`, and `res` is dependent on the input.
State: **`i` is updated based on the first element in `row`, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` is dependent on the input, `row` is an iterable object**
