Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous values of `nRow`, `i`, and other variables are unknown, so the output state is: `res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is less than `T`, `row` contains the stripped input value with at least one element, and `nRow` is adjusted based on the value of `i`.
Output State: **`res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is less than `T`, `row` contains the stripped input value with at least one element, and `nRow` is adjusted based on the value of `i`**
