Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is incremented by 1 and must be less than 9. The value of `nRow` is adjusted based on these conditions. The value of `row` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the appended value of updated `nRow`, `i` is incremented by 1 and less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is adjusted based on the above conditions, `row` is not empty.
Output State: **`res` contains the appended value of updated `nRow`, `i` is incremented by 1 and less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is adjusted based on the above conditions, `row` is not empty**
