Example Answer:
The input is stripped and assigned to `row`. If `row` is not empty, `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1'. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string and is appended to `res`. `i` is assigned the value 9. The state of `nRow` and `res` is dependent on the input. 
Output State: **`i` is 9, the state of `nRow` and `res` is dependent on the input**
