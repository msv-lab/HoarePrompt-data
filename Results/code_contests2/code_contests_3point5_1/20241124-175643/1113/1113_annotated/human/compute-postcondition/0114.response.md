According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nRow` is an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `nRow` is now the value of `row`, and `i` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `i` being less than 9 and `t` being less than `T` need to be maintained.
State: **`res` contains the appended value of `nRow`, `i` is incremented by 1 and less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is the value of `row`, `row` is not empty**
