According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1' implies that `row` has at least one '9' to be replaced. So, for the loop to execute, `row` needs to have at least one '9' to replace, `i` is the next value, `t` has been incremented to the next value, `nRow` is an empty string, and `nRow` is not an empty string.
State: **`res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1', `i` is the next value, `t` has been incremented to the next value, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is not an empty string, `row` has at least one '9' to be replaced**
