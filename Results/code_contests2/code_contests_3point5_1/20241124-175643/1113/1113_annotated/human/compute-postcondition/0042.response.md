Example Answer: 
`nRow` is concatenated with '1', signifying that at least 4 elements have been processed from `row`. The value of `i` is the third element in `row`, so it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` has at least 1 element, `nRow` signifies that at least 4 elements have been processed from `row`, `i` is the third element in `row`.
Output State: **`row` has at least 1 element, `nRow` signifies that at least 4 elements have been processed from `row`, `i` is the third element in `row`**
