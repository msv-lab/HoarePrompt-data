According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` contains either '1' or the value of `i`, `row` is not empty. If the value of `i` is '9', then `nRow` contains '1'. If the value of `i` is not '9', then `nRow` contains the concatenated value of `i`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` contains either '1' or the value of `i`, `row` has more elements. If the value of `i` is '9', then `nRow` contains '1'. If the value of `i` is not '9', then `nRow` contains the concatenated value of `i`.**
