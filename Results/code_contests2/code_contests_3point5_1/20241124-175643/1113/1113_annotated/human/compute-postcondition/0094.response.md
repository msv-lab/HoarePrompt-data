According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is not empty**
