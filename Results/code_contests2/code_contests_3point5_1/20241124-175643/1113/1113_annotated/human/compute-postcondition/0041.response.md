According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `row` to process. At the end of the last iteration, `row` has at least 1 element, `nRow` signifies that at least 2 elements have been processed from `row`, `i` is the second element in `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, `i` is appended to `nRow`. In both cases, the state of `nRow` reflects the processing of elements from `row. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state of `nRow` should reflect the processing of at least 3 elements from `row`, and the next element in `row` should be assigned to `i`. If the next element is '9', then '1' should be appended to `nRow`, otherwise, the element should be appended to `nRow`.

State: **`row` has at least 1 element, `nRow` signifies that at least 3 elements have been processed from `row`, `i` is the third element in `row`**
