Postcondition: ***`i` is updated based on the next element in `row`. If the next element is '9', `nRow` is '1' + `i`, otherwise `nRow` contains the value of the next element. `res` and `row` maintain their initial relationships. This covers all possible scenarios of updating `nRow` based on the value of `i` and the next element in `row`.***
