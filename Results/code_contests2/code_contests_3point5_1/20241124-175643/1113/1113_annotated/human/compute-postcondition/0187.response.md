According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `row`. If there are more elements left in `row` to be processed, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified rows, `i` is the next value, `t` has been incremented to the next value, `nRow` is a string where '9' in the input row has been replaced with '1', `row` is not empty, `nRow` is not an empty string, `row` has at least one '9' to be replaced, and the next element in `row` needs to be processed in the next iteration. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is concatenated with `i`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1`, `i` is the next value, `t` has been incremented to the next value, `nRow` is a string where '9' in the input row has been replaced with '1`, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is not an empty string, `row` has at least one '9' to be replaced, the next element in `row` needs to be processed in the next iteration.**
