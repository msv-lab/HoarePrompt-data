Example Answer: 
`nRow` is concatenated with '1', which means '1' is added at the end of the existing value in `nRow`. The possible values of `nRow` can be '11' or '21' depending on the initial value of `nRow`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` contains either '11' or '21', `row` has more elements.
Output State: **`res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` contains either '11' or '21', `row` has more elements**
