Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1', `i` is the next value, `t` has been incremented to the next value, `nRow` is a string where '9' in the input row has been replaced with '1', `row` is not empty, `nRow` is not an empty string, `row` has at least one '9' to be replaced. If `i` is '9', then '1' is added to `nRow`; if `i` is not '9', then `i` is added to `nRow`. If `row` does not contain any '9', the loop will not execute and `nRow` will remain the same as input.**
