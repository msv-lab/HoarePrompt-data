Postcondition: ***`res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` contains either '1' or the value of `i`, `row` has more elements. If the value of `i` is '9', then `nRow` contains '1'. If the value of `i` is not '9', then `nRow` contains the concatenated value of `i`. Additionally, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is appended with the value of `i` and `i` is concatenated to `nRow`.***
