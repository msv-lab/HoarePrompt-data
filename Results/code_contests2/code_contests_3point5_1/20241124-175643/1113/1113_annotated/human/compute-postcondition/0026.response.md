Output State: **If `row` is not an empty string, the loop will iterate over each character in `row`. For each character, if it is '9', '1' will be appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the character itself will be appended to `nRow`. After the loop finishes, `nRow` will contain the modified version of `row` based on the condition. If `row` is an empty string or does not contain any '9' characters, `nRow` will be an exact copy of `row`.**
