Postcondition: ***`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is less than the length of `row`, `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not an empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` has been concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by `i`.***
