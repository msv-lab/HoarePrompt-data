According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` contains at least one element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0 and `nRow` is an empty string do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted to `res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is 0, `t` is less than `T`, `row` contains the stripped input value with at least one element, `nRow` is an empty string.
State: **`res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is 0, `t` is less than `T`, `row` contains the stripped input value with at least one element, `nRow` is an empty string**
