According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and less than 9. So `i` needs to be adjusted to be one more than the previous value but still less than 9. The other conditions are that `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i` and `row`, `row` is not empty, and `i` is not equal to '9'. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains the appended value of `nRow`, `i` is one more than the previous value and less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated based on `row`, `row` is not empty, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
