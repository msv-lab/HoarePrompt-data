Postcondition: ***`res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` contains either '11' or '21' if `i` is '9', else `nRow` contains either '1' or the concatenated value of `i`, `row` has more elements. In the if part, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. In the else part, `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`.***
