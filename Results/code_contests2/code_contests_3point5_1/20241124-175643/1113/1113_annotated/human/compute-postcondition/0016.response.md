Postcondition: ***`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not an empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`.***
