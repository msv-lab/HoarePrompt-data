Postcondition: ***`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `nRow` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not an empty string. If `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`.***
