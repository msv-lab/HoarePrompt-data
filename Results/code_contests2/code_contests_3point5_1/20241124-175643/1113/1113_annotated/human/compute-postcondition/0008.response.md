According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range from 0 to 8 (inclusive). Given that `i` is the loop variable, it will automatically be adjusted as the loop executes. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted before the loop starts are:
State: **`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0**
