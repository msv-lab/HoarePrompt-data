Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1', so if it previously contained modified rows where '9' was replaced with '1', it will now have those rows with an additional '1' at the end. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1', `i` is incremented and less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated based on the condition of replacing '9' with '1' and now it also has an additional '1', `row` is not empty, `t` has been incremented to the next value, and `nRow` is not an empty string.
Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1', `i` is incremented and less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated based on the condition of replacing '9' with '1' and now it also has an additional '1', `row` is not empty, `t` has been incremented to the next value, and `nRow` is not an empty string**
