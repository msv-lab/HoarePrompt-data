Example Answer:
The updated row `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. This operation does not change the values of `i`, `t`, or `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is equal to the number of elements in `row`, `t` is less than `T`, and `nRow` contains the updated string based on the conditions.
Output State: **`res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is equal to the number of elements in `row`, `t` is less than `T`, and `nRow` contains the updated string based on the conditions**
