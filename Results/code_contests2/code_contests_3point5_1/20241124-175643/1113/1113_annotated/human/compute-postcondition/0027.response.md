Example Answer:
If `row` contains '9' characters, they will be replaced by '1' in `nRow`. If `row` does not contain '9' characters or is an empty string, `nRow` will be an exact copy of `row`. After appending `nRow` to `res`, the state will be updated accordingly.
Output State: **The loop modifies `row` based on the condition, and `res` contains the appended `nRow`.**
