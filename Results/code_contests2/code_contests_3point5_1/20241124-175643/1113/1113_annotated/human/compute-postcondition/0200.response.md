Functionality: ** The function `func` operates on a 9x9 grid of characters from '1' to '9' for each test case. It reads input rows, replaces '9' with '1', and appends the modified rows to a list `res`. However, the function does not return any value. If there is an invalid input, the `res` list remains empty. **
