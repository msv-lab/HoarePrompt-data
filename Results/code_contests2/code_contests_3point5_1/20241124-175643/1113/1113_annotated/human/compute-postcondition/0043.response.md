Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is the third element in `row`. The initial state indicates that at least 3 elements have been processed from `row`, so `nRow` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` has at least 1 element, `nRow` signifies that at least 3 elements have been processed from `row`, `i` is the third element in `row`.
Output State: **`row` has at least 1 element, `nRow` signifies that at least 3 elements have been processed from `row`, `i` is the third element in `row`**
