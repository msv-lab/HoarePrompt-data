Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1', `i` is incremented and less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated based on the condition of replacing '9' with '1', if `i` is '9', an additional '1' is added to `nRow`, `row` is not empty, `t` has been incremented to the next value, and `nRow` is not an empty string. If `i` is '9', an extra '1' is appended to `nRow`.***
