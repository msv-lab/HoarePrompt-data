Example Answer:
`nRow` is assigned an empty string. The values of `i` is 9, `nRow` is an empty string, and `res` is dependent on the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 9, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` is dependent on the input.
Output State: **`i` is 9, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` is dependent on the input**
