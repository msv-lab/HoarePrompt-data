Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the character '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but after the operation, `nRow` will have an additional '1' at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is less than `T`, `row` contains the stripped input value with at least one element, `nRow` is adjusted based on the value of `i`.
Output State: **`res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is less than `T`, `row` contains the stripped input value with at least one element, `nRow` is adjusted based on the value of `i`**
