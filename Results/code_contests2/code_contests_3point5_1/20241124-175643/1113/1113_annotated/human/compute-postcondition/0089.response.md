Output State: **If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute. If `row` is not empty, for each element in `row`, if the element is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the element itself is appended to `nRow`. After the loop, `res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is equal to the number of elements in `row`, `t` is less than `T`, and `nRow` contains the updated string based on the conditions.**
