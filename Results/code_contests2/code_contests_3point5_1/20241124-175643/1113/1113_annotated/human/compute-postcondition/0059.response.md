Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous value of `nRow` depends on the next element in `row`. If the next element is '9', then `nRow` becomes '1' + `i`. Otherwise, `nRow` becomes the value of the next element in `row` + `i`. The states of `res` and `row` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is updated based on the next element in `row`; if the next element is '9', `nRow` is '1' + `i`, otherwise `nRow` contains the value of the next element; `res` and `row` maintain their initial relationships.
Output State: **`i` is updated based on the next element in `row`; if the next element is '9', `nRow` is '1' + `i`, otherwise `nRow` contains the value of the next element; `res` and `row` maintain their initial relationships**
