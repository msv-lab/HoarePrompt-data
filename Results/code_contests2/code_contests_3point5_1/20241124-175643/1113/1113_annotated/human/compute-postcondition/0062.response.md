Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its current value. Since the initial state of `nRow` is unknown, the new value of `nRow` is '1'. The values of `i`, `res`, and `row` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `nRow` is '1', `res` and `row` maintain their initial relationships**
