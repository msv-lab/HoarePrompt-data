According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 9, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` contains either '11' or '21' if `i` is '9', else `nRow` contains either '1' or the concatenated value of `i`, and `row` has more elements.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `i` is the loop variable, it needs to be updated to the next value that allows the loop to continue, which is the next element in `row`.
- The value of `nRow` needs to be updated based on the condition. If `i` is '9' in the if part, then `nRow` should be concatenated with '1'. If `i` is not '9' in the else part, then `nRow` should be concatenated with the value of `i`.

State: **`res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is the next element in `row`, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated based on the condition, `row` has more elements.**
