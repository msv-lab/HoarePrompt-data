Example Answer:
The standard output is redirected to an `io.BytesIO` object using the `atexit.register` function. This allows capturing the standard output in the `io.BytesIO` object for later use. This statement does not directly change the state of any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: The standard output is now redirected to an `io.BytesIO` object.
Output State: **The standard output is now redirected to an `io.BytesIO` object**
