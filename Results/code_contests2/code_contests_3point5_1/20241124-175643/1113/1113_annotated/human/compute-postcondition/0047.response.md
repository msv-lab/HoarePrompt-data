Example Answer:
The modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1' is appended to the list `res`. If `row` is not empty, `nRow` will contain the modified version, otherwise `nRow` will remain an empty string. Therefore, the Output State is: If `row` is not empty, `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1'. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string and is appended to `res`.
Output State: **If `row` is not empty, `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1'. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string and is appended to `res`**
