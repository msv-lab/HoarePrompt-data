According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `row` and the relationship between `i` and the next element in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated accordingly, and `res` and `row` maintain their initial relationships. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `row` needs to be considered. If the next element is '9', then `nRow` should be '1' + `i`, otherwise `nRow` should contain the value of the next element. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
State: **`i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `res` and `row` maintain their initial relationships**
