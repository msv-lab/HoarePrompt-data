According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, no specific information is provided about the values of `row` and `res`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the value of `i` to be less than 9.
State: **No specific adjustments needed**
