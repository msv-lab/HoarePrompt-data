According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1', `i` is the next value, `t` has been incremented to the next value, `nRow` is a string where '9' in the input row has been replaced with '1', `row` is not empty, `nRow` is not an empty string, `row` has at least one '9' to be replaced.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` needs to be incremented to the next value.
2. `nRow` needs to be updated based on the value of `i` according to the condition mentioned.
State: **`res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1', `i` is the next value, `t` has been incremented to the next value, `nRow` is a string where '9' in the input row has been replaced with '1', `row` is not empty, `nRow` is not an empty string, `row` has at least one '9' to be replaced.**
