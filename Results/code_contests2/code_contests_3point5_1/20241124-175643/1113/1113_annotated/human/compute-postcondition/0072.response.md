Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the stripped input value. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is 0, `t` is less than `T`, and `row` contains the stripped input value.
Output State: **`res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is 0, `t` is less than `T`, `row` contains the stripped input value**
