According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `t` is less than `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1', `i` is incremented and is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated based on the condition of replacing '9' with '1', `row` is not empty. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be incremented to the next value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1', `i` is incremented and is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated based on the condition of replacing '9' with '1', `row` is not empty, `t` has been incremented to the next value**
