According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has a relationship with `nRow`, `res`, and `row` that needs to be maintained. Since there are no specific requirements mentioned for adjusting these relationships, they will remain the same. The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`, which needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `nRow`, `res`, and `row` maintain their initial relationships**
