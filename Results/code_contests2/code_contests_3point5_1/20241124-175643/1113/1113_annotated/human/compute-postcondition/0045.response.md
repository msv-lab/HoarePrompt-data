According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` has at least 1 element. If `i` is '9', `nRow` signifies that at least 4 elements have been processed from `row` and '1' is appended to `nRow'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` signifies that at least 3 elements have been processed from `row` and `i` is appended to `nRow`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the adjustment needed is based on the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', then at least 5 elements need to be processed from `row` and '1' needs to be appended to `nRow'. If `i` is not '9', then at least 4 elements need to be processed from `row` and the value of `i` needs to be appended to `nRow`.

State: **`row` has at least 1 element. If `i` is '9', `nRow` signifies that at least 5 elements have been processed from `row` and '1' is appended to `nRow'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` signifies that at least 4 elements have been processed from `row` and `i` is appended to `nRow**`.
