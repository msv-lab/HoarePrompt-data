Postcondition: ***`i`, `nRow`, `res`, `row` are strings. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1' while maintaining the initial relationships between `res` and `row`. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, still maintaining the initial relationships between `res` and `row`.***
