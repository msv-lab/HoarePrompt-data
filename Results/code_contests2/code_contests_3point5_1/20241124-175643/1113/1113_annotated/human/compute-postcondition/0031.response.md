According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `row`. Since `row` is assigned the stripped input value, it should have at least one element for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `nRow` is an empty string, so it needs to be adjusted to signify that at least one element has been processed from `row`. Additionally, `i` should be the first element in `row`.

State: **`row` has at least 1 element, `nRow` signifies that at least 1 element has been processed from `row`, `i` is the first element in `row`**
