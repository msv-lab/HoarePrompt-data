According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is incremented by 1 and less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`, `i` is incremented by 1 and less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is the value of `row` with an additional '1' if `i` was equal to '9', otherwise `nRow` is the sum of `row` and `i`, `row` is not empty, and `i` is not equal to '9'. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 but still less than 9.
- If `i` was equal to '9' in the previous iteration, `nRow` should have an additional '1' added to the value. Otherwise, `nRow` should be the sum of `row` and `i`.

State: **`res` contains the appended value of `nRow`, `i` is incremented by 1 and less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is adjusted based on the above conditions, `row` is not empty**
