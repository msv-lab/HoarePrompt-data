Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1', `i` is the next value, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated based on the condition of replacing '9' with '1', `row` is not empty, `t` has been incremented to the next value, `nRow` is not an empty string, if `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`, if `i` is not equal to '9', the current value of `i` is concatenated to the existing value of `nRow`, if the input row does not contain any '9', `res` will be the same as the input row and `nRow` will be equal to the input row, `i` is the next value, and `i` is equal to '9`***
