According to the code, the loop can execute if the input integer `T` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')` and `res` is an empty list. To ensure the loop executes, `T` needs to be greater than 0 and `t` is 0.
State: **`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0**
