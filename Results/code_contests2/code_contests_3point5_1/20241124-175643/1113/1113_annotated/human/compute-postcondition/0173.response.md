Output State: **`res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1', `i` is the next value, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated based on the condition of replacing '9' with '1' or concatenating the current value of `i`, `row` is not empty, `t` has been incremented to the next value, `nRow` is not an empty string. If the input row does not contain any '9', `res` and `nRow` will be equal to the input row. Finally, `i` is the next value after the loop execution. If the input row is empty, the loop will not execute and `res`, `nRow`, and `i` will remain unchanged.**
