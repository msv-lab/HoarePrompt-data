According to the code, the loop can execute 9 times as it iterates over the range of 9. At the end of the last iteration, if `row` is not empty, `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1'. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string and is appended to `res`. Since the loop can execute 9 times, the only state that needs adjustment is `i`. It should be updated to 9 to indicate that the loop will execute one more time.
State: **If `row` is not empty, `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1'. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string and is appended to `res`, `i` is 9**
