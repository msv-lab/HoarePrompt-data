Postcondition: ***`row` has at least 1 element, `nRow` signifies that at least 2 elements have been processed from `row`, `i` is the second element in `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, `i` is appended to `nRow`. In both cases, the state of `nRow` reflects the processing of elements from `row`.***
