Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows, `i` is the next value, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated by adding '1' at the end if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is updated based on the condition of replacing '9' with '1' and then concatenated with `i`, `row` is not empty, `t` has been incremented to the next value, `nRow` is not an empty string. This postcondition covers all cases where `i` can be '9' or any other value, ensuring the appropriate modification of `nRow` and the correct increment of `t` while maintaining the integrity of `res` and `row`.***
