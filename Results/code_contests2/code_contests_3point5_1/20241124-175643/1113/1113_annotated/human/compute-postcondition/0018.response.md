Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so after execution, `nRow` will have the value of the previous `nRow` with '1' appended to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is less than the length of `row`, `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not an empty string, `nRow` has been concatenated with '1'.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is less than the length of `row`, `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not an empty string, `nRow` has been concatenated with '1'**
