Example Answer:
The `input` function is reassigned to read from an `io.BytesIO` object created by reading from standard input. This allows input to be read from the specified `io.BytesIO` object instead of directly from the console. No other variables are affected by this reassignment.
Output State: **The standard output is now redirected to an `io.BytesIO` object**
