According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 9, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` contains either '1' or the value of `i`, `row` has more elements. If the value of `i` is '9', then `nRow` contains '1'. If the value of `i` is not '9', then `nRow` contains the concatenated value of `i`. Additionally, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is appended with the value of `i` and `i` is concatenated to `nRow`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be less than 9. The other states do not need adjustment for the loop to execute again.
State: **`res` contains at least one modified row, `i` is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` contains either '1' or the concatenated value of `i`, `row` has more elements**
