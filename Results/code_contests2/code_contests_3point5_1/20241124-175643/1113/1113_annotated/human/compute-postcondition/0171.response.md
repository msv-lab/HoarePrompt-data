According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i`, `t`, `T`, and the conditions of updating `nRow`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the modified rows, `i` is the next value, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated by adding '1' at the end if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is updated based on the condition of replacing '9' with '1' and then concatenated with `i`, `row` is not empty, `t` has been incremented to the next value, `nRow` is not an empty string. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `i` needs to be updated to the next value.
2. `t` needs to be incremented to the next value.
3. `nRow` needs to be updated according to the specified conditions.
4. `row` needs to remain not empty.
5. `nRow` should not be an empty string.

State: **`res` contains the modified rows, `i` is the next value, `t` is incremented to the next value, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is not an empty string.**
