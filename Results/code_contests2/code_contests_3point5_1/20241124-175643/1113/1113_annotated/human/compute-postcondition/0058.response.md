Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the string '1'. Since there is no mention of the next element being '9', the value of `nRow` is dependent on the previous value of `nRow`. The relationships between `res` and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is updated based on the next element in `row`. If the next element is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the value of the next element. `res` and `row` maintain their initial relationships as described in the precondition.
