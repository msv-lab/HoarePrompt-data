Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it. The initial relationship between `i` and the next element in `row` determines the value of `i`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `res` and `row` maintain their initial relationships.
Output State: **`i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `res` and `row` maintain their initial relationships**
