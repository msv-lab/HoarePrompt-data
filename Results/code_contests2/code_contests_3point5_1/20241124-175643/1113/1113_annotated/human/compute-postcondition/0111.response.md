According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `T`. If `i` is less than 9, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`, `i` is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` contains either '1' or the concatenated value of `i`, `row` is not empty.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. If the value of `i` is '9', then `nRow` contains '1' in the next iteration. If the value of `i` is not '9', then `nRow` contains the concatenated value of `i` in the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains the appended value of `nRow`, `i` is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` contains either '1' or the concatenated value of `i`, `row` is not empty, `i` is incremented by 1**
