Example Answer:
The code appends '1' to the string stored in `nRow`. As the initial state mentions `nRow` is an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will contain '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`i` is updated based on the first element in `row` which is '9', `nRow` is '1', `res` is dependent on the input, `row` is an iterable object**
