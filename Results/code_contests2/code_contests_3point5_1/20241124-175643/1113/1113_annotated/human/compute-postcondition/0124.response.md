According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is incremented by 1 and less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`, `i` is incremented by 1 and less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is adjusted based on the above conditions, `row` is not empty. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`; otherwise, `i` is appended to `nRow`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should be less than 9.
- `nRow` needs to be adjusted based on the above conditions.
- `res` should contain the appended value of the updated `nRow`.
- `t` needs to be less than `T`.
- `row` should not be empty.

State: **`res` contains the appended value of updated `nRow`, `i` is incremented by 1 and less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is adjusted based on the above conditions, `row` is not empty**
