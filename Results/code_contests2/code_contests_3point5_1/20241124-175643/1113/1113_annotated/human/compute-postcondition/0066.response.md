Output State: 
- If `row` is an iterable object with at least one element, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `nRow` will contain the concatenation of '1' for every occurrence of '9' in `row`, while keeping other characters intact. `i` will reflect the value of the last element in `row`. `res` is dependent on the input, and `row` remains unchanged.
- If `row` is an empty iterable object, the loop will not execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string. `i` will retain its initial value of 9, and `res` will maintain its dependency on the input.
- In all cases, `i`, `nRow`, `res`, and `row` will maintain their initial relationships as described in the precondition.
