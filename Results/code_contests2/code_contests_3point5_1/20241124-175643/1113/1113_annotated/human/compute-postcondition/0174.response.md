According to the code, the loop can execute 9 times with values of `i` ranging from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be updated to the next value after the last iteration.
- `t` needs to be incremented to the next value.
- `nRow` needs to be updated based on the condition of replacing '9' with '1' or concatenating the current value of `i`.
- `row` needs to remain not empty.
- `res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1'.
- `nRow` is not an empty string.

State: **`res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1', `i` is the next value, `t` has been incremented to the next value, `nRow` is updated based on the condition of replacing '9' with '1' or concatenating the current value of `i`, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is not an empty string**
