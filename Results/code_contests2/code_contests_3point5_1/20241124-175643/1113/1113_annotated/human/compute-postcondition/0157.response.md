According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the conditions need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1', `i` is the next value, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated based on the condition of replacing '9' with '1', `row` is not empty, `t` has been incremented to the next value, `nRow` is not an empty string, if `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`, if `i` is not equal to '9', the current value of `i` is concatenated to the existing value of `nRow`, if the input row does not contain any '9', `res` will be the same as the input row and `nRow` will be equal to the input row, `i` is the next value**.
