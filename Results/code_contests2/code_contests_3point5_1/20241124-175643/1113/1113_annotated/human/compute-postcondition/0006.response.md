Example Answer:
`T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. `maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, and `res` is an empty list. Therefore, the output state is: `maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `res` is an empty list, and `T` is an input integer.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer**
