Postcondition: ***`res` contains the modified rows, `i` is the next value, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated based on the condition of replacing '9' with '1', `row` is not empty, `t` has been incremented to the next value, `nRow` is not an empty string. If `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, `i` is concatenated with `nRow`.***
