According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row` and how `nRow` is updated. At the end of the last iteration, `row` has at least 1 element, `nRow` signifies that at least 1 element has been processed from `row`, and `i` is the first element in `row`. If the first element `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is updated to '01'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `row` must still have at least 1 element, `nRow` should indicate that at least one more element needs to be processed from `row`, and `i` should be the next element in `row`.

State: **`row` has at least 1 element, `nRow` signifies that at least 2 elements have been processed from `row`, `i` is the second element in `row`**
