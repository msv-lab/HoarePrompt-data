Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with '1', so if `nRow` was '0' initially, it becomes '01'. The value of `i` is not affected, and `i` remains as '9'. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` has at least 1 element, `nRow` signifies that at least 1 element has been processed from `row`, `i` is the first element in `row`, and the first element `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '01'.
Output State: **`row` has at least 1 element, `nRow` signifies that at least 1 element has been processed from `row`, `i` is the first element in `row`, and the first element `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '01'**
