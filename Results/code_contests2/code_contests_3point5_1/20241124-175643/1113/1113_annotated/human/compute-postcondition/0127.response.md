Postcondition: ***`res` contains the appended value of updated `nRow`, `i` is incremented by 1 and less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is adjusted based on the above conditions, `row` is not empty. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`, otherwise, the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`. The state remains consistent across all conditions and edge cases.***
