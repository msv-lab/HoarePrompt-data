According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not an empty string, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `nRow` is an empty string do not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not an empty string and `i` is 0.
State: **`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not an empty string, `nRow` is an empty string**
