According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. 
Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`res` contains the modified rows where every '9' in the input row is replaced with '1', `i` is incremented and is less than 9, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated based on the condition of replacing '9' with '1', `row` is not empty, `t` has been incremented to the next value**
