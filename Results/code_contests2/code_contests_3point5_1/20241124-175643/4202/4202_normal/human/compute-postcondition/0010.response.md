According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters in the input string. For the loop to execute, `raw_input()` should not be an empty string. The variables to adjust before the loop starts are `a` and `b` to be valid 01-strings, `pa` should be the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` should be 0, and `i` should be the first character in the input string.

State: **`a` and `b` are valid 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the first character in the input string, `pb` is 0**
