According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the input string. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are valid 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the first character in the input string, `pb` is 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the input string must have at least one more character left, and the next character should be assigned to `i`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`a` and `b` are valid 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the next character in the input string, `pb` is 1**
