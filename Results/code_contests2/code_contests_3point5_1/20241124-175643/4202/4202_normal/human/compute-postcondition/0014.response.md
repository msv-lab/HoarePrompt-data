According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the input string. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are valid 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the next character in the input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next character `i` needs to be available in the input string. So, `i` should be the next character after the one processed in the previous iteration. 

State: **`a` and `b` are valid 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the next character in the input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'**
