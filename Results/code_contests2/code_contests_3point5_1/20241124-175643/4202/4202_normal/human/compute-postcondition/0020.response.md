Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over two input strings `a` and `b`, counting the occurrences of '1' in each string. Then, it prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string `a` is greater than or equal to the count of '1's in the second string `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function assumes that `a` and `b` are valid 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only "0" and "1" characters.**
