According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left to iterate over in the input string. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a 01-string of length between 1 and 1000, `b` is a 01-string of length between 1 and 1000, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the next character to be iterated over in the input string. To execute one more time, the next character `i` should be within the input string length. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` is the next character to be iterated over in the input string.
State: **`a` is a 01-string of length between 1 and 1000, `b` is a 01-string of length between 1 and 1000, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the next character to be iterated over in the input string**
