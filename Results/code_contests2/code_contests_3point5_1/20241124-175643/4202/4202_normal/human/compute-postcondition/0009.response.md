Example Answer:
`pb` is assigned the value `0`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only "0" and "1" characters, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the current character being iterated over in the input string, `pb` is 0.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only "0" and "1" characters, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the current character being iterated over in the input string, `pb` is 0**
