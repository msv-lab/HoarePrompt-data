According to the code, the loop will execute one more time if there are more characters left to iterate over in the input string. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a 01-string of length between 1 and 1000, `b` is a 01-string of length between 1 and 1000, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the current character being iterated over in the input string. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next character in the input string needs to be available. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`a` is a 01-string of length between 1 and 1000, `b` is a 01-string of length between 1 and 1000, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the next character to be iterated over in the input string**
