Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It calculates the parity of both strings a and b, and then compares the number of '1's in each string to determine if it is possible to turn string a into string b. The program outputs "YES" if it is possible, and "NO" otherwise. The program handles all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
