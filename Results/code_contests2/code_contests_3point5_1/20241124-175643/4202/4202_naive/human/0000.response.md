Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the parity of strings `a` and `b` and then prints "YES" if the parity of `a` is greater than or equal to the parity of `b`, and "NO" otherwise. The program follows the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
