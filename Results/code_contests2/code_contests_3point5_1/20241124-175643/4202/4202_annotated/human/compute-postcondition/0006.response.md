Example Answer: 
If the value of `i` is '1', then `pa` will be incremented by 1. If the previous value of `pa` is unknown and `i` is '1', then `pa` will be 1 after execution. If the value of `i` is not '1', then `pa` will remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `pa` is increased by 1 if `i` is '1'.
Output State: **variable `pa` is increased by 1 if `i` is '1'**
