According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string. If there are more characters in the input string, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` remains unchanged, and `pb` represents the index of the first character in the input incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the next character in the input. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `pb` should be adjusted accordingly based on the next character in the input string.
State: **`pa` remains unchanged, `pb` represents the index of the first character in the input incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the next character in the input**
