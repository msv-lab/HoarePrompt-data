Example Answer: 
The value of `pa` remains unchanged, and `pb` is calculated as the index of the first character in the input incremented by the total number of occurrences of '1' in the input string. Based on these values, the conditional statement checks if `pa` is greater than or equal to `pb` and prints 'NO' if false and 'YES' if true. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` remains unchanged, `pb` is calculated based on the input string, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the comparison.
Output State: **`pa` remains unchanged, `pb` is calculated based on the input string, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the comparison**
