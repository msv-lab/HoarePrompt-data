The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function takes the 01-strings `a` and `b` as input, where both `a` and `b` are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" of lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The function then performs a certain operation based on the input strings `a` and `b` and returns a specific output.
