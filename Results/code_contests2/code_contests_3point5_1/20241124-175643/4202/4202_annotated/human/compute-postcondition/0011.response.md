Example Answer:
The value of `i` is checked if it is equal to '1', and if true, `pb` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pb` is unknown, so the output state is: `pa` remains unchanged, `pb` represents the index of the first character in the input incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in `i`.
Output State: **`pa` remains unchanged, `pb` represents the index of the first character in the input incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in `i`**
