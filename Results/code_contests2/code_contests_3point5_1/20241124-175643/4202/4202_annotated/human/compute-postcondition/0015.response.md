Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` in the input is '1'. The initial state of `pa` remains unchanged, and the initial state of `pb` is the index of the first character in the input. After execution, `pb` is incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the next character in the input.
Output State: **`pa` remains unchanged, `pb` represents the index of the first character in the input incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the next character in the input**
