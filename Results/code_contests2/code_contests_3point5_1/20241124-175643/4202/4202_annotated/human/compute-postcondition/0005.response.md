According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input provided by the user. If the input contains the character '1', the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, variable `pa` is increased by 1 if `i` is '1'. So for the loop to execute one more time, the input provided by the user must contain the character '1'.
State: **variable `pa` is increased by 1 if `i` is '1'**
