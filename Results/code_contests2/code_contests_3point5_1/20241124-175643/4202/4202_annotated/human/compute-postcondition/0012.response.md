According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the input string. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` remains unchanged, and `pb` represents the index of the first character in the input incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in `i`. To execute the loop one more time, the input string must have at least one more character, and the value of `pb` should be adjusted based on the next character in the input string.
State: **`pa` remains unchanged, `pb` represents the index of the first character in the input incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the next character in the input**
