Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It takes two input strings, `a` and `b`, which consist of only "0" and "1" characters with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusively. The function then counts the occurrences of '1' in both strings `a` and `b` separately and compares them. Finally, it prints either 'NO' or 'YES' based on whether the count of '1's in `a` is greater than or equal to the count of '1's in `b`.**
