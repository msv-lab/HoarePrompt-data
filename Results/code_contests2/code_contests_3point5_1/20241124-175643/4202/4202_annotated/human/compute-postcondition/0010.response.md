According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input provided by the user. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as there is at least one character in the input. Before the loop starts, `pa` remains unchanged does not affect the loop execution, but `pb` being 0 does not guarantee the loop execution. To ensure the loop executes, `pb` needs to be adjusted to represent the index of the first character in the input.
State: **`pa` remains unchanged, `pb` represents the index of the first character in the input**
