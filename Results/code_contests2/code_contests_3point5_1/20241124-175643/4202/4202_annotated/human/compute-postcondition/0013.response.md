Example Answer: 
The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` in the input is '1'. The initial state of `pb` is the index of the first character in the input incremented by the occurrences of '1'. After executing the code, the final state will be based on the input and the occurrences of '1'. 
Output State: **`pa` remains unchanged, `pb` represents the index of the first character in the input incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the next character in the input**
