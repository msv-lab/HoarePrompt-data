According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input provided by the user in the raw_input(). If the input contains '1', the variable `pa` is increased by 1. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `pa` is increased by 1 if `i` is '1'. To execute the loop one more time, the input provided by the user must contain '1' and the variable `pa` needs to be adjusted accordingly.
State: **variable `pa` is increased by 1 if `i` is '1'**
