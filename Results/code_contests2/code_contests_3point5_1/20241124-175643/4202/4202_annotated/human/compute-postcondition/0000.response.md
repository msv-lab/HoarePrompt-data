Example Answer:
`pa` is assigned the value `0`. Since `pa` is a variable representing a probability of a being 1, the value `0` implies that the probability of `a` being 1 is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition**: **a and b are 01-strings of lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only the characters "0" and "1".**; `pa` is 0.
Output State: **Precondition**: **a and b are 01-strings of lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only the characters "0" and "1".**; `pa` is 0.
