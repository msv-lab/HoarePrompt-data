According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input string. If there are more characters in the input string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` remains unchanged, `pb` represents the index of the first character in the input incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the next character in the input. So for the loop to execute one more time, `pb` needs to be adjusted based on the next character in the input.
State: **`pa` remains unchanged, `pb` represents the index of the first character in the input incremented by the number of occurrences of '1' in the next character in the input**
