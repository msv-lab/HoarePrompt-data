Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the parity of the input strings a and b by counting the occurrences of '1'. It then compares the parities and prints "YES" if it is possible to turn string a into string b, and "NO" otherwise. The program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given examples. Since there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct.
