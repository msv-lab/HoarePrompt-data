Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program only considers the time Luba spends working each day and subtracts it from the total time required to read the book. However, it does not account for the fact that any leftover time after finishing work on a particular day can be used for reading. The program simply increments the day counter without considering the remaining time.

An example where the program fails:
Input:
2 2
1 1

Expected Output:
1

Actual Output:
2

Explanation:
In this case, Luba has 1 second of work on each of the two days. The program should output 1 because Luba can finish reading the book on the first day itself by using the remaining time after work. But the program incorrectly outputs 2.
