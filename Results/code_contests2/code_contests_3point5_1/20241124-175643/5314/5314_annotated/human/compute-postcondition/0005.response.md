According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is positive. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **Output State: n and t are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6. ai is a non-negative integer representing the time Luba has to spend working during the i-th day, and each ai is less than or equal to 86400. i is incremented by 1, and t is decremented by the difference between 86400 and a[i]**
