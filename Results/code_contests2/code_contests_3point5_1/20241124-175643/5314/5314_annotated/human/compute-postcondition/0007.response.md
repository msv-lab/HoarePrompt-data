Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `t` is decremented by the difference between 86400 and a[i]. The values of `n`, `t`, and `ai` are not specified. Therefore, the output state is: n and t are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6. ai is a non-negative integer representing the time Luba has to spend working during the i-th day, and each ai is less than or equal to 86400. i is increased by 1, and t is decreased by the difference between 86400 and a[i].
