Example Answer:
The value of t is modified by subtracting 86400 minus a[i] where a[i] represents the time Luba has to spend working on the i-th day. Since a[i] is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 86400, the value being subtracted will always be non-negative. Therefore, t is decremented by a non-negative value. The value of i is incremented by 1. 
Output State: **n and t are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6. ai is a non-negative integer representing the time Luba has to spend working during the i-th day, and each ai is less than or equal to 86400. i is incremented by 1, and t is decremented by the difference between 86400 and a[i]**.
