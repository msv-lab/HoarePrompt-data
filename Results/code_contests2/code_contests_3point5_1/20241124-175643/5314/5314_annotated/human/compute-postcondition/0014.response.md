The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the total time Luba has to spend working over n days, where n is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The total time is calculated by summing up the time Luba has to spend working during each day, represented by the non-negative integers ai, such that each ai is less than or equal to 86400. The function then returns the total time Luba has to spend working over n days.
