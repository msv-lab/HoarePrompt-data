According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `t` are positive integers, and `ai` represents the time Luba has to spend working during the i-th day. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be adjusted to be greater than the time taken for the next day of work, which is 86400 - a[i]. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n and t are positive integers, ai represents the time Luba has to spend working during the i-th day, and t is greater than 86400 - ai**
