Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 - `a[i]`, where `a[i]` represents the time Luba has to spend working during the i-th day. Since `t` is greater than 86400 - `a[i]`, the result will be positive. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are positive integers, ai represents the time Luba has to spend working during the i-th day, and t is greater than 86400 - ai, and t is updated accordingly.
Output State: **n and t are positive integers, ai represents the time Luba has to spend working during the i-th day, and t is greater than 86400 - ai, and t is updated accordingly**
