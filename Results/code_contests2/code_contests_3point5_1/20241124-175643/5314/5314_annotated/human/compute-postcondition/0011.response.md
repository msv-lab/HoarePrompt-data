According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 86400 - `ai`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be updated to be greater than 86400 - `ai`. Additionally, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **n and t are positive integers, ai represents the time Luba has to spend working during the i-th day, t is greater than 86400 - ai, t is updated accordingly, i is increased by 1**
