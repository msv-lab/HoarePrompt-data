The function `func` reads input values for `n` and `t`, as well as a list `a`. It then iterates through the elements of `a` subtracting each element from `t` until `t` is less than 86400. The function prints the number of elements processed (`i`) during the iteration. The function does not explicitly return any value. Potential edge cases and missing logic include ensuring that the input values meet the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, handling cases where the loop does not execute, and addressing any potential issues with the input data.
