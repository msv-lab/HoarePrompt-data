According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **Output State: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input split values, `i` is 3, and the updated value of `t` is greater than 0**
