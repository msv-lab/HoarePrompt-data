According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is positive. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `t` needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input split values, `i` is 1, and the updated value of `t` is greater than 0**
