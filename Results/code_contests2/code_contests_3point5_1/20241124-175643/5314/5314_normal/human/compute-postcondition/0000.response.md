Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values from the list returned by `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`. The input is split by spaces, converted to integers, and stored in `n` and `t`. The values of `n` and `t` are positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6**
