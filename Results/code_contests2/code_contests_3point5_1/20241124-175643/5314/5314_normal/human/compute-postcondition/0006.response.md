Example Answer:
`t` is decreased by the value of 86400 - `int(a[i])`, where `a` is a list containing the input split values and `i` is 1. The value of `t` is updated to be greater than 0. 
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input split values, `i` is 1, and the updated value of `t` is greater than 0**
