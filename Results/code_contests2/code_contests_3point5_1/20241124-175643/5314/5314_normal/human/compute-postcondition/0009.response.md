Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 - `int(a[i])`. The value of `a[i]` is retrieved from the list `a`. The updated value of `t` will be greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input split values, `i` is 2, and the updated value of `t` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input split values, `i` is 2, and the updated value of `t` is greater than 0**
