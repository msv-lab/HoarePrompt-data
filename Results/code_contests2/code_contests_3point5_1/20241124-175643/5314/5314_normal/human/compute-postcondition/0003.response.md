Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 from it and then adding the integer value of `a[i]`. The previous values of `t` and `i` are used in the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input split values, `i` is 0, and the updated value of `t`.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input split values, `i` is 0, and the updated value of `t`**
