Output State: **If the initial value of t is less than 86400, the loop won't execute, and the value of i will remain 0. If the loop executes at least once, then n and t are positive integers with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, a is a list containing the input split values, i equals the number of times the loop executed, and t is updated to a positive value less than or equal to the initial t value minus 86400.**
