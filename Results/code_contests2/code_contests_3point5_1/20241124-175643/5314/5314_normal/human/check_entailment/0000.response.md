Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

1. The code does not handle the case where Luba can finish reading the book within the same day. For example, if `n = 1` and `t = 100`, the code will output 1 even though Luba can finish reading on the same day.

2. The code does not consider the case where Luba cannot finish reading the book within the given time `t`. For example, if `n = 3`, `t = 200`, and `a = [90000, 90000, 90000]`, the code should output 4 (since Luba cannot finish reading within the given time), but the code will output 3.

3. The code does not account for the constraint that Luba can only finish reading within `n` days. If Luba cannot finish reading within `n` days, the code should output `n` as the minimum number of days to finish reading. For example, if `n = 2`, `t = 200`, and `a = [90000, 90000]`, the code should output 2 (since Luba cannot finish reading within 2 days), but the code will output 3.
