Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It only considers the time Luba has to spend working on each day, but it does not take into account the free time she can use for reading. This means that the program may not output the correct minimum number of days for Luba to finish reading the book.

For example, if the input is:
```
3 5
50000 40000 20000
```
The correct output should be 2 because Luba can finish reading on the second day. However, the given program may not produce the correct output for this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
