Postcondition: ***A + 1, B are elements of list l. ans is 1 if the integer value of A is equal to the integer value of B, 0 otherwise. If C[0] is equal to C[4] and C[1] is equal to C[3], then ans is increased by 2. C is a list of characters representing the string conversion of i, C is assigned the list of characters obtained from converting i to a string. If C[0] is equal to C[4] and C[1] is equal to C[3], ans is increased by 3.***
