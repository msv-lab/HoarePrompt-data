Example Answer:
The list `C` is assigned the string representation of integer `i`. The variables `A`, `B`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is the first element of list `l`, `B` is the second element of list `l`, `ans` is 1 if the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, 0 otherwise.
Output State: **`A` is the first element of list `l`, `B` is the second element of list `l`, `ans` is 1 if the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, 0 otherwise**
