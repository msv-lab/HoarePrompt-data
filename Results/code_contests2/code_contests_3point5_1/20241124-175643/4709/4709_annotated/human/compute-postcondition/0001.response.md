Example Answer: 
The variable `l` is assigned the result of `a.split()`, which splits the string `a` based on whitespace. The initial state contains 3 lines with 3 lowercase English letters each assigned to variable `a`. After splitting each line, `l` will contain a list of 3 elements, each element representing the letters in a line. Therefore, the Output State is: 3 lines, each containing a list of 3 lowercase English letters.
Output State: **3 lines, each containing a list of 3 lowercase English letters**
