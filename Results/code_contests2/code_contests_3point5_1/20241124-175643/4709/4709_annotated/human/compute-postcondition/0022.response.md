Output State: **`A`, `B` are elements of list `l`, `ans` is 1 if the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, 0 otherwise. If the absolute difference between the integer value of `A` and `B` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3]`, then `ans` is increased by the number of times the condition is true during the loop execution. `C` is a list of characters representing the string conversion of `i`.**
