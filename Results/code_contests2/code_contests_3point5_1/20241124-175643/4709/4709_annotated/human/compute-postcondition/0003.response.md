Example Answer: 
`B` is assigned the value of the second element of list `l`, and `A` is assigned the value of the first element of list `l`. The previous value of the list `l` is unknown, so the output state is: the first element of the list `l` is assigned to `A`, `B` is assigned the second element of list `l`.
Output State: **the first element of the list `l` is assigned to `A`, `B` is assigned the second element of list `l`**
