Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters and reads input from the user to populate variables `A` and `B`. It then checks if `A` is equal to `B` and sets `ans` to 1 if they are equal. After that, it iterates through a range from `A` to `B`, converting each number to a list of characters and incrementing `ans` if specific conditions are met. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not explicitly return a value.**
