Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which takes user input as a string. The 3x3 grid elements `c_{ij}` remain as lowercase English letters. Therefore, the Output State is: `c_{ij}` is a lowercase English letter for each element in the 3x3 grid; `a` is a user input string.
Output State: **`c_{ij}` is a lowercase English letter for each element in the 3x3 grid; `a` is a user input string**
