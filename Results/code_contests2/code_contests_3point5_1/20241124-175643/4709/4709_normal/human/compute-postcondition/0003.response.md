Example Answer:
`B` is assigned the value of the second element in list `l`, which is the second word in the input string `a`. The variables `c_{ij}`, `a`, `l`, and `A` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `c_{ij}` is a lowercase English letter for each element in the 3x3 grid; `a` is a user input string, `l` is a list containing the words of the string `a`, `A` is the first word in the list `l`, `B` is the second word in the list `l`.
Output State: **`c_{ij}` is a lowercase English letter for each element in the 3x3 grid; `a` is a user input string, `l` is a list containing the words of the string `a`, `A` is the first word in the list `l`, `B` is the second word in the list `l`**
