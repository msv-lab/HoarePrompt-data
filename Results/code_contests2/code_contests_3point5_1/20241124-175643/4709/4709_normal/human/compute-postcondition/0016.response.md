Postcondition: ***Each element in the 3x3 grid represented by `c_{ij}` is a lowercase English letter. `a` is a user input string. `l` is a list containing the words of `a`. `A` is the first word in `l`. `B` is the updated second word in `l`. If the first and fifth characters in the string representation of `i` are equal, and the second and fourth characters are equal, then `ans` is incremented by 1. This condition covers all possible scenarios after the if else block executes, ensuring the integrity of the program variables based on the given conditions.***
