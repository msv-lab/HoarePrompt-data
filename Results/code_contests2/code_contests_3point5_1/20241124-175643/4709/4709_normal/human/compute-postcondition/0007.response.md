Postcondition: ***Each element in the 3x3 grid represented by `c_{ij}` is a lowercase English letter. `a` is a user input string and `l` is a list containing the words of `a`. `A` is the first word in `l`, `B` is the second word in `l`. If the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
