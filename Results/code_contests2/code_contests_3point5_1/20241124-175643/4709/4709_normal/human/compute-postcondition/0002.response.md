Example Answer:
`A` is assigned the value of the first word in the list `l`, which is `l[0]`. The value of `l` contains the words of the string `a`, and `a` is a user input string. Therefore, the value of `A` depends on the input string and how it is split into words. Other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`c_{ij}` is a lowercase English letter for each element in the 3x3 grid; `a` is a user input string, `l` is a list containing the words of the string `a`, `A` is the first word in the list `l`.**
