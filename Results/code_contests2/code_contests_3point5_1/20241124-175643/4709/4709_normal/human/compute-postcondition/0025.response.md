Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string input from the user, splits it into two words, and compares the integer values of these words. If the integer values are equal, it sets `ans` to 1. Then, it iterates over a range of integers between the two words and increments `ans` based on a specific condition. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.**
