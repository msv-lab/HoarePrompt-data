Postcondition: ***Each element in the 3x3 grid represented by `c_{ij}` is a lowercase English letter, `a` is a user input string, `l` is a list containing the words of `a`, `A` is the first word in `l`, `B` is the next word in `l` after the current `B`, `C` is a list containing the string representation of `i`, and if `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3]`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. This condition covers all possible scenarios where the specified elements in the grid satisfy the conditions for `ans` to be increased by 1.***
