According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `A` and `B`. If `A` is less than `B`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `A` is the first word in `l` and `B` is the updated second word in `l`. To execute the loop one more time, `B` needs to be adjusted to the next word in the list `l` after the current `B`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Each element in the 3x3 grid represented by `c_{ij}` is a lowercase English letter. `a` is a user input string. `l` is a list containing the words of `a`. `A` is the first word in `l`. `B` is the next word in `l` after the current `B`.**
