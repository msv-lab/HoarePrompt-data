Example Answer:
The string `a` is split into a list `l` using the `split()` method. The elements in the list `l` will be the individual words separated by spaces in the string `a`. The variables `c_{ij}` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`c_{ij}` is a lowercase English letter for each element in the 3x3 grid; `a` is a user input string, `l` is a list containing the words of the string `a`**
