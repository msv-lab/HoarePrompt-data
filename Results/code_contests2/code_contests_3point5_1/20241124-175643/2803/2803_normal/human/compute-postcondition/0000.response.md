Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting it. Since the input consists of two integers separated by a space, `n` and `k` will take those values respectively. The values of `n` and `k` can range from 1 to 10^18. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are assigned integer values within the specified range.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned integer values within the specified range**
