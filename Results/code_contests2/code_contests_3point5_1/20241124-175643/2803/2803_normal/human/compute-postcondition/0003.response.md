Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integer inputs `n` and `k` from the user, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. It then calculates and prints the result based on the condition: if k - 1 is true, it calculates and prints 2 raised to the length of the binary representation of n minus 1; otherwise, it prints the value of n. The function does not explicitly return any value. **
