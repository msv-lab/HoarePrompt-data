The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items, where n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18. The return value should be an integer representing the total number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items. 
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items, where n and k are positive integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18.**
