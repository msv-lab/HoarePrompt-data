Functionality: **The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, then calculates and prints the result based on the conditions provided in the code. Specifically, it calculates the number of ways to choose `k` items from a set of `n` items and returns either `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1` or `n` based on the comparison `k - 1`. There is no explicit error handling or edge case consideration in the provided code.**
