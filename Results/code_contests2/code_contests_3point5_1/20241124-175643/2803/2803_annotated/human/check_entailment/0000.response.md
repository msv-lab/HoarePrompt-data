Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly calculates the largest possible xor-sum that Grisha can obtain from the candies based on the problem description. The program takes two integers n and k as input, where n represents the total number of candies and k represents the maximum number of candies Grisha can take. The program then calculates and prints the largest possible xor-sum that Grisha can obtain.

The logic used in the program is to calculate 2 raised to the power of the length of the binary representation of n minus 1 if k-1 is true, otherwise it returns n. This logic is in line with the problem description and correctly calculates the xor-sum based on the constraints provided.

After reviewing the code and considering the problem description, it appears that the program handles all potential cases correctly and provides the expected output. Hence, the correctness of the program is **True**.
