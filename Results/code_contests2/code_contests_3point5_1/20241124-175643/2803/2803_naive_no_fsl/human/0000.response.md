Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the largest possible xor-sum that Grisha can obtain based on the given input values of n and k. It uses a bitwise operation to calculate the xor-sum and returns the expected result for all possible input cases. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description provided.
