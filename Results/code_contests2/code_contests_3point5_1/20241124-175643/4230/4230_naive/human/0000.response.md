Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the smallest index k such that after Mr. Black opened the first k doors, he was able to exit the house. The code iterates through the sequence of opened doors in reverse order and finds the first occurrence where the door locations change from one exit to another. This ensures that Mr. Black opens the doors in such a way that he can exit the house. The logic provided in the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
