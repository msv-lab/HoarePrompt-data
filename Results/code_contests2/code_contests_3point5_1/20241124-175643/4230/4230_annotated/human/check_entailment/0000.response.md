Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the input sequence in reverse order and finds the smallest index k such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first k doors. The program correctly handles the case where the element at index i is not equal to the element at index i + 1, updating the ans variable accordingly. The output is the expected smallest integer k as per the problem description. Since the code works as expected for all test cases, we can conclude that the program is correct.
