Example Answer: 
The variable `c` is assigned the result of applying the `int()` function to each element obtained by splitting the input sequence. Since the initial state mentions `n` as the first element of the list of integers, we can infer that `n` is the first element of the list obtained from the input sequence. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of the list of integers obtained from the input sequence.
Output State: **`n` is the first element of the list of integers obtained from the input sequence**
