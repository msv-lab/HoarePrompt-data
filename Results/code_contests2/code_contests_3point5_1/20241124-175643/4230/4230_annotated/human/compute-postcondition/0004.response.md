According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 3. Before the loop starts, `n` is the first element of the list of integers obtained from the input sequence, so we know it's an integer. For the loop to execute, `n` needs to be at least 3. In addition, `ans` is 0 at the start, so it doesn't affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is 0**
