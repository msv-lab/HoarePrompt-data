According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n` and the condition `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]`. If this condition is met, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `ans` is an integer. So for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]` must be true. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is an integer**
