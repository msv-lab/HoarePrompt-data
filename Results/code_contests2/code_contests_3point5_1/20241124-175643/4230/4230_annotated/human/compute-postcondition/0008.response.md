Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is an integer. If the element at index `i` of list `c` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` and the loop is broken. The postcondition ensures that the values of `n` and `ans` are maintained after the execution of the if statement, covering all possible cases where the condition is met for the if part.***
