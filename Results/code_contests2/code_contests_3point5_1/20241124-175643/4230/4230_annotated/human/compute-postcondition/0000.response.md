Example Answer: 
The variable `n` is assigned the result of mapping each element of the input split by space to an integer. Since the input is read using `raw_input()`, the list of integers obtained from the input is stored in `n`. The size of the list `n` is determined by the number of integers provided in the input. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a list of integers obtained from the input sequence.
Output State: **n is a list of integers obtained from the input sequence**
