According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. This ensures that the loop will execute at least one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is an integer**
