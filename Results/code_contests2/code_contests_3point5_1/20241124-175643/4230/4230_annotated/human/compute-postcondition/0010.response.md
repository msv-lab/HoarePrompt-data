Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is either -1 if the condition in the postcondition is met for the if statement, otherwise, `ans` is assigned `i + 1`. The initial state states that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, so the condition in the postcondition is met for the if statement, and `i` is -1. Therefore, `ans` becomes 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is 0, `i` is -1**
