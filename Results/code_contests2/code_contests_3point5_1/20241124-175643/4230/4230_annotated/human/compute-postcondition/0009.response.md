According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. Since the loop is going in reverse order, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be -1 to go one step further. Additionally, if the condition mentioned in the postcondition is met, `ans` should be updated accordingly.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is an integer, `i` is -1 if the condition in the postcondition is met for the if statement, otherwise adjust `ans` based on the postcondition if needed**
