Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the value of `ans`. It converts the input into a sequence of integers and iterates over the sequence to find the index where the value changes from 0 to 1 or vice versa. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the function updates `ans` to the index where the change occurs. If `n` is less than 3, `ans` remains 0. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific output.**
