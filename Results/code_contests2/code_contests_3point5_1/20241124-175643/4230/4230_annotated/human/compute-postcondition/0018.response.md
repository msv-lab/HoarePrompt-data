Output State: **If n is greater than or equal to 3, the loop will execute at least once. During the loop, if the element at index i of list c is not equal to the element at index i + 1, then ans is updated to i + 1 and the loop breaks. The postcondition ensures that the values of n and ans are maintained after the execution of the if statement. If n is less than 3, the loop does not execute, and ans remains 0.**
