Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the smallest index k such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first k doors. It iterates through the sequence in reverse order and finds the index where the doors switch from one exit to another, which indicates that Mr. Black can exit the house at that point. The program handles all potential cases and the logic is sound.
