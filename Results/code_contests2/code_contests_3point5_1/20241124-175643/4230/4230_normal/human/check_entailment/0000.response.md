Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is designed to work with a minimum value of 2 for `n`, but the problem description specifies that `n` can be as low as 2. This means that the code will not handle cases where `n` is less than 2. Thus, the program is incorrect.
