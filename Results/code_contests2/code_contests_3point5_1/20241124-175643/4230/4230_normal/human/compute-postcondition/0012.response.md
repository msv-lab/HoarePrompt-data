Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is an integer representing the updated index where the elements in array `c` are not equal starting from index n - 2. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
