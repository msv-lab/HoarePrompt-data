Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is an integer representing the index where the elements in array `c` are not equal starting from index n - 2 and decrementing by 1 in each iteration until a mismatch is found. The loop terminates and the function breaks when a mismatch is encountered between the elements at index `i` and index `i + 1`.***
