Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input()` accepts input and `split()` splits the input. `map(int, ...)` converts the input values to integers. The previous value of `n` is unknown, so the output state is `n` contains the first integer extracted from the input.
Output State: **`n` contains the first integer extracted from the input**
