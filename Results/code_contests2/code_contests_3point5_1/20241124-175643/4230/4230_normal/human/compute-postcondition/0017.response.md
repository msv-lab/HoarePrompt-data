According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is equal to 3. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to 0 since it's the next value in the range. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is equal to 3 and `ans` is an integer representing the updated index where the elements in array `c` are not equal starting from index n - 2. If c[i] is not equal to c[i + 1], then `ans` is updated to i + 1 and the loop is exited, `i` is 0**
