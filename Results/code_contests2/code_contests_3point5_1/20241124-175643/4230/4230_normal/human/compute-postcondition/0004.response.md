According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, `n` contains the first integer extracted from the input, this ensures that `n` is at least 1. However, `ans` is 0 does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` should be greater than or equal to 2, `i` should start at `n - 2`, and the loop should iterate backwards.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 2 and decrements by 1 in each iteration**
