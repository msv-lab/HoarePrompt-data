Example Answer: 
The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first element in the sequence of integers extracted from the input. Since we only take the first element, the value of `n` is now that first integer. The other elements in the sequence are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` contains the first integer extracted from the input**
