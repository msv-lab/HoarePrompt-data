Example Answer:
The code `n = map(int, raw_input().split())` maps the input values to integers and stores them in the variable `n`. Since the input is split by spaces and converted to integers, `n` now contains a sequence of integers. The variable `n` now holds the sequence of integers extracted from the input.
Output State: **`n` contains a sequence of integers extracted from the input**
