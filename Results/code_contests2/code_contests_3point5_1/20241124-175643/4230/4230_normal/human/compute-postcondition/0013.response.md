According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. The loop will execute one more time if `n` is equal to 3 and `ans` is not updated such that `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`. If `ans` is updated in the last iteration, then the loop will not execute again.
State: **`n` is equal to 3, `ans` is an integer representing the updated index where the elements in array `c` are not equal starting from index n - 2**
