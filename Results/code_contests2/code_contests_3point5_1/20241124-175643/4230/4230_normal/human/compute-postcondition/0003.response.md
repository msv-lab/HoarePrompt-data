Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the value of 0. Since the value of `ans` is directly set to 0 and no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` contains the first integer extracted from the input, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`n` contains the first integer extracted from the input, `ans` is 0**
