According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. To execute the loop one more time, the loop should continue decrementing `i`, so `n` should be greater than or equal to 3. Additionally, since the loop terminates when a mismatch is found between elements at index `i` and `i + 1`, the state of `ans` should be adjusted to reflect the updated index based on the previous iteration's comparison.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is an integer representing the updated index where the elements in array `c` are not equal starting from index n - 2**
