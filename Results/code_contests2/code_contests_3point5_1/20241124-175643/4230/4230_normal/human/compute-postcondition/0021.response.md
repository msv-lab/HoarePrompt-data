Functionality: **The function takes input from the user, processes it to find the maximum number of consecutive zeros in an array `c`, and prints this maximum number. If the array `c` has no mismatches, the function prints 0. The function works correctly for cases where `n` is at least 2. However, it does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2 as the loop is designed to work with a minimum value of 2 for `n`.**
