Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, but the initial state of `i` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is an integer representing the updated index where the elements in array `c` are not equal starting from index n - 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is an integer representing the updated index where the elements in array `c` are not equal starting from index n - 2**
