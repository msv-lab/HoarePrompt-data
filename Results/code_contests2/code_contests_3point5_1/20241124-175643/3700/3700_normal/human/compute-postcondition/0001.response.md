Example Answer:
The list comprehension `[int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]` converts the input values into a list of integers and then `sum` calculates the sum of those integers. The initial state does not mention any specific values for the input, so the output state will be: H is a positive integer, N is a non-negative integer, and the sum of the input values is stored in variable `s`.
Output State: **H is a positive integer, N is a non-negative integer, and the sum of the input values is stored in variable `s`**
