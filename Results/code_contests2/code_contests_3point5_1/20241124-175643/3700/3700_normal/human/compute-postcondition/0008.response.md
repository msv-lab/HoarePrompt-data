Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads two integers `H` and `N` from the input, then reads `N` integers and calculates their sum stored in variable `s`. If the sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not have specific return values and operates solely based on the input values provided during execution.**
