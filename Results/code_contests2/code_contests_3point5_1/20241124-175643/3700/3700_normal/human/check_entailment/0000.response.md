# Your task:

Problem description: Fennec is fighting with N monsters.

The health of the i-th monster is H_i.

Fennec can do the following two actions:

* Attack: Fennec chooses one monster. That monster's health will decrease by 1.
* Special Move: Fennec chooses one monster. That monster's health will become 0.

There is no way other than Attack and Special Move to decrease the monsters' health.

Fennec wins when all the monsters' healths become 0 or below.

Find the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq K \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq H_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N K
H_1 ... H_N

Output

Print the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning.

### Initial Assessment:
- The problem description is clear and straightforward.
- The code should read the input, process the data, and output the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack before winning.
- We need to check if the code handles all potential cases, especially cases where Fennec can use Special Move at most K times.

### Function 1:
- The function `func_1` is not directly related to the problem description. It is a simple addition function with a conditional check for a provided modulus value.
- This function is not relevant to solving the current problem.

### Function 2:
- The function `func_2` reads the input, calculates the sum of health values, and checks if the total sum is greater than or equal to the target health value.
- It seems like the core function for solving the problem is missing. We need a function that calculates the minimum number of attacks required before winning with the option of using Special Move K times.

### Output hints for Function 2:
- The output hints describe the functionality of `func_2`, which seems to be reading input and checking if the sum of health values is sufficient to win.
- The hints do not provide information on how the code should handle the scenario of using Special Move at most K times, which is crucial for solving the problem.

### Decision:
- Based on the initial assessment, the code provided does not fully implement the solution to the given problem. It lacks the necessary logic to calculate the minimum number of attacks considering the option of using Special Move at most K times.
- Correctness: **False**.
