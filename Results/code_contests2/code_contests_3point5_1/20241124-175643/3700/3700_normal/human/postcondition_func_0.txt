The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and stores it in `c`. If `c` is greater than or equal to the provided `mod` value, it subtracts `mod` from `c`. The function then returns the final value of `c`. The functionality does not cover cases where `mod` is not defined or when `c` is less than `mod` after the subtraction.
