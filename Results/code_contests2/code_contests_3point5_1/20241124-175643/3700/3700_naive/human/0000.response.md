Correctness: **False**

The given program does not solve the problem as described. The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but neither of them is related to the problem description of Fennec fighting monsters. The functions do not take any input related to the health of monsters or the number of special moves available to Fennec. Additionally, the program reads input in a way that does not match the specified input format.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not address the problem of Fennec fighting monsters.
