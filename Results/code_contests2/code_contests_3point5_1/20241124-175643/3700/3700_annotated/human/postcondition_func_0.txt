The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and stores it in `c`. If the sum `c` is greater than or equal to a predefined value `mod`, then `c` is decremented by `mod` before being returned. The function does not handle cases where `mod` is not defined or if `a` or `b` are negative integers. The functionality of the function is to add the input integers `a` and `b`, and adjust the result based on the comparison with `mod`.
