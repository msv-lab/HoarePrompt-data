Postcondition: ***`copya`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `i` are integers. After the execution of the if-else block, the state of the program variables is as follows: `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10 on its current value, `c` is equal to the number of digits in `a`, `ans` is assigned the minimum value between the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of dividing the updated `a` by `b`, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. In the if part, if the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` is assigned the last digit of `a` and `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`. In the else part, if the last digit of `a` is 0, `h` is assigned the last digit of `a` and `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`. All possible scenarios including the edge cases are covered in the postcondition.***
