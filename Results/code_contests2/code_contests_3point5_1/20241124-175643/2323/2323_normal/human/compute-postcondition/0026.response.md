According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `c`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to 1.
State: *`copya`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `i` are integers. After the execution of the if-else block, the state of the program variables is as follows: `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10 on its current value, `c` is equal to the number of digits in `a`, `ans` is assigned the minimum value between the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of dividing the updated `a` by `b`, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1*.
