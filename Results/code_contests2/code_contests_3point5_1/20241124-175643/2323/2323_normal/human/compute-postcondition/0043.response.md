Postcondition: ***`copya`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `i`, `h` are integers. After the execution of the if-else block, `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10 on its current value, `a` is equal to the updated value of `a` after performing integer division by 10, `c` is equal to the number of digits in `a`, `ans` is assigned the minimum value between the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of dividing the updated `a` by `b`, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. In the if part, `h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10, and `ans` is updated accordingly. In the else part, `h` is assigned the value of `a` modulo 10, and `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`.***
