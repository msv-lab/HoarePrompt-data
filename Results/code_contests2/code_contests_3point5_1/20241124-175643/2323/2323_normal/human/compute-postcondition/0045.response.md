Output State: **If copya is greater than 0, after the loop executes, the variables will be as follows: copya is updated by performing integer division by 10 on its current value, a is equal to the updated value of a after performing integer division by 10, c is equal to the number of digits in a, ans is assigned the minimum value between the previous value of ans and the remainder of dividing the updated a by b. If copya is 0 or less, the loop doesn't execute and c remains 0, copya remains 0, ans is the remainder of dividing a by b.**
