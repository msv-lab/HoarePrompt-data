According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as the variable `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` has been updated by performing integer division by 10 on its current value. For the loop to execute one more time, the updated `copya` should not be equal to 0. 
State: **Output State: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with length between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive. The number m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8. `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is updated accordingly by performing integer division by 10 on its current value and the updated `copya` is not equal to 0**
