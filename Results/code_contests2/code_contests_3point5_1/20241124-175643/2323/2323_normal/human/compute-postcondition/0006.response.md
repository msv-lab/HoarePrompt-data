According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is a non-zero value. To execute the loop one more time, `copya` needs to be adjusted to a non-zero value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with length between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive. The number m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8. `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`//10**
