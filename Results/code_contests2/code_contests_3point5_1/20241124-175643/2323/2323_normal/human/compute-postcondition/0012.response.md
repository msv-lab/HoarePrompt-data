According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the only condition mentioned is that the updated `copya` is not equal to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `copya` should be not equal to 0.
State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, and the updated `copya` is not equal to 0**
