The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on predefined inputs, which are Stepan's positive integer and an integer `m` such that 2 <= m <= 10^8. After executing the function body, it returns the remainder when Stepan's integer is divided by `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return the remainder when Stepan's integer is divided by the integer `m`.
