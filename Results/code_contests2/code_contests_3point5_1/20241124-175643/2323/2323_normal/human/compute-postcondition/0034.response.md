Postcondition: ***`copya`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `i` are integers. After the execution of the if-else block, the state of the program variables is as follows: `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10 on its current value, `c` is equal to the number of digits in `a`, `ans` is assigned the minimum value between the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of dividing the updated `a` by `b`, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. In all cases, after the execution of the if-else block, the loop can execute one more time with `i` updated to 1.***
