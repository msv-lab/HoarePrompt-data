The function `func` reads two integer inputs, `a` and `b`, calculates the number of digits in `a`, then iterates through each digit of `a`, performs certain operations, and finally prints the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but relies on user input for `a` and `b`.
