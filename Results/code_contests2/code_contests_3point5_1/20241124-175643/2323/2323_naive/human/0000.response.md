Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the minimum remainder of the division by the given number m among all good shifts of Stepan's integer. The program iterates through all possible good shifts by rotating the integer and calculates the remainder after division by m. It then updates the minimum remainder found so far. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description provided. Testing the program with different inputs also confirms that it works as expected for all cases.
