Example Answer:
The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The value of `c` was 2, so after execution, `c` becomes 3. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is the updated value of `a` which is the integer division of `a` by 10 and `copya` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is the updated value of `a` which is the integer division of `a` by 10 and `copya` is greater than 0**
