According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is the updated value of `a` which is the integer division of `a` by 10 and `copya` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be adjusted to a value that is greater than 0 after integer division by 10.
State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is the updated value of `a` after integer division by 10 and `copya` is greater than 0**
