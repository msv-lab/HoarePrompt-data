Postcondition: ***If copya is greater than 0, a and b remain the same as the input, c is the number of digits in a, copya is the remaining value of a after removing the last digit, ans is the minimum of the current ans and the remainder of the division of the updated a by b. In the if part, a is updated by removing the last digit and adding it as the first digit, and ans is recalculated. In the else part, a is updated based on a specific formula. Regardless of the path taken, the final state ensures that all variables maintain their respective values and relationships within the program.***
