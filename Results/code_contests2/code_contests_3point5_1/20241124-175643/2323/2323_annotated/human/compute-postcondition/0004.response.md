Example Answer:
`copya` is modified by integer division with 10. The value of `copya` is the same as `a`, so after execution, `copya` will be updated accordingly. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is the updated value of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is the updated value of `a`**
