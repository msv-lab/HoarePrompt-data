Example Answer:
The minimum value between the current value of `ans` and the remainder of the division of `a` by `b` is assigned to `ans`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: If copya is greater than 0, a is updated to the result of floor division of a by 10, b remains the same as the input, c is the updated number of digits in a based on the loop index i, copya is the remaining value of a after removing the last digit, ans is the minimum of the current ans and the remainder of the division of the updated a by b, and h is assigned the value of the last digit of a obtained by taking the modulus of a by 10.
