According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is truthy, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is the updated value of `a`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `copya` needs to be truthy. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is the updated value of `a`**
