Example Answer: 
`copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10, so if `a` is 25, then `copya` will be updated to 2. All other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is the updated value of `a` which is the integer division of `a` by 10**
