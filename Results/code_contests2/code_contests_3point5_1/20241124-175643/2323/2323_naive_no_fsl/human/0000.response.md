Correctness: True

The program correctly calculates the minimum remainder of the division by the given number `m` among all good shifts of Stepan's integer. It iterates through all possible cyclic shifts of the integer and calculates the remainder for each shift, keeping track of the minimum remainder found so far. The logic of the program matches the problem description and it handles all cases where the input integer does not have leading zeros.
