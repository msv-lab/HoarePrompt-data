Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string input in the format ns, where n is an integer representing the row index (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in this row from 'a' to 'f'. It then performs calculations based on the extracted values N, C, and M to determine a final result. The function does not return any value.**
