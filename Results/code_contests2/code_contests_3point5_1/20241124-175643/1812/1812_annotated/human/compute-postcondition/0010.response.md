Output State: **`S` is a string obtained from `gets()`, `N` is an integer obtained by excluding the last character of `S`, `C` is the result of the ASCII calculation, `M` is the bitwise AND of `N - 1` and `3`. If `M` is either 1 or 2, then `N` is decreased by either 1 or 2, `M` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with 3, and `N` is increased by `M`. The postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the overall state of the program after the if else block executes. The final output is the result of the expression: `(N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C)`**
