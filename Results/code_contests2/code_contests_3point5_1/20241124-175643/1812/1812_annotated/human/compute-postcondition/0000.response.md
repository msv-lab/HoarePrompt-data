Example Answer:
The lambda function `gets` is defined to read a line from the input and strip any leading or trailing whitespaces. The function `sys.stdin.readline` is used to read input from the standard input. The function is not immediately executed, so no changes occur to the initial state.
Output State: **No changes to the initial state**
