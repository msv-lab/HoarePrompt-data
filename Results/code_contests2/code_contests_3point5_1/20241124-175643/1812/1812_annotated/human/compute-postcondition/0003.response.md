Example Answer:
`C` is assigned the ASCII value of the last character of string `S` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The previous values of `S` and `N` are known, and based on those values, the output state can be calculated.
Output State: **`S` is assigned the input string obtained from `gets()`, `N` is assigned the integer conversion of the string obtained by excluding the last character of `S`, `C` is the result of the ASCII calculation**
