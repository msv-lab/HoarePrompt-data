`S` is assigned the value of the input string obtained from `gets()`. The value of `S` is dependent on the input provided by the user. Therefore, the output state is: No changes to the initial state, `S` is assigned the input string obtained from `gets()`.
Output State: **No changes to the initial state, `S` is assigned the input string obtained from `gets()`**
