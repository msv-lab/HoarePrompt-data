Correctness: **True**

Based on the code and the problem description, it seems like the code is correctly calculating the number of seconds Vasya has to wait before he gets his lunch based on the row number and seat provided. The code adjusts the row number and seat index accordingly and calculates the seat number based on the inputs. It follows the specified rules of how the flight attendants move and serve the passengers.

Additionally, after reviewing the output hints, they align with the code's functionality. The code reads the input, calculates the seat number accurately, and prints the result as expected. The output hints provide a clear explanation of how the code is supposed to work, and the code seems to be following that logic correctly for all potential cases.

Thus, the code is correct in determining the number of seconds Vasya has to wait before getting his lunch for every valid input.
