Example Answer:
`M` is assigned the value of `N - 1` bitwise AND 3. If `N` is a positive integer representing the row number, then `N - 1` will be one less than the row number. Performing a bitwise AND operation with 3 will result in the remainder of dividing `N - 1` by 4. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the row number, `s` is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'); `N` is the extracted row number, `C` is the index of the seat in the row starting from 0, and `M` is the result of (`N - 1`) % 4.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the row number, `s` is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'); `N` is the extracted row number, `C` is the index of the seat in the row starting from 0, and `M` is the result of (`N - 1`) % 4**
