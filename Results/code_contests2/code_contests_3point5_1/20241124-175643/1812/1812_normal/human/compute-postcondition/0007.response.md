Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the row number, `s` is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), `N` is the extracted row number, `C` is the index of the seat in the row starting from 0, and `M` is the result of (`N - 1`) % 4. If `M` is either 1 or 2, then `N` is decreased by `M`. After executing the code, `M` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with 3.**
