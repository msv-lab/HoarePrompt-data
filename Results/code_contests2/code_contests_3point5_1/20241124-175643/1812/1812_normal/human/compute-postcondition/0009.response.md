Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the row number, `s` is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), `N` is the updated row number, `C` is the index of the seat in the row starting from 0, and `M` is the result of (`N - 1`) % 4. If M is in (1, 2), then `N` is modified by subtracting `M`, `M` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with 3, and then `N` is further updated by adding `M`. This ensures that the row number and seat index are adjusted accordingly based on the conditions met.***
