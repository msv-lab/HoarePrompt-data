Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the integer value represented by all characters in `S` except the last one. Given that `S` represents a seat number, `N` will be the row number extracted from the seat number. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the row number, `s` is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'); `N` is the extracted row number from the seat number.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the row number, `s` is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'); `N` is the extracted row number from the seat number**
