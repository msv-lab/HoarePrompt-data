Example Answer:
The variable `S` is assigned the input value obtained from the `gets()` function. The values of `n` and `s` are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the row number, `s` is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), `S` is assigned the input value.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the row number, `s` is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), `S` is assigned the input value**
