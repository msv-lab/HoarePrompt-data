Example Answer:
`N` is increased by `M`, and the value of `M` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with 3. If `M` was either 1 or 2, then `N` was decreased by `M`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the row number, `s` is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), `N` is the updated row number, `C` is the index of the seat in the row starting from 0, and `M` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with 3.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the row number, `s` is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), `N` is the updated row number, `C` is the index of the seat in the row starting from 0, and `M` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with 3**
