Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code simply prints '10' repeated `(n // 2)` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd. However, the problem description requires Sonya to put either a rose or a lily in each position to maximize the total beauty of all segments visited by the visitors. The code does not take into account the specific requirements of the problem description, therefore it is incorrect.
