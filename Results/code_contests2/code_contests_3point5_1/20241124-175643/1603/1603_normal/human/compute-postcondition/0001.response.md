Example Answer:
The code prints '10' repeated (n // 2) times and appends '1' at the end if n is odd. Since n and m are positive integers, the value of n // 2 will be an integer division. Therefore, the output state is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3**
