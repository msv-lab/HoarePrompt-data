Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integer inputs, `n` and `m`, from the user. It then prints a string that consists of '10' repeated `(n // 2)` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it reads input interactively and produces an output based on the input values. The output is a string generated according to the described pattern.**
