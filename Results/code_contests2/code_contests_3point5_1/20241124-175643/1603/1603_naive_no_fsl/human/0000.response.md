Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program simply prints '10' repeated n//2 times and adds '1' if n is odd. This does not take into account the visitors' segments and does not optimize the placement of roses and lilies to maximize the beauty of segments.

For example, in the first sample input (5 3), the optimal placement of roses and lilies should be '01100' to maximize the total beauty to 8. However, the program output '101'. This demonstrates that the program does not work as expected and is incorrect.
