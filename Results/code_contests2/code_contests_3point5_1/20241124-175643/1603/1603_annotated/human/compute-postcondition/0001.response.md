Example Answer: 
The code prints a string composed of '10' repeated n//2 times, followed by '1' if n is an odd number. Since n is between 1 and 1000, the string will consist of '10' repeated a certain number of times and potentially ending with '1'. Therefore, the output state is: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, m is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000, m is an integer between 1 and 1000**
