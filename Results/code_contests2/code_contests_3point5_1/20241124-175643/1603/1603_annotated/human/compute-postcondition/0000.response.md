Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input using `map` and `int`. The values of `n` and `m` are integers within the range of [1, 1000]. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000**
