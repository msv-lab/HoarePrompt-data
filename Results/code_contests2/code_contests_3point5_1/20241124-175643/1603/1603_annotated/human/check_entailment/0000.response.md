Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program only prints '10' repeated n//2 times and appends '1' if n is odd. This approach does not ensure that the sum of beauties of all segments is maximized, which is the requirement of the problem. 

An example where the program fails to provide the correct output:
Input:
5 3
1 3
2 4
2 5

Expected Output:
01100

The expected output ensures the maximum sum of beauties for all segments, which the provided program does not guarantee.
