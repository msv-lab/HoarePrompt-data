To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to determine if the outcome of the game, represented by the final number of coins each player has, can be achieved given that each player initially bet the same positive number of coins `b`. 

### Program Analysis:
```python
c = map(int, raw_input().split())
s = sum(c)
print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads five integers representing the coins each player has at the end.
  
2. **Sum Calculation**: It computes the total number of coins `s` by summing up the input values.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - If the total sum `s` is 0, it outputs `-1`. This is correct because if all players have 0 coins, it implies that they could not have made any initial positive bets.
   - If `s` is not zero but is not divisible by 5 (the number of players), it also outputs `-1`. This is correct because if `s` is not divisible by the number of players, it is impossible to have an equal initial bet `b`.

4. **Final Bet Calculation**: If the above conditions are not met, it calculates the initial bet `b` as `s / 5`. Since the input constraints specify that `b` must be a positive integer, the program does not check for `b <= 0` explicitly, which could lead to incorrect results.

### Potential Case Analysis:
The code assumes that if `s` is divisible by 5, the result will be a valid positive integer for `b`. However, we can have a scenario where the sum is divisible by 5 but results in a non-positive integer:

- **Test Case**: If all players have 0 coins:
  - Input: `0 0 0 0 0`
  - Expected Output: `-1` (since no positive initial bet can exist)
  - Actual Output: `s = 0`, hence it correctly outputs `-1`.

- **Test Case**: If one player has 5 coins and the others have 0:
  - Input: `5 0 0 0 0`
  - Expected Output: `1` (since each player initially bet 1 coin)
  - Actual Output: `s = 5`, which is divisible by 5, so it outputs `1`.

- **Test Case**: If the total coins sum to a multiple of 5 but results in a non-positive bet:
  - Input: `10 0 0 0 0`
  - Expected Output: `2` (since each player initially bet 2 coins)
  - Actual Output: `s = 10`, which is divisible by 5, so it outputs `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program handles the cases well except for not explicitly checking if the resulting bet `b` is positive after division. However, as per the problem description and our tests, it does produce correct outputs for the described scenarios.

Final assessment:
Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly determines the initial bet size or identifies when it is impossible to achieve the outcome based on the final coin distribution among players.
