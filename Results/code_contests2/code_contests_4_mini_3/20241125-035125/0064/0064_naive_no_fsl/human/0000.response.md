To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the context of the requirements.

The problem states that there are five players, each starting with an initial bet of `b` coins. After playing, each player has a certain number of coins `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5`. The task is to find the initial bet `b` or determine that such a bet cannot yield the final coin amounts.

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. `c = map(int, raw_input().split())`: This line reads five integers representing the final number of coins each player has.
2. `s = sum(c)`: This calculates the total number of coins all players have at the end of the game.
3. `print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)`: 
   - If the total `s` is zero, it prints -1, indicating no positive initial bet could result in this outcome (since all players would need to start with at least some coins).
   - If `s` is not divisible by the number of players (which is 5), it also returns -1, as you cannot evenly distribute bets among players.
   - Otherwise, it calculates and prints `s / len(c)` which gives the initial bet `b`.

### Analyzing Edge Cases:
1. **All players have 0 coins**: 
   - Input: `0 0 0 0 0`
   - Expected Output: `-1` (correctly handled, as `s` is 0).
   
2. **Some players have coins, but total is not divisible by 5**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 1 2`
   - Total: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6`, which is not divisible by 5.
   - Expected Output: `-1` (correctly handled).

3. **Total is divisible by 5, but not all players have the same initial amount**:
   - Input: `2 5 4 0 4`
   - Total: `2 + 5 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 15`, which is divisible by 5.
   - Expected Output: `15 / 5 = 3` (correctly handled).

4. **Total is 0 but players have non-zero coins**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 1 1` gives `5`, which is divisible by 5, but since each player should have started with a non-zero bet, it should result in `-1`.

5. **Valid case where all players have the same number of coins**:
   - Input: `5 5 5 5 5`
   - Total: `25`, which is divisible by 5, thus should yield `5`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies cases where the total coins are zero or not divisible by the number of players and provides the correct initial bet when applicable. However, the case where players have non-zero coins but the total is zero (which contradicts the requirement of each player having a positive starting amount) is not directly addressed.

As such, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when players have a positive number of coins but the game outcome is impossible under the rules.

Correctness: **False**
