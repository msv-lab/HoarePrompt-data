You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: There are five people playing a game called "Generosity". Each person gives some non-zero number of coins b as an initial bet. After all players make their bets of b coins, the following operation is repeated for several times: a coin is passed from one player to some other player.

Your task is to write a program that can, given the number of coins each player has at the end of the game, determine the size b of the initial bet or find out that such outcome of the game cannot be obtained for any positive number of coins b in the initial bet.

Input

The input consists of a single line containing five integers c1, c2, c3, c4 and c5 — the number of coins that the first, second, third, fourth and fifth players respectively have at the end of the game (0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100).

Output

Print the only line containing a single positive integer b — the number of coins in the initial bet of each player. If there is no such value of b, then print the only value "-1" (quotes for clarity).

Examples

Input

2 5 4 0 4


Output

3


Input

4 5 9 2 1


Output

-1

Note

In the first sample the following sequence of operations is possible:

  1. One coin is passed from the fourth player to the second player; 
  2. One coin is passed from the fourth player to the fifth player; 
  3. One coin is passed from the first player to the third player; 
  4. One coin is passed from the fourth player to the second player. 
Program:
```

def func():
    c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    s = sum(c)
    print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```
