To analyze the provided code:

1. The variable `c` is a list of integers representing the current state of coins for the players.
2. The code computes the sum of the integers in the list `c` and assigns this value to the variable `s`.
3. The previous values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are not directly affected by this operation, but `s` will depend on the values present in the list `c`.

The output state will reflect the computation of the sum and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are non-negative integers; `s` is the sum of the integers in the list `c`.**
