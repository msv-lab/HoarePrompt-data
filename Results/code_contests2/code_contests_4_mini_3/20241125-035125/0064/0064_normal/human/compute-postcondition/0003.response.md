The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes five non-negative integers representing the number of coins each player has at the end of the game. Each integer must satisfy the constraint 0 ≤ ci ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The function's output is not specified, so it remains unclear what the function returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to handle five non-negative integers representing coin counts for players within the specified range, but the return value is not determined based on the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and handles five non-negative integers representing the number of coins each player has, constrained between 0 and 100. The return value is not specified.**
