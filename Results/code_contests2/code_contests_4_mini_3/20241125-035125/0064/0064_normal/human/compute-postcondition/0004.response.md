Functionality: ** The function reads a line of input consisting of five non-negative integers (representing the number of coins each player has), calculates their sum, and checks if the sum is zero or if it is not divisible by the number of integers provided. If the sum is zero or not divisible, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the average number of coins per player (sum divided by the number of integers). Note that the function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value but prints the result directly. **
