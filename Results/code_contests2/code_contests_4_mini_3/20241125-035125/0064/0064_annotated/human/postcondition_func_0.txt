The function reads a line of input, splits it into integers representing the number of coins each player has, and calculates the sum of these integers. It then checks if the sum is zero or if the sum is not divisible by the number of players (the count of integers). If either condition is true, the function prints -1; otherwise, it prints the average number of coins per player (sum divided by the number of players). Note that there is no explicit handling of the case where no input is given, which could lead to a runtime error.
