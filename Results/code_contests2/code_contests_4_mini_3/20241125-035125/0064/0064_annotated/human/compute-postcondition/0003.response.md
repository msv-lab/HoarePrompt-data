The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes five integers representing the number of coins each of the five players has at the end of the game, where each integer `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` is constrained to the range of 0 to 100 (inclusive). The function evaluates these coin counts and produces output based on specific conditions regarding the values of the coins.

Since the output behavior is not defined in the provided information, we cannot specify the exact return values. However, based on the structure, it is likely that the function will handle scenarios related to the players' coins.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes five integers for the number of coins each player has, returning values based on conditions related to these coin counts.**
