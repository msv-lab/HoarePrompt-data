To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state. 

1. The initial state indicates that `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are integers representing the number of coins each of the five players has. The variable `s` is defined as the sum of these integers: `s = c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5`.

2. The code snippet checks two conditions using `s`: 
   - If `s == 0`, it will print `-1`.
   - If `s % len(c) != 0`, it will also print `-1`. Since `len(c)` is 5 (the number of players), this condition checks if `s` is not divisible by 5.
   - If neither of the above conditions holds, it will print `s / len(c)`.

Now, let's consider the possible states of `s` based on the values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`.

Output State: **`s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`; print -1 if `s` is 0 or if `s` is not divisible by 5, otherwise print `s / 5`**.
