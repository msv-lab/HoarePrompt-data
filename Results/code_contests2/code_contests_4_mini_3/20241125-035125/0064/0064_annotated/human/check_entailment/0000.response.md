To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze both the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description
The program is supposed to read five integers, which represent the number of coins each of the five players has at the end of the game. It then needs to calculate the initial bet size \( b \) such that:
1. Each player started with \( b \) coins.
2. The total number of coins after all transfers should still equal \( 5b \).

### Code Analysis
Here’s the annotated code:
```python
def func():
    c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    s = sum(c)
    print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

1. **Input Handling**: It reads a line of input and splits it into five integers.
2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum \( s \) of the coins each player has after the game.
3. **Output Logic**:
   - If \( s \) is 0, it prints `-1` (which is correct since a zero sum implies no initial bets).
   - If \( s \) is not divisible by 5 (`len(c)`), it also prints `-1`. This checks if the total sum can evenly distribute among the five players.
   - If both checks pass, it computes and prints \( s / 5 \), which should yield the initial bet \( b \).

### Potential Issues
Let’s evaluate if there are any potential cases where the program does not behave as expected:

1. **Valid Input - Non-Zero Case**: If the players have coins such that their total sum \( s \) is divisible by 5 and greater than zero, the program should correctly return \( b \).
2. **Valid Input - Edge Case with Zeros**: If all players end with 0 coins, it correctly returns `-1`.
3. **Valid Input - Sum Not Divisible by 5**: If the sum is not divisible by 5, it correctly returns `-1`.
4. **Valid Input - Sum is Zero**: This is correctly handled by returning `-1`.

### Important Consideration
The code does not explicitly check if all players had a positive initial bet, but since the problem states that they must have a positive number of coins initially, the output of `-1` in cases where the sum is zero or not divisible by 5 should generally cover the requirements. 

However, consider this case: 
- Input: `1 2 2 3 3` (Total = 11). The program would return `-1`, which is correct since \( 11 \mod 5 \neq 0 \).
- Input: `1 1 1 1 1` (Total = 5). The program would return `1`, which is valid.
- Input: `0 0 0 0 0` (Total = 0). The program would return `-1`, which is correct.

### Conclusion
After going through the logic and potential edge cases carefully, we can conclude that the program correctly handles the problem description and all specified cases. 

Correctness: **True**
