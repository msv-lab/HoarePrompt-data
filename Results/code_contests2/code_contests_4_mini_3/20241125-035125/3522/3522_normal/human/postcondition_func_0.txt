The function accepts an integer input representing the number of queries, processes each query as a positive integer, and for each integer `a`, it checks if `a` is odd. If `a` is odd, it decreases `a` by 9 and sets a counter `c` to 1. If `a` is even, `c` remains 0. It then returns -1 if `a` is one of the integers in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}; otherwise, it calculates and returns the value of `a / 4 + c`. If the initial input is 0, no queries are processed, and the function does not output any results.
