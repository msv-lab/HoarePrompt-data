The value of `a` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a user input as a string. The previous value of `q` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), and `a` is an input string.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), and `a` is an input string**
