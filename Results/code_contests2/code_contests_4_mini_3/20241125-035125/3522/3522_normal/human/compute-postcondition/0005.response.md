The value of `c` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `c` was `0`, but the states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), `a` is an updated odd integer (original value minus 9), `c` is 1. 

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), `a` is an updated odd integer (original value minus 9), `c` is 1**
