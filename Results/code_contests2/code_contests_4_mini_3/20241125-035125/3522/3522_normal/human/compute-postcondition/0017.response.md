The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`, which indicates that `a` is now considered even regardless of its previous state. The previous state of `c` was determined by the parity of `a`, but it is now explicitly set to `0`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is either odd or even; `c` is now 0.

Output State: **`a` is either odd or even; `c` is 0**
