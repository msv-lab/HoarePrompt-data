The code checks if `a` is in the specific set of integers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it prints -1. If not, it calculates `a / 4 + c`. The variable `c` is determined by the parity of `a`: if `a` is odd, `c` will be 1 after `a` is decreased by 9; if `a` is even, `c` remains 0. 

Since the precise value of `a` is not provided, we cannot conclusively determine the output without knowing whether `a` is odd or even and whether it is in the specified set. Therefore, the output state is generalized based on the conditions.

Output State: **`a` is an integer; if `a` is odd, it is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1; if `a` is even, `c` remains 0; the output is -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else `a / 4 + c`.**
