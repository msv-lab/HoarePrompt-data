The code checks if `a` is in the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`. If `a` is in this set, it will print `-1`. If `a` is not in this set, it will compute `a / 4 + c`. The value of `c` depends on whether `a` is odd or even, affecting the output.

1. If `a` is odd (values could be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 11), `c` is set to 1 and `a` is decreased by 9. Then, the possible values for `a` could be negative or less than the original odd value. The result will be `-1` if `a` is one of the odd numbers in the tuple, otherwise it will be calculated as `a / 4 + 1`.
  
2. If `a` is even (values could be 2), `c` remains 0. If `a` equals 2, it will print `-1`. If `a` is another even number that is not in the tuple, it will compute `a / 4 + 0`.

Therefore, the Output State considers all possible values of `a` (odd or even) and their impact on `c`:

Output State: **`a` is either odd or even; if odd, `c` is 1; if even, `c` is 0; and the output will either be -1 or a calculation involving `a / 4 + c`.**
