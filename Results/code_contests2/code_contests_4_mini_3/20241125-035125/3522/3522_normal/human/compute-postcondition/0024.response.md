The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters since it has an empty parameter list. However, it processes a number of queries represented by a positive integer `q`, which indicates the number of individual queries. For each query, a positive integer `ni` is considered. The function will return results based on the processing of these queries.

The functionality of the function `func` is to handle `q` queries, where each query consists of a positive integer `ni`. The output will depend on the specific logic applied to these queries, which is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the function is designed to process multiple queries (up to 100,000) and return results based on the conditions applied to each positive integer query.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer q representing the number of queries, and processes each query ni, which is a positive integer. The exact return values depend on the specific logic applied to each query.**
