Output State: **`a` is a positive integer; if `a` is odd, it is decreased by 9 and `c` becomes 1; if `a` is even, `c` remains 0. The output will be -1 if `a` is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}; otherwise, it will be `a / 4 + c`. If `q` is zero, the loop does not execute, and `a` and `c` are not defined.**
