The variable `a` is assigned the value `a - 9`. Since `a` can either be odd or even, subtracting 9 from it will result in a value that is either even or odd, depending on the initial value of `a`. Specifically, if `a` is odd, `a - 9` will be even, and if `a` is even, `a - 9` will be odd. The variable `c` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is either odd or even; `c` is 0, and `a` is updated to `a - 9`.

Output State: **`a` is either odd or even; `c` is 0, and `a` is updated to `a - 9**
