The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state of `c` was either `0` or `1` based on the parity of `a`, but since `c` is explicitly set to `0`, it is now `0`. The state of `a` remains unchanged and is still either odd or even. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is either odd or even; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is either odd or even; `c` is 0**
