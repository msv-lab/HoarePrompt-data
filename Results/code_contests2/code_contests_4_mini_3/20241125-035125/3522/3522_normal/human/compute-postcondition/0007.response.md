To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the variables based on the initial state. The variable `a` can either be odd or even, and `c` is derived from this condition.

1. If `a` is an odd integer, it gets updated to `a - 9`, and `c` is set to 1.
2. If `a` is an even integer, `a` remains unchanged, and `c` remains 0.

The `print` statement checks if `a` is in the set `{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}`.
- If `a` is found in that set, it will print `-1`.
- If `a` is not in the set, it will print the value of `a / 4 + c`.

The output depends on the parity of `a` and its value relative to the specified set.

- If `a` is odd and in the set, the output is `-1`.
- If `a` is odd and not in the set, the output is `(a - 9) / 4 + 1`.
- If `a` is even and in the set, the output is `-1`.
- If `a` is even and not in the set, the output is `a / 4`.

Since the exact values of `a` and the state of `q` are not provided, we cannot specify exact numeric outputs, but we can outline the possible outcomes based on conditions.

Output State: **`a` is either odd or even; `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the parity of `a`; the output will depend on whether `a` is in the set `{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}` or not.**
