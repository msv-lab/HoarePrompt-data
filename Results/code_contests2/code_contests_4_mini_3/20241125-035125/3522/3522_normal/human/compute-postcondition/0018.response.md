The value of `a` is decremented by 9. Since `a` can be either odd or even, the new value of `a` will be either odd or even depending on its initial state. If `a` is odd, the result will be even; if `a` is even, the result will be odd. The value of `c` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is either odd or even; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is either odd or even; `c` is 0**
