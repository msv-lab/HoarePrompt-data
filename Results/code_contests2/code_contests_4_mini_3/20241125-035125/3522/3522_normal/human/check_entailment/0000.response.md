To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description, the code, and the output hints.

**Problem Description**:
The task is to represent a given integer \( n_i \) as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands. If this is not possible, we should return -1. Composite numbers are defined as integers greater than 1 that are not prime.

**Code**:
```python
for _ in xrange(input()):
    a = input()
    c = 0
    if a % 2 != 0:
        a = a - 9
        c = 1
    print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

**Analysis of Code**:
1. The code processes multiple queries, as indicated by the first input.
2. For each query, it checks if the number \( a \) is odd. If it is, it subtracts 9 from \( a \) and sets \( c \) to 1.
3. It then checks if the modified \( a \) is one of the numbers in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}. If so, it prints -1.
4. If \( a \) is not in that set, it computes \( a / 4 + c \).

**Potential Edge Cases**:
- **Odd values of \( a \)**: The code handles odd values by subtracting 9. If \( a \) is less than 9 (1, 2, 3, 5, 7), it will lead to a negative or invalid value. This is already handled by checking against the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11} to return -1.
- **Even values of \( a \)**: The program does not explicitly handle even values less than 4 that cannot be expressed as sums of composite numbers. For example, if \( a = 2 \) or \( a = 4 \) (both even), the code would output -1 for 2 and correctly compute for 4 as \( 4 / 4 + 0 = 1 \). However, it does not consider if 4 can be split into composite numbers (it cannot; it can only be represented as 4 itself).
- **Dividing by 4**: For even numbers greater than 4, the calculation \( a / 4 \) is valid. However, it assumes that any even number greater than 4 can be split into composite summands, which is not always true. For example, \( a = 6 \) can only be represented as 4 + 2, and 2 is not composite.

**Output Hints**:
The output hints explain that the function checks if \( a \) is odd and modifies it accordingly. They also state that it will output -1 if \( a \) is in the specific set of numbers. However, the hints do not mention the issue with even numbers (like 6). 

**Conclusion**:
The program fails to handle all cases as described in the problem statement. For example, when \( a = 6 \), it outputs 1, which is incorrect since 6 cannot be split into composite summands. Similarly, it does not handle other edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle cases like \( n_i = 6 \), which cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers but returns 1 instead.
