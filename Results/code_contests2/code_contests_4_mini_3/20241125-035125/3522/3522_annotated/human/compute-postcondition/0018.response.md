`a` is updated by subtracting 9 from its previous value. The variable `c` remains unchanged at 0, and `q` is still greater than 0. The specific new value of `a` depends on its initial input value. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is greater than 0, `a` is the input value minus 9, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `a` is the input value minus 9, `c` is 0**
