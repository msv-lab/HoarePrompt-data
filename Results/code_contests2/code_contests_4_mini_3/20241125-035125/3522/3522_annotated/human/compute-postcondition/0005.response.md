The variable `c` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `q` and `a` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input odd number decreased by 9, and `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input odd number decreased by 9, `c` is 1**
