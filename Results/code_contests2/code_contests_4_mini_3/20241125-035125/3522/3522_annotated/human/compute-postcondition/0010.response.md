The value of `c` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `c` can either be `0` or `1` depending on the parity of `a`, but it is being explicitly set to `0`. The values of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input value, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input value, and `c` is 0**
