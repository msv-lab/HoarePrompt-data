To determine the output state, we analyze the given initial conditions and the provided code snippet.

- The initial state indicates that `q` is greater than 0 and `a` is an input value.
- Depending on whether `a` is odd or even, `a` may be modified, and `c` may be set to 1 or remain 0:
  - If `a` is odd: 
    - `a` is decreased by 9.
    - `c` is set to 1.
  - If `a` is even: 
    - `a` remains unchanged.
    - `c` remains 0.

Now, we analyze the print statement:
```
print -1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```
- If `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the output will be `-1`.
- If `a` is not in that set, the output will be calculated as `a / 4 + c`.

Given that `a` is an input value, the specific result of the print statement cannot be determined without knowing the exact value of `a`. However, we can describe the potential outcomes based on the conditions:

1. If `a` is odd and after decrementing by 9, if the result (new `a`) is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the output will be `-1`. If not, the output will be `new a / 4 + 1`.
2. If `a` is even and not in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the output will be `a / 4 + 0`, which simplifies to `a / 4`.

Since we cannot specify the exact output without the input value of `a`, we conclude with a general output state.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input value; `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the parity of `a`; print output is either -1 or calculated as a / 4 + c.**
