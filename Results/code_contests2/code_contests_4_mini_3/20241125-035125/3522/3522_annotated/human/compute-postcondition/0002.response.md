The variable `c` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of the affected variables (`q` and `a`) remain unchanged, but `c` now has a value of 0. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input value, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input value, and `c` is 0**
