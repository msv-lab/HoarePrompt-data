The value of `c` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `c` was `0`, but it is now updated. The values of `q` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input value decreased by 9, `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input value decreased by 9, `c` is 1**
