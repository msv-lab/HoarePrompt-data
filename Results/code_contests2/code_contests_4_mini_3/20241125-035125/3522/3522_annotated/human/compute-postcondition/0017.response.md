The code assigns the value `0` to `c`. The previous value of `c` could be either `0` or `1`, but it will be updated to `0`. The states of the other variables, `q` and `a`, are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input value, `c` is now 0.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input value, `c` is now 0**
