The value of `a` is decremented by 9. Since `a` is an odd number, subtracting 9 from it will yield another even number (because odd - odd = even). The value of `c` remains unchanged at 0, and `q` is still greater than 0. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input odd number decreased by 9, `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input odd number decreased by 9, `c` is 0**
