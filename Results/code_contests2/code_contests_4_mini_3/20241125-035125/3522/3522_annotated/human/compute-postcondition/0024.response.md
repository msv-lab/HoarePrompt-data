The function `func` accepts a parameter `q`, which is a positive integer representing the number of queries. Each query consists of a positive integer `ni`, where `1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9`, for which the maximum number of composite summands is to be determined. After executing the function, it returns the maximum number of composite summands for each query in a list format. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `q` and a list of positive integers `ni`, and return the maximum number of composite summands for each `ni`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer q and a list of positive integers ni, returning the maximum number of composite summands for each ni.**
