The code checks if `a` is in the specified tuple (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it prints -1; otherwise, it calculates `a / 4 + c`. The variable `c` will either be 0 or 1 based on whether `a` is odd or even, but `c`'s value does not affect the outcome if `a` is included in the tuple. 

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we will consider both possibilities based on whether `a` is odd or even:

- If `a` is odd and in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11): The output will be -1.
- If `a` is even and in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11): The output will also be -1.
- If `a` is not in the tuple: 
  - If `a` is odd: `a` is decreased by 9, and `c` is set to 1. The result will be `(a - 9) / 4 + 1`.
  - If `a` is even: `c` remains 0, and the result will be `a / 4 + 0`, which is `a / 4`.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0; if `a` is odd, then `a` is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1; if `a` is even, then `a` remains unchanged and `c` remains 0; the output is either -1 or depends on the value of `a`.**
