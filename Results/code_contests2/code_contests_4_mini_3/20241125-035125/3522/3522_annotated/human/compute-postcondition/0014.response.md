To analyze the provided code snippet:

1. The variable `a` can be either odd or even based on the initial input, which affects its value as well as the value of `c`.
2. If `a` is odd, it will be decreased by 9, and `c` will be set to 1.
3. If `a` is even, it remains unchanged, and `c` remains 0.
4. The output will be determined by checking if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, the output will be -1; otherwise, it will calculate `a / 4 + c`.

Since we don't have specific values for `a`, the output state depends on whether `a` is odd or even and what the final value of `a` and `c` will be. 

Assuming `a` is initially odd:
- If `a` is odd (let's say 11), then `a` would be decreased by 9 (resulting in 2), and `c` would be set to 1. The check will yield -1 because 2 is in the set.

Assuming `a` is initially even:
- If `a` is even (let's say 2), `a` remains 2, and `c` remains 0. The check will yield -1 because 2 is in the set.

Thus, regardless of whether `a` is odd or even, if `a` is from the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the output will be -1.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input value, `c` is either 0 or 1, and the output is -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)**.
