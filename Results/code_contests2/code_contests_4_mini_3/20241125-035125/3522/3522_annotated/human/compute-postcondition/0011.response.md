The variable `a` is updated by subtracting 9 from its previous value. Since `a` is an input value, its specific value is unknown, but it will be decreased by 9. The values of `q` and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a`.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `a` is an input value decreased by 9, `c` is 0**
