`c` is assigned the value `1`, changing its previous value from `0` to `1`. The other variables, `q` and `a`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is greater than 0, `a` is the input value minus 9, `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `a` is the input value minus 9, `c` is 1**
