According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided to the loop. The loop will run for the number of queries `q`, which is a positive integer. For the loop to execute, `q` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is used as the loop variable and does not need to be initialized since it is not used inside the loop body.

State: **`q` is greater than 0**
