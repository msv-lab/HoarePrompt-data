The function accepts a positive integer input representing the number of queries, followed by a list of positive integers. For each integer, it checks if the integer is odd, subtracts 9 if it is, and calculates the output based on whether the adjusted integer is in the set of small prime numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If the adjusted integer is one of these primes, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the integer divided by 4 plus 1 if it was odd or just the integer divided by 4 if it was even. Additionally, if the integer is less than 9 and odd, the function will always return -1 after adjustment.
