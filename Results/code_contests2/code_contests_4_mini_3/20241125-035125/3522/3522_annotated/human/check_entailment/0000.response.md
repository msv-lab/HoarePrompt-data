To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code.

The program is supposed to take several queries where each query consists of a single positive integer `ni`. The goal is to represent `ni` as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands and print that maximum number, or print -1 if there are no such splittings.

### Analyzing the Code

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of queries `q` and then iteratively reads each integer `a` for the queries.

2. **Logic for Composite Summands**:
   - The program checks if `a` is odd. If it is odd, it subtracts 9 from `a` and sets `c` to 1 (indicating that one composite summand has been accounted for).
   - It checks if `a` is one of the small numbers that cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers, specifically: `1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11`.
   - If `a` is among these numbers, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the possible number of composite summands as `a // 4 + c`.

3. **Composite Numbers**:
   - The program effectively uses the fact that the smallest composite number is `4`, and thus the maximum number of `4`s that can sum to `a` is `a // 4`. 

### Potential Edge Cases

Now, let's identify potential cases where the program may not work as expected:

- The program does not handle the case where `a` is an odd number less than `9` properly. For instance:
  - If `a = 1`, it will output `-1` which is correct.
  - If `a = 3`, it will output `-1` which is also correct.
  - However, for `a = 5`, it will output `-1`, which is correct.
  - If `a = 9`, since it is odd, it will be adjusted to `0` (9 - 9) and then when checked against the forbidden numbers, it will not match any, leading to a calculated result of `0 // 4 + 1 = 1`, which is incorrect since there are no valid composite summands for `9`.

### Conclusion

The program fails to correctly identify the case for `9` and consequently gives an incorrect output. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
