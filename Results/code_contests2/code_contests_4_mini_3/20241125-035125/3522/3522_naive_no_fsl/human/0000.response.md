To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to carefully analyze the logic of the code and see if it handles all potential cases correctly.

### Analyzing the Code

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of queries and then processes each integer `ni` in a loop.

2. **Processing Each Query**:
   - If `ni` is odd, it subtracts 9 from `ni` and increments `c` by 1.
   - Then, it checks if the modified `ni` (or original if even) is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}.
   - If it is in that set, it outputs -1, indicating no valid splitting into composite numbers is possible.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of composite summands by dividing `ni` by 4 and adding `c`.

### Key Points about Composite Numbers
- The smallest composite number is 4. So any number less than 4 cannot be represented as a sum of composite numbers.
- The program also needs to properly handle edge cases such as:
  - Numbers like 1, 2, 3 which should return -1.
  - Even numbers that can be split into composite parts.

### Testing Potential Cases

1. **Test Case: `ni = 12`**
   - 12 is even and greater than 4.
   - The output should be `12 / 4 = 3`.
   - **Expected Output: 3**. **Correct**.

2. **Test Case: `ni = 6`**
   - 6 is even and can be expressed as `4 + 4`.
   - The output should be `6 / 4 = 1`.
   - **Expected Output: 1**. **Correct**.

3. **Test Case: `ni = 8`**
   - 8 can be expressed as `4 + 4`.
   - The output should be `8 / 4 = 2`.
   - **Expected Output: 2**. **Correct**.

4. **Test Case: `ni = 1`**
   - 1 cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers.
   - The output should be -1.
   - **Expected Output: -1**. **Correct**.

5. **Test Case: `ni = 2`**
   - Same reasoning as above; cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers.
   - The output should be -1.
   - **Expected Output: -1**. **Correct**.

6. **Test Case: `ni = 3`**
   - Same as above; cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers.
   - The output should be -1.
   - **Expected Output: -1**. **Correct**.

7. **Test Case: `ni = 5`**
   - 5 is also not composite and cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers.
   - The output should be -1.
   - **Expected Output: -1**. **Correct**.

8. **Test Case: `ni = 7`**
   - Similar to 5; cannot be expressed.
   - The output should be -1.
   - **Expected Output: -1**. **Correct**.

9. **Test Case: `ni = 11`**
   - Same reasoning; cannot be expressed.
   - The output should be -1.
   - **Expected Output: -1**. **Correct**.

10. **Test Case: `ni = 13`**
    - 13 is odd, it will subtract 9, resulting in 4.
    - 4 can be expressed as a sum of itself.
    - The output should be `4 / 4 + 1 = 2`.
    - **Expected Output: 2**. **Correct**.

### Conclusion
In all tested cases, the outputs match the expected results according to the problem description. The program correctly identifies numbers that cannot be expressed as sums of composite numbers and calculates the maximum number of composite summands for valid cases.

### Final Verdict
Correctness: **True**
