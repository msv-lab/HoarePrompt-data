The function `func_1` accepts a string `n` and processes it to check if it is a palindrome. It does so by converting all alphabetic characters in the string to lowercase and discarding any non-alphabetic characters. The function then compares the processed string to its reverse. 

The annotations incorrectly state that the function accepts a positive integer, which is not true; it actually accepts a string. The function will return `True` if the processed string is empty (which will always be true), or if the characters form a palindrome after filtering. If the processed string is not a palindrome, it will return `False`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `n`, filters out non-alphabetic characters, converts the remaining characters to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise. **
