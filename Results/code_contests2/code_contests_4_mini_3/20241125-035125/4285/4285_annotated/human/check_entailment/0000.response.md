Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function that returns the n-th even-length positive palindrome number. However, the program instead checks if a given input string (expected to be a number) is a palindrome, which is not relevant to the task at hand.

For example, if the input is `1`, the expected output should be `11`, but the program does not compute or return this value. Instead, it processes the string and attempts to determine if it is a palindrome, which is irrelevant to the problem description.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements outlined, and it fails to handle the input correctly for any case.
