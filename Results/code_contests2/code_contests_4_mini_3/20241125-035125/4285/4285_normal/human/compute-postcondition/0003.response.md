The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be a string (not a positive integer as stated in the annotations). It processes the string by filtering out non-alphabetic characters, converting the remaining characters to lowercase, and then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards). The function returns `True` if the cleaned string is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If `n` is an empty string or contains no alphabetic characters, the function will return `True` since an empty string is considered a palindrome.
- The function does not handle cases where `n` may not be a string type, leading to potential errors if non-string inputs are provided.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `n`, removes non-alphabetic characters, converts it to lowercase, and returns `True` if the resulting string is a palindrome, or `False` otherwise. It may not handle non-string inputs properly. **
