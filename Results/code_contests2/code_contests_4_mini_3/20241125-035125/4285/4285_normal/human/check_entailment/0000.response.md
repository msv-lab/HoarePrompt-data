The provided problem description asks for a program that finds the n-th even-length positive palindrome number. An even-length palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards and has an even number of digits (e.g., 11, 1001). 

The given code, however, does not address this problem at all. Instead, it defines a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome after removing non-alphabetic characters and converting it to lowercase. This is entirely unrelated to identifying even-length palindromes or finding the n-th even-length palindrome.

The output hints also describe functionality that is completely different from the task at hand. They detail how to determine if a string is a palindrome, rather than addressing how to compute even-length palindromes based on an integer input.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in any capacity, and thus it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program is incorrect because it does not compute the n-th even-length positive palindrome number and instead checks for palindromes in a string, which is outside the problem's scope.
