Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` is intended to determine the n-th even-length palindrome number, but instead, it processes a string input `n` to check if it is a palindrome. This is not aligned with the task of generating and returning the n-th even-length palindrome number.

For example, if the input is `1`, the expected output is `11`, but the function would not be able to return this value because it does not implement the logic to generate even-length palindromes. Instead, it attempts to filter out alphabetic characters from `n` and check for palindrome properties, which is irrelevant to the problem.

Additionally, there is no handling of the input size constraint (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000`), nor does the function accommodate large integers as required by the problem description. Thus, the function is fundamentally incorrect based on the requirements provided.
