Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` is supposed to compute the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, but instead, it appears to check if a given string `n` is a palindrome by filtering out alphabetic characters and comparing the resulting string to its reverse.

Here are the issues with the program:
1. The program does not take an integer input `n` and compute the n-th even-length palindrome. Instead, it processes `n` as a string and checks if it's a palindrome.
2. There is no logic in the program to generate or return even-length palindromes, which is the main requirement of the task.
3. For example, if `n = 1`, the expected output is `11`, but the program will not produce any output related to that since it does not implement the necessary logic to find even-length palindromes.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem's requirements, making it incorrect.
