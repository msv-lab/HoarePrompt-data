The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, it takes a new value of `n - 1`. The value of `j` is previously set to `n - 1`, and after the update of `n`, `j` will now equal `n - 1 - 1`, which is `n - 2`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `n` and `j`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is n - 2**
