According to the code, the loop executes as long as `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `n` is greater than 0, so for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain greater than 0. The variable `j` is currently `n - 2`, which means it is less than or equal to -2, but this does not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is n - 2**
