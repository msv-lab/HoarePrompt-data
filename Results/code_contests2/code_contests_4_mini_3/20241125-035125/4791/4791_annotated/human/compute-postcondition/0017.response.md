The code snippet calculates the position of the least significant bit that is set to 1 in the binary representation of `j + 1`. 

Given that `j` is 2, we first compute `j + 1`, which equals 3. The binary representation of 3 is `11`. When we reverse this string, we get `11`. The `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is 0. We then add 1 to this index, resulting in 1.

The function prints the value `1`, but the output state remains unchanged for `n` and `j`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the function prints 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the function prints 1**
