According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `n`. For the loop to continue executing, the value of `j` needs to be less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. This means `n` can be 3 or more for the loop to execute again. Therefore, to allow for one more iteration, `n` must be at least 3, and `j` would be incremented to 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3, and the function prints 1**
