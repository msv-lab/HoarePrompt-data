According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is a valid integer greater than 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Since `n` is greater than 0 and is a valid integer, it will still be greater than `j` after this increment.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `j` has been incremented by 1. There are no other states that need to be adjusted.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 1**
