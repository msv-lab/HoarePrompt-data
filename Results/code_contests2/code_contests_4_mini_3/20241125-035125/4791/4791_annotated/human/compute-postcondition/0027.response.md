The code prints the result of the expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. 

1. `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than 0, so `j + 1` is greater than 1.
2. The `bin()` function converts `j + 1` to its binary representation as a string.
3. `[::-1]` reverses the binary string.
4. `find('1')` finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. Since `j + 1` is greater than 1, the binary representation will start with '1', and the index of the first '1' will be 0.
5. Adding 1 to the index gives us 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be 1, as it will print `0 + 1`.

The output state is:
`n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n`, and the print statement outputs 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n`, and the print statement outputs 1**
