According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the integer `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Since `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, we need to ensure that `j` can be incremented to 2 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted since `N` and the result of the print statement do not influence the loop's execution condition.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `j` is 2, and the result of the print statement is 2**.
