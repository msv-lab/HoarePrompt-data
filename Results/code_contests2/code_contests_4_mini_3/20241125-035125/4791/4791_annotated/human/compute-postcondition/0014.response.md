According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged since it is still greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
