Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute n times, and the printed outputs will correspond to the positions of the least significant '1' bits in the binary representations of integers from 1 to n. After the loop, `n` remains greater than 0, and `j` will be n-1 (the last index of the loop). If n is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `n` remains unchanged while `j` is not defined.**
