Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an input value `n`. It decrements `n` in a loop until it reaches 0. For each value of `n`, it prints the positions of the least significant '1' bits for integers from 1 up to the current value of `n`. If `n` is initially 0 or negative, the function does not execute the loop and produces no output. The function does not return any value. **
