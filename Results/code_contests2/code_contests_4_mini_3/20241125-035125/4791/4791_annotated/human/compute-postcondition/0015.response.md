The code calculates the position of the least significant '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`. The binary representation of `2` is `10`. Reversing this gives `01`. The position of the first '1' in this reversed string is at index `1`, and adding `1` to it results in `2`.

The values of the variables `n` and `j` are not modified by the print statement, and since `j` is given as `1`, the output state remains unchanged apart from the printed value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the function prints 2**
