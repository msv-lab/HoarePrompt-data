According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is given to be greater than 0 before the loop starts, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. After the first iteration, `n` would be decremented by 1, which means the loop will execute `n` times before the loop body is omitted. 

At the start of the loop, `j` should be initialized to 0, which is the first value in the range of `n`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes correctly:

1. `n` must still be greater than 0 at the start of the loop.
2. `j` must be initialized to 0 as the loop starts.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
