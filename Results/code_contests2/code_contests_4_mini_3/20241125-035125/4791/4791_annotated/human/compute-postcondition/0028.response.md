According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`, which means the loop would not execute again. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be adjusted to `n`, and `n` should be adjusted to be greater than `n`. 

Thus, the new state should reflect that `n` is greater than `0` (to ensure the loop can still execute), `j` should be equal to `n`, and the print statement should output `1` as before.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n`, and the print statement outputs 1**
