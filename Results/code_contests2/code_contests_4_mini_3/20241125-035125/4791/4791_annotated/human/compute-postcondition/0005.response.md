The code prints the result of `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. 

1. First, we calculate `j + 1`. Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` equals 2.
2. Next, we convert this value to binary using `bin(2)`, which results in the string `'0b10'`.
3. We then reverse this string using `[::-1]`, resulting in `'01b0'`.
4. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `'01b0'`. The first '1' is at index 1.
5. We then add 1 to this index, resulting in `1 + 1 = 2`.

The print statement outputs `2`. The values of the variables `N`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a valid integer greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2**.
