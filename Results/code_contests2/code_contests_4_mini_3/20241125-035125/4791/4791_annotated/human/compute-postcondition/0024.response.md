According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, which means that there is at least one valid iteration left. The variable `j` would have been incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration.

To determine the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that `j` must be less than `n` at the start of the next iteration. Since `n` is greater than 0, we can conclude that if `j` was at its maximum value for the last iteration (which is `n - 1`), then it would need to be adjusted to `n` for the loop to continue. Therefore, `j` must be adjusted to `n` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to n**
