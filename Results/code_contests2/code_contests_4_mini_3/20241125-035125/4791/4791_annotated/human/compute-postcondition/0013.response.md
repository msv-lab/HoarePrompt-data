The code calculates the position of the least significant bit (LSB) in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 0, `j + 1` equals 1. The binary representation of 1 is `'1'`. When reversed, it remains `'1'`, and the `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is 0. Adding 1 gives us the result 1.

Thus, the values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1**.
