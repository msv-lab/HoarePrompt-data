The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The parameter `N` is an integer that is constrained to be between 2 and 500 (inclusive). However, since the function does not take any inputs directly through its parameters, the behavior of the function regarding the value of `N` is not specified in the provided context. As such, we cannot determine the exact output or return value based on the input constraints alone.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified based on the given constraints for N.**
