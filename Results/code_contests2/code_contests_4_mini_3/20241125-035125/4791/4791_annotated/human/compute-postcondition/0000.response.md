The value of `n` is assigned the value from `input()`, which accepts input as a string. The previous value of `N` is not affected since `n` is a new variable, and it will hold the input value as a string. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and `n` is an input string**
