The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, it is reduced to a value of `n - 1`. The loop execution and outputs corresponding to the positions of the first '1' in the binary representations of integers from 1 to `n` are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, and now `n` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, and now `n` is `n - 1`**
