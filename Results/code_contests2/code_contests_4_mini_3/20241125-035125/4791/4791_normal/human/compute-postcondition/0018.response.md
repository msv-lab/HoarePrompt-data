According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` relative to `n`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`, meaning the loop cannot execute again since `j` is not less than `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain the same (greater than or equal to 1), and `j` must be incremented to `n + 1`. 

Thus, to allow for another iteration of the loop, we need to adjust `j` to be `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `n + 1`**
