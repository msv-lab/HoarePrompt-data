The operation `n -= 1` attempts to decrement `n` by 1. However, since `n` is initially a string representing an integer, this operation will raise a TypeError as strings cannot be directly decremented in Python. Therefore, the output state reflects that an error would occur due to this operation.

Output State: **TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'int'**
