The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It produces output based on the internal logic that is not specified in the provided information. As such, we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior without further details. However, it is known that the function's output will be related to the integer `N`, which is constrained to be between 2 and 500 (inclusive). 

Since there are no specific cases or conditions outlined in the output, we cannot describe the functionality further. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on an unspecified internal logic related to an integer N constrained between 2 and 500 (inclusive).**
