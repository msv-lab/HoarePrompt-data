The code `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)` performs the following actions:

1. The variable `j` has a value of `2`.
2. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to `3`.
3. The `bin(3)` function converts `3` to its binary representation, which is `'0b11'`.
4. The slicing `[::-1]` reverses the string, resulting in `'11b0'`.
5. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string. The first `'1'` is found at index `0`.
6. Adding `1` to the index `0` results in `1`.

The print statement outputs `1`. 

The values of the other variables `N` and `n` are unchanged, and `j` remains `2`. The output of the print statement is `1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a string representing an integer greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1**.
