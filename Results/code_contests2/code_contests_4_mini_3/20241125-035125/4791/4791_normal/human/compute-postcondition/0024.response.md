According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop is set to execute while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, which means that at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1. Since `n` is still greater than 1, it will allow for another iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the printed value is 1**
