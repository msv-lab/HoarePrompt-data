The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` calculates the position of the first '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and adds 1 to that position. 

Given that `j` is 1, we first compute `j + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`. The binary representation of 2 is `10`. When reversed, this becomes `01`. The first occurrence of '1' is at index 1 (0-based index), so we add 1 to get the final result of 2.

None of the other variables (`N` and `n`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a string representing an integer greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 2**
