According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and `j` is at its maximum value of `n - 1` (since `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented from `n - 1` to `n`, which means `j` will now be equal to `n`. Consequently, the loop will not execute again unless `n` is increased. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1**
