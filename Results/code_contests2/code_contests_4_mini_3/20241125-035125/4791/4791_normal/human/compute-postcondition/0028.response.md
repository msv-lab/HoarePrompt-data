According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since `n` is greater than 2, it will allow the loop to execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the result of the print statement is 1**
