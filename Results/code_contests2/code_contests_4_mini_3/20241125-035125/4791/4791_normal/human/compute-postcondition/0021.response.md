The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, the new value of `n` will be `n - 1`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, and now `n` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, and now `n` is decremented by 1**
