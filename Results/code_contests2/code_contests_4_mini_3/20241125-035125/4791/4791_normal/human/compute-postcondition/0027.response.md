The code calculates the position of the least significant bit that is set to 1 in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Here, `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2. The binary representation of 2 is '10'. When reversed, it becomes '01'. The `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is 0. Adding 1 gives a final result of 1.

The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged during this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 1**
