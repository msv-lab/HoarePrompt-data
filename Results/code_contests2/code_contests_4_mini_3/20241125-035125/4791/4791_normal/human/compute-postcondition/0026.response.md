According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2 to ensure that `j` can increment to the next value (which would be 2).

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `n` needs to be greater than 2.
- `j` should be set to 1 as it is the current value before the next increment.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 1**
