Output State: **If n is a non-negative integer, the loop will execute n times, and the output will be the positions of the first '1' in the binary representations of numbers from 1 to n, printed sequentially. If n is less than 0, the loop does not execute, and no output will be produced. In this case, `n` remains unchanged.**
