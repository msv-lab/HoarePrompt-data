The code calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, which is `1` in this case since `j` is `0`. The binary representation of `1` is `0b1`, and when reversed, it remains `1`. The `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is `0`. Adding `1` to this index results in `1`. The state of the other variables does not change. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 0, and the printed value is `1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 0, and the printed value is 1**
