According to the code, the error `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'int'` indicates that there is an attempt to perform a subtraction operation where one operand is a string and the other is an integer. This suggests that a variable involved in the loop or the loop body is incorrectly initialized as a string when it should be an integer.

For the loop to execute correctly, `n` must be an integer (greater than or equal to 0) to ensure that the range can be valid, and also the variable that is being decremented (not explicitly shown in the provided snippet) must be an integer. Therefore, the state must be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and the variable being decremented is an integer**
