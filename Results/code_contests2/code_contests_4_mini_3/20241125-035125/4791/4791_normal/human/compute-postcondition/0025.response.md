The value of `j` is 1. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to 2. The binary representation of 2 is `10`. When reversed, it becomes `01`. The `find('1')` function locates the first occurrence of '1', which is at index 0. Adding 1 to this index gives us a final value of 1.

The printed value is 1, and the states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the printed value is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the printed value is 1**
