The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input. Since `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), the value of `n` will be a string representation of whatever input is given. The previous integer value of `N` does not affect `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and `n` is an input string**
