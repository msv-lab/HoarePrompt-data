According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop executes as long as `n` is non-zero (true). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is mentioned to be greater than 0, which means it is currently positive. Therefore, the loop can execute again without requiring any adjustments to `n`.

State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes `n` times with `j` taking values from 0 to `n-1`, and the printed values will be 1 for all iterations.**
