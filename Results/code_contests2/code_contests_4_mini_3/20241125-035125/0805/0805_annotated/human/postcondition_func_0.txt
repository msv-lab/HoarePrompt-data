The function accepts an integer input `n` and a string of uppercase English letters `strings`. It shifts each letter in the string by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary, and prints the resulting transformed string. If `strings` is empty, the function outputs an empty string. However, the function does not handle invalid inputs for `n` (e.g., non-integer values or values outside the range of 0 to 26), which could lead to runtime errors.
