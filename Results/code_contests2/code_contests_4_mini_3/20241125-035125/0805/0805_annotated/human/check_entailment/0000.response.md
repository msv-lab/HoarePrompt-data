Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads an integer `N` and a string `S`, and then shifts each character in `S` by `N` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around from `Z` to `A` as needed.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It reads the integer `n` from input, which represents the number of positions to shift each character.
2. It reads the string `strings` which consists of uppercase English letters.
3. It defines a string `letters` containing all uppercase English letters.
4. It initializes an empty string `new_strings` to build the resulting shifted string.
5. It iterates through each character `s` in the input string `strings`.
    - It finds the index of the character `s` in the `letters` string.
    - It calculates the new index by adding the shift `n` to the current index and taking the modulo with 26 to wrap around if necessary.
    - It appends the character at the new index to the `new_strings`.
6. Finally, it prints the resulting shifted string.

The handling of the wraparound is correctly implemented with the modulo operation, ensuring that characters are appropriately shifted even when they exceed the bounds of the alphabet.

Given the constraints (0 ≤ N ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^4), and since the input is strictly uppercase English letters, the program is robust against the specified input range. 

Additionally, it correctly handles edge cases:
- When `N` is 0, the output is the same as the input.
- When `N` is equal to 26, the output is also the same as the input since it wraps around the alphabet completely.

Overall, the implementation meets all requirements stated in the problem description, and I could not find any potential cases where it would fail. Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
