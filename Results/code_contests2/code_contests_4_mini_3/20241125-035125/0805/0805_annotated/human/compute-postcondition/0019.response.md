The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is `index + n`, where `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, and `n` is a previously defined integer. Since `added_index` is calculated based on the values of `index` and `n`, the result of `added_index % 26` will give `new_index` a value between 0 and 25, inclusive. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `new_strings` is equal to its previous value concatenated with `new_s`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `strings` has at least `index + 3` elements, `added_index` is `index + n`, and `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.

Output State: **`new_strings` is equal to its previous value concatenated with `new_s`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `strings` has at least `index + 3` elements, `added_index` is `index + n`, and `new_index` is `added_index % 26`**
