The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state of `S` is unchanged, and `N` remains as is since it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `S` and `N`, while introducing the new variable `n` which holds the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, and `n` is an input integer**
