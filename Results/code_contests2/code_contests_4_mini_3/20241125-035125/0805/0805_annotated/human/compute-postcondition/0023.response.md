Output State: **`new_strings` is the result of shifting each character in `strings` by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. If `strings` is empty, the loop does not execute and `new_strings` remains an empty string. If `N` is less than 0 or greater than 26, it is not relevant as the loop does not depend on `N` but rather on `n` which should be in the range of 0 to 26.**
