To determine the output state, we analyze the effect of the code snippet provided. 

1. `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, which consists of uppercase English letters ('A' to 'Z'). This means `index` can take a value from 0 to 25, depending on what the first character `s` is.
2. `n` is an integer that can range from 0 to 26.
3. The code `added_index = index + n` assigns the sum of `index` and `n` to `added_index`.

Since `index` is determined by the first character of `strings` and `n` is an input integer, the exact value of `added_index` will depend on the specific values of `index` and `n`. 

Thus, the impact of the code is that `added_index` will be equal to `index + n`, which could produce a range of outputs based on the values of `index` and `n`. 

The output state encapsulates the current values of the relevant variables and indicates the calculation that has taken place. 

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, and `added_index` is equal to `index + n`**.
