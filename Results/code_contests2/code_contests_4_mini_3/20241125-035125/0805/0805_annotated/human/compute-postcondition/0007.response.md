The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. Since `added_index` is calculated as `index + n`, we need to consider the values of `index` and `n`. The value of `new_index` will be the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26. 

Since the initial state indicates that `N` is an integer in the range of 0 to 26, and `n` is an input integer, the values of `index` and `n` will affect `added_index` and consequently `new_index`. However, without specific values for `index` and `n`, we can only determine that `new_index` will be in the range of `0` to `25` (inclusive), as the modulo operation with 26 will yield a result in this range.

Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is equal to `index + n`, and `new_index` is in the range 0 to 25.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is equal to `index + n`, and `new_index` is in the range 0 to 25.**
