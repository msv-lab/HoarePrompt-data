To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze the variables involved.

1. `new_strings` is initially an empty string.
2. `s` is the first character of `strings`, and its value is taken from `strings`.
3. `index` is the index of `s` in `letters` (which is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ').
4. `added_index` is calculated as `index + n`, where `n` is an input integer such that 0 <= N <= 26.
5. `new_index` is defined to be in the range 0 to 25, which ensures it wraps around if `added_index` exceeds 25.
6. `new_s` is the letter at `letters[new_index]`.

The operation `new_strings += new_s` concatenates `new_s` to `new_strings`. Since `new_strings` starts as an empty string, after this operation, `new_strings` will contain only `new_s`.

However, we must keep in mind that the actual values of `s`, `index`, `added_index`, `new_index`, and `new_s` depend on the specific input values, which are not provided.

Thus, we can summarize the output state as follows, since `new_strings` is updated with the new character derived from the calculations:

Output State: **`new_strings` is now equal to `new_s`, which is the letter at `letters[new_index]` derived from `s`, `index`, and `n`.**
