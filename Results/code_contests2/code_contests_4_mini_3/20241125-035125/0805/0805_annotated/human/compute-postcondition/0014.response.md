The variable `new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`. The previous state indicates that `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`. Given that `added_index` is `index + n`, it implies that `new_index` will yield a valid index to access the `letters` array. Therefore, `new_s` will be the corresponding value in `letters` at the position `new_index`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_strings` is now equal to `new_s`, `index` is now the index of `s` in `letters`, `strings` has at least `index + 2` elements, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, and `new_s` is letters[new_index]**.
