The function `func` does not take any parameters directly, but it operates on two predefined inputs: `S` and `N`. Here, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, and `N` is an integer such that \(0 \leq N \leq 26\). The length of `S` is between 1 and 10,000 characters. 

The function output is not explicitly provided in the prompt. Therefore, based on the constraints and the absence of further details, we cannot determine the specific return value or functionality of the function. 

However, we can summarize the accepted inputs:

Functionality: **The function operates on a string `S` of uppercase English letters and an integer `N` where \(0 \leq N \leq 26\), but the specific output or behavior of the function is not detailed.**
