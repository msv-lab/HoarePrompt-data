`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`. The value of `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`, and `added_index` is `index + n`. The previous values of `index`, `n`, and `letters` affect the outcome, but the specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `new_s` now holds a new value based on the provided calculations.

Output State: **`new_strings` is equal to its previous value concatenated with `new_s`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `strings` has at least `index + 3` elements, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, and `new_s` is `letters[new_index]`.**
