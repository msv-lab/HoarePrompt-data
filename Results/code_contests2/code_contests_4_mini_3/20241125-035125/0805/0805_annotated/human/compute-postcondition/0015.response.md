The value of `new_strings` is updated by appending `new_s` to it. The previous state of `new_strings` is not specified, but it is expanded with the value of `new_s`. The values of `index`, `strings`, `added_index`, `new_index`, and `new_s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `new_strings`.

Output State: **`new_strings` is now equal to its previous value concatenated with `new_s`, `index` is now the index of `s` in `letters`, `strings` has at least `index + 2` elements, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, and `new_s` is letters[new_index]**
