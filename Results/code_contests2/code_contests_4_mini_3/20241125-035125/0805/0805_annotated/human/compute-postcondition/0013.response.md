The value of `new_index` is assigned the result of `added_index % 26`. The previous value of `added_index` is `index + n`, and since `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, and `n` is some integer, the output state will depend on the specific values of `index` and `n`. However, since we only know that `added_index` is `index + n`, we can state that `new_index` will be the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26.

Thus, the output state remains focused on the variables we know:

Output State: **`new_strings` is now equal to `new_s`, `index` is now the index of `s` in `letters`, `strings` has at least `index + 2` elements, `added_index` is `index + n`, and `new_index` is `added_index % 26`**
