The value of `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The variable `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, and `n` is an unknown value. Since `added_index` depends on both `index` and `n`, the specific value of `added_index` cannot be determined without knowing `n`. Other variables (`new_strings`, `strings`, `new_index`, and `new_s`) remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`new_strings` is now equal to its previous value concatenated with `new_s`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `strings` has at least `index + 3` elements, `added_index` is `index + n`**
