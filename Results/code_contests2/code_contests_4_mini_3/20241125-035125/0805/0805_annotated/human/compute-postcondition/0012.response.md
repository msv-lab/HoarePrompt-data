The code assigns the value of `index + n` to `added_index`. The value of `index` is known as the index of `s` in `letters`, and `n` is a specified value, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, `added_index` will depend on the specific value of `n`.

Since `n` is not specified, the output state will indicate that `added_index` is determined based on the values of `index` and `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_strings` is now equal to `new_s`, `index` is now the index of `s` in `letters`, `strings` has at least `index + 2` elements, and `added_index` is `index + n`.**
