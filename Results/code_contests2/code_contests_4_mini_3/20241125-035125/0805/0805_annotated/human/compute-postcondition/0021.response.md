The value of `new_strings` is updated by concatenating `new_s` to it. The previous value of `new_strings` is its prior state, and `new_s` is derived from the `letters` list using the calculated `new_index`. Therefore, the output state is: `new_strings` is equal to its previous value concatenated with `new_s`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `strings` has at least `index + 3` elements, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, and `new_s` is `letters[new_index]`.
