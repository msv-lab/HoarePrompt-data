According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `strings` variable. The loop will execute if `strings` is not empty. Since `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop but may relate to constraints on `S` or `strings` in other parts of the code. 

For the loop to execute, the `strings` variable must contain at least one character. Additionally, since `s` will take on the value of each character in `strings`, we can assume that `s` will start as the first character of `strings`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to indicate that `strings` is not empty, `s` is the first character of `strings`, and `new_strings` is still an empty string.

State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`**
