The value of `new_index` is assigned the result of `added_index % 26`. The variable `added_index` has a specific value derived from the sum of `index` and `n`, but the exact values of `index` and `n` are not provided. Therefore, we can state that `new_index` will be the remainder of `added_index` when divided by 26. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26`**
