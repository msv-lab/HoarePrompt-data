The code snippet adds `new_s` to `new_strings`. The value of `new_s` is determined by `letters[new_index]`, and `new_index` is derived from `added_index % 26`. The variables `added_index`, `new_index`, and `new_s` are dependent on the values of `index`, `n`, and `letters`, but we do not have the specific values for these variables. However, `new_strings` is affected as it receives the value of `new_s`.

Therefore, the output state is: `added_index` is `index + n`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26`; `new_s` is letters[new_index]; `new_strings` is updated with the value of `new_s`.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26`; `new_s` is letters[new_index]; `new_strings` is updated with the value of `new_s`**
