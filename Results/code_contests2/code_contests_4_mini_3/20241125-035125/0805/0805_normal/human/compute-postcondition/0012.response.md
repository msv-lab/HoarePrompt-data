To determine the output state, we will analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state.

1. `added_index` is assigned the value `index + n`.
2. The variable `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, and `n` is an integer such that `0 <= N <= 26`.
3. Therefore, `added_index` will be the sum of the index of `s` in the string `letters` and the value of `n`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `index`, `n`, or `s`, we will denote the changes in terms of these variables:

- `added_index` is now `index + n`.

The output state reflects the new value of `added_index` based on the calculation. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`**
