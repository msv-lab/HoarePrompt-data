The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The previous values of `index` and `n` are known, where `index` is the position of `s` in `letters` and `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26. The output state will reflect the new calculated value of `added_index` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, and `added_index` is `index + n`.**
