The function `func` accepts two parameters: `S` and `N`. `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, and `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26. After executing the function body, it returns a modified version of the string `S` based on the value of `N`. The specific output behavior is not detailed, but it is implied that the function processes the string in conjunction with the integer parameter.
