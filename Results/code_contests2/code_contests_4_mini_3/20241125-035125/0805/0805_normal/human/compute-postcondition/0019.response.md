The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is `index + n`, but since we do not know the specific values of `index` and `n`, we can only express `new_index` in terms of these variables. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `index` is the index of character `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, and `new_index` is `(index + n) % 26`.

Output State: **`index` is the index of character `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, and `new_index` is `(index + n) % 26**
