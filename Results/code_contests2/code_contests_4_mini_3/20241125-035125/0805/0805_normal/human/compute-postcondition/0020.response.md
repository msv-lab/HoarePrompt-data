The variable `new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`. The value of `new_index` is calculated as `(index + n) % 26`. The states of the other variables (`index`, `added_index`, and `letters`) are not directly affected. Therefore, the output state is: `index` is the index of character `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `(index + n) % 26`, and `new_s` is the character at `letters[new_index]`.

Output State: **`index` is the index of character `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `(index + n) % 26`, `new_s` is the character at `letters[new_index]`**
