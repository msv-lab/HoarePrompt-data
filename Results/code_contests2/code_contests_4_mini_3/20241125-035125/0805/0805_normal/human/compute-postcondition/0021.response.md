The variable `new_s` is added to `new_strings`. The values of `index`, `added_index`, `new_index`, and `new_s` are not directly changed by this operation, but `new_strings` will now contain the character `new_s`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current status of the variables involved. 

Output State: **`index` is the index of character `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `(index + n) % 26`, `new_s` is the character at `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`.**
