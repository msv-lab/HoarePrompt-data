Output State: **`new_strings` is a string consisting of characters shifted by `n` positions in the alphabet based on the characters in `strings`. If `strings` is non-empty, the loop executes for each character in `strings`. If `strings` is empty, the loop does not execute and `new_strings` remains an empty string. `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, and `n` is an input integer. `s` is each character in `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, and `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
