Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` (which represents the number of positions to shift) and a string `strings` consisting of uppercase English letters. It returns a new string where each letter from `strings` is shifted by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. If `strings` is empty, the function returns an empty string. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the range of 0 to 26. **
