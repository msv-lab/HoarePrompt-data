To analyze the given code snippet, we first need to understand the initial state and how it affects the outcome.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `added_index` is defined as `index + n`.
   - `new_index` is defined as `added_index % 26`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `new_s = letters[new_index]` assigns the value from the `letters` list (or string) at the position `new_index`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `index`, `n`, or the content of `letters`, we cannot determine exact values for `added_index` or `new_index`. However, we know:

- `new_index` will always be a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive) due to the modulus operation with 26.
- `new_s` will be assigned the character or item from `letters` at the calculated `new_index`.

Since the specific values of `index`, `n`, and `letters` are not provided, we can summarize the output state based on the calculations and assignments:

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26`; `new_s` is letters[new_index]**.
