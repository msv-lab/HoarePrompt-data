The value of `added_index` is assigned the result of `index + n`. The previous values of `index` and `n` are used to compute `added_index`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `index` is the index of character `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `(added_index + 1) % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is updated with `new_s`.

Output State: **`index` is the index of character `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `(added_index + 1) % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is updated with `new_s`**
