Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to shift each character of the string `S` by `N` in alphabetical order. It handles the wrapping around from `Z` to `A` properly using the modulo operation. 

1. It reads the integer `N` and the string `S` from input.
2. It constructs a string `letters` that contains all uppercase English letters.
3. It initializes an empty string `new_strings` to accumulate the shifted characters.
4. For each character in `S`, it finds its index in `letters`, adds `N` to that index, and then uses modulo 26 to find the new index. This ensures that if the index exceeds 25 (the index for `Z`), it wraps around correctly.
5. The new character is then appended to `new_strings`, and finally, it prints the resulting string.

Examples provided in the problem statement match the output of the code, and the logic accounts for all potential edge cases, including:
- Shifting by 0, which returns the original string.
- Shifting by values that wrap around, such as shifting `Y` by 3 to get `B`.

Since I could not identify any input that would cause the program to malfunction or produce incorrect results, I conclude that the program is correct.
