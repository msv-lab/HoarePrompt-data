The function does not accept any parameters and uses a sieve method to identify prime numbers up to 999,999. It counts and prints the number of prime numbers from index 1 to each integer provided via standard input. If the input integer `s` is less than 2, the printed count will be 0, as there are no primes less than 2. The function can handle multiple inputs, but it does not explicitly limit the number of datasets processed.
