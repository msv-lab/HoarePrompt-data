Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 2, and `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements initially set to `True`. If `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]`) is `True`, then all elements at indices that are multiples of `i` starting from `i^2 - 1` (i.e., index 3) up to but not including 1,000,000 are set to `False`. Thus, in this case, all even indices starting from 3 will be marked as `False` in `a`, while the elements at indices 0, 1, and 2 remain `True`. If `a[i - 1]` is `False`, no changes occur to the list `a`.***
