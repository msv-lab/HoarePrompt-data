The code assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` in the list `a`. Given that `j` is 3, the value of `a[3]` is changed from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` set to `False`, and `j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` set to `False`, `j` is 3**
