Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 4, and `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where the first three elements are `True` and all even indices starting from 3 are marked as `False`. If `a[3]` is `True`, then for all `j` values from 15 to 999,999 in steps of 4, `a[j]` is set to `False`. If `a[3]` is `False`, then the list `a` remains unchanged.***
