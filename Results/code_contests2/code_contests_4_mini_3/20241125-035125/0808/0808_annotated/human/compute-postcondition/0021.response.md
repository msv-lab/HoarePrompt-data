Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 3, and `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where the first three elements are `True` and all even indices starting from 3 are marked as `False`. If `a[2]` (which corresponds to `a[i - 1]`) is `True`, then all elements at indices that are multiples of `i` starting from `i^2 - 1` (which is 8) up to 999,999 are set to `False`. If `a[2]` is `False`, there are no changes made to the list `a`.***
