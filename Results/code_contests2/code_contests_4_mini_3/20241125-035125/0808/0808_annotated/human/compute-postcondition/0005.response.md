To determine how to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided state and the for loop.

1. The loop iterates over a range defined by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`. 
2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. The starting point for the loop is `i ** 2 - 1`, which means we need to compute `i ** 2 - 1`.
3. Given that `i` is 2, we calculate:
   - \( i^2 - 1 = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \).
4. The range for the loop will then be `range(3, 1000000, 2)`, which means it starts from 3 and continues in steps of 2 up to (but not including) 1,000,000.
5. The variable `j` will take values starting from 3 and increment by 2 in each iteration: 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., up to 999,999.
6. Since `j` is currently 3, the next value of `j` after this iteration will be 5.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The value of `j` should be adjusted to 5 (the next value in the sequence).
- There are no other states that need to be adjusted as `n` and `a` do not affect the execution of this specific loop.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` set to `False`, `j` is 5**
