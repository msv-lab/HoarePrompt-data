To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the current values of `i`, `j`, and the loop conditions.

1. The loop condition is `for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`. 
2. The value of `i` is currently 3. Therefore, `i ** 2 - 1` equals `3 ** 2 - 1`, which is `9 - 1 = 8`.
3. The range of `j` in the loop will be from `8` to `999,999` (not inclusive) with a step of `3`.

Since `j` is currently `8`, in the next iteration, `j` will take on the next value in the range, which is `11` (8 + 3). 

To summarize:
- The current value of `j` is `8`.
- The next value of `j` as it progresses through the loop should be `11`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it does not affect the current loop's execution.

Thus, the adjusted states will be:
- `j` needs to be updated to `11`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with the first three elements being `True`, all even indices starting from 3 marked as `False`, and `j` is 11**
