Output State: **`a` will have all elements at indices that are multiples of `i` starting from `i**2 - 1` up to 999,999 set to `False`. If `i**2 - 1` is greater than or equal to 1,000,000, the loop will not execute, and `a` will remain unchanged. If `i` is less than 3, the loop will not execute as the starting index will not be valid, and `a` will also remain unchanged.**
