Output State: **If n is between 1 and 999,999, the loop will execute for each integer i from 2 to 999,999. The array `a` will be modified such that for each prime number found, all its multiples starting from i^2 - 1 will be set to `False`. After the loop completes, `a` will contain `True` for indices that correspond to prime numbers up to 999,999, and `False` for all non-prime indices. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute and `a` will remain a list of 1,000,000 elements all set to `True`.**
