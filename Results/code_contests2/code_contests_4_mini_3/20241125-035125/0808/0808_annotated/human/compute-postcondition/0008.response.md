The code assigns `False` to `a[j]`, where `j` is 7. The previous state of `a[7]` is not provided, but it will now be set to `False`. The values of the other variables `n`, `i`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is 2; `a[3]` is False; `a[5]` is False; `a[7]` is False; `j` is 7.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is 2; `a[3]` is False; `a[5]` is False; `a[7]` is False; `j` is 7**
