To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop parameters:

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):`. The starting point for `j` is `i ** 2 - 1`, and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` each time.

2. Given the current state:
   - `i` is 3.
   - The starting value of `j` would be `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8`.
   - The loop increments `j` by `i`, which is 3, so `j` would take values: 8, 11, 14, 17, ..., until it reaches or exceeds 1,000,000.

3. The last executed value of `j` is 14, and the next value of `j` would be `14 + 3 = 17`.

4. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` (which would be 17 next) is still less than 1,000,000. Since 17 is indeed less than 1,000,000, the loop will execute again.

No adjustments are necessary to the value of `i`, as it remains 3, and thus the loop conditions are satisfied.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is 3; `a[11]` is set to False; `a[14]` is set to False; `j` is 17**
