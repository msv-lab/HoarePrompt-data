The statement `a[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` of the list `a`. Since `j` has a value of 19, this means that `a[19]` is set to `False`. The previous value of `a[19]` is not known, but the assignment itself does not affect the other variables in the program. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `a[19]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 4, `a[15]` is False, `a[19]` is False, `j` is 19**
