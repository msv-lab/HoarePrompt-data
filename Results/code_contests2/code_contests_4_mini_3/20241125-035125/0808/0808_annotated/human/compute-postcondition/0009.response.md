According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and the upper limit of the range, which is 1,000,000. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means the starting value for `j` in the next iteration would be calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`. The loop will then increment `j` by `i` (which is 2) in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 7. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than 1,000,000. Since the next value of `j` would be `7 + 2 = 9`, which is still less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute again without needing to modify `i` or the range limit.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to update `j` to reflect its next value in the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is 2; `a[3]` is False; `a[5]` is False; `a[7]` is False; `j` is 9**
