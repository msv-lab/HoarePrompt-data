The value of `a[j]` is assigned to `False`, but `a[11]` is already set to `False`, and the other elements of `a` are not affected. Since `j` is 14, the value of `a[14]` is also set to `False`. The output state indicates that the state of `a` is updated for index `j`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is 3; `a[11]` is set to False; `a[14]` is set to False; `j` is 14**
