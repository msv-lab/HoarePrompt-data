According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the upper limit of the loop, which is 1,000,000. The loop iterates starting from `i ** 2 - 1` to 1,000,000 in increments of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, so we calculate the starting point of the loop:
- \( i^2 - 1 = 3^2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8 \)

The loop starts at `j = 11`. In this case, since `j` is 11, we need to determine if `j` is still less than 1,000,000 and if it can be incremented by `i` (which is 3) for the next iteration. 

The next value of `j` would be:
- \( j + i = 11 + 3 = 14 \)

Since 14 is still less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute one more time. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state for `j` to reflect the next value in the iteration. The other states do not require any adjustments.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is 3; `a` has `a[11]` set to `False`; `j` is 14**
