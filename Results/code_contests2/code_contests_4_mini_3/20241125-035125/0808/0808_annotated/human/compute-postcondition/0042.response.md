The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates within the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, and it is implied that there can be up to 30 datasets processed. The output functionality is not explicitly defined, but it is expected to handle the provided datasets based on the constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process datasets based on the integer `n` within the specified range and limit.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes up to 30 datasets based on the integer n, which must be between 1 and 999,999.**
