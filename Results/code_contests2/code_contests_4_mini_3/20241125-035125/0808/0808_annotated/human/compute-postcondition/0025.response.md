According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `i` is 4.
- `j` is 15.

The loop initializes `j` to `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `4 ** 2 - 1 = 15`. The next value of `j` in the loop will be incremented by `i`, which is 4. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `15 + 4 = 19`.

Since 19 is still less than 1,000,000, the loop will execute one more time.

Thus, the only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `j` becomes 19.

The other states (`n`, `i`, and `a`) do not need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop's continuation.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 4, `a` is a list where `a[15]` is `False`, `j` is 19**
