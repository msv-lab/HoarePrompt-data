The statement `a[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `j` of the array `a`. Given that `j` is 23, it means that `a[23]` is set to `False`. The initial state does not provide any values for `a` beyond indices 15 and 19, but it indicates that `a[15]` is `False` and `a[19]` is `False`. The values of `n`, `i`, and the other indices of `a` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 4, `a[15]` is False, `a[19]` is False, `a[23]` is False, `j` is 23**
