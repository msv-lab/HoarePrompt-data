To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop statement.

1. The loop iterates with `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` until it reaches 1,000,000.
2. The first step is to calculate the value of `i ** 2 - 1`. Given that `i` is 3, we have:
   - `i ** 2 - 1 = 3 ** 2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8`.
3. Hence, the loop starts at `j = 8`.
4. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. Since `j` starts at 8 and increments by `i` (which is 3), the subsequent values of `j` will be 8, 11, 14, 17, ... until it reaches or exceeds 1,000,000.
5. There are no constraints on the values of `n`, `i`, or `a` that would prevent the loop from executing, assuming that the range for `j` is appropriate according to the loop statement.

Since the initial state of `i` is 3, which meets the condition for the loop to execute, and the starting point of `j` is calculated to be 8, we only need to confirm that the loop can indeed execute.

Thus, the final state before the loop can be described as:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with the first three elements being `True`, and all even indices starting from 3 marked as `False`, `j` is 8**
