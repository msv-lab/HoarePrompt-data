Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[2]` is True, and `i` is 4. If `a[3]` is True (since `i - 1` is 3), then all elements in `a` starting from index 15 up to 999,999 (inclusive), which are multiples of `i` (4), are set to False. If `a[3]` is False, the list `a` remains unchanged.***
