According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `j` must be less than 1,000,000. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 3, which means `i ** 2 - 1` equals 8. 
- `j` is currently 14.

In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `i`, which is 3. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be 14 + 3 = 17.

Since 17 is still less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute one more time.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` has the 9th element set to False, the 11th element set to False, the 14th element set to False; `i` is 3; `j` is 17**
