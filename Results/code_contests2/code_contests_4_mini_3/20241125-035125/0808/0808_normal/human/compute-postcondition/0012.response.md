According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which is less than 1,000,000. Therefore, the loop can execute again. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it will be 3 in the next iteration. The list `a` remains unchanged as it is initialized to True for all elements. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements initialized to True, `i` is 3**
