The loop iterates over the range defined by `i ** 2 - 1` to `1000000`, incrementing by `i` in each iteration. Given that `i` is 4, the starting point for `j` would be `4 ** 2 - 1 = 15`. The loop will mark every `j` in that range as `False` in the list `a`. 

The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `1000000`. The values of `j` will be `15, 19, 23, ...` and will continue until it reaches or exceeds `1000000`. 

Let's analyze the potential cases:

1. If `i` is less than 4, the starting value of `j` would be less than 15, which means the loop would still execute but start from a different index.
2. If `i` is greater than 4, the starting value of `j` would be greater than 15, potentially skipping the initial marking of `False` for `a[15]` and subsequent indices.
3. If `i` equals 0 or is negative, the loop would not execute since the range would be invalid.
4. If `i` is set to a value that results in the starting value of `j` being greater than or equal to `1000000`, the loop would not execute at all.

Given these considerations, the output state would reflect the completed iterations and cover the cases where the loop does not execute.

Output State: **`j` is the last value less than 1000000 that was marked as False in `a`, which starts from 15 and increments by 4. If `i` is less than 4 then `j` starts from `i ** 2 - 1` and marks every `j` until `j` reaches or exceeds 1000000. If `i` is greater than or equal to 500 (as `i ** 2 - 1` would be 249999), the loop will not execute and `a[15]` remains True. If `i` is less than 0 or 0 the loop does not execute and `a` remains unchanged.**
