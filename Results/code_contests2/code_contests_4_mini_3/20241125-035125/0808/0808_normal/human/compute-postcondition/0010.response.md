The loop is designed to mark certain indices in the list `a` as False based on the value of `i`. Specifically, it starts from the index `i ** 2 - 1` and marks every `i`-th index as False.

- If `i` is 2, the loop will execute starting from `3` (since `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`) and will mark every even index (greater than or equal to 3) as False. 
- The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `1000000`.

Let's consider the edge cases as well:
- If `i` were to be set to a value that results in `i ** 2 - 1` being greater than or equal to `1000000`, the loop would not execute at all since `j` would not satisfy the condition for the range.

Given that `i` starts at 2 and remains 2 throughout the loop execution, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with all odd indices greater than or equal to 3 set to False, `i` is 2, `j` is the last index marked as False before reaching 1000000. If `i` is such that `i ** 2 - 1` is greater than or equal to 1000000, then the loop does not execute and `a` remains a list of 1,000,000 elements all set to True.**
