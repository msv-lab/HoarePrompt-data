To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop statement and the current values of the variables involved.

The loop statement is:
```
for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
```
Here, `i` is 4, so we can calculate the initial start of the range:
- The start value is `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `4 ** 2 - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15`.
- The end value is `1000000`.
- The step is `i`, which is `4`.

The range function in Python will generate values starting from 15 up to but not including 1000000, incrementing by 4 each time. 

Now, we need to consider the current value of `j`. The last value of `j` in the previous iteration is determined by the loop's behavior:
- The first value of `j` would be 15 (the start of the range).
- Subsequent values would be 19, 23, and so on, incrementing by 4 each time.

Given that `j` is currently 23 at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `j` would be:
- `23 + 4 = 27`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the new value of `j` (27) is still less than 1000000, which it is.

Thus, the only necessary adjustment is to update `j`:
- `j` should be 27.

No other states need to be adjusted since the conditions for the loop to continue (i.e., starting from 15 and stepping by 4) are still valid.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a[2]` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is 27, `a[15]` is False, `a[19]` is False, `a[23]` is False**
