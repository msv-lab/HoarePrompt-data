Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements initialized to True. If `a[i - 1]` is True (which is the case since `i` is 2), then all multiples of `i` from `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 3) up to 999,999 will be set to False in the list `a`, marking all odd indices greater than or equal to 3 as False. If `i` is such that `i` is not 2 (which cannot occur in this context), this block would not execute, but as per the precondition, we ensure that `a` has the appropriate values set based on this condition.***
