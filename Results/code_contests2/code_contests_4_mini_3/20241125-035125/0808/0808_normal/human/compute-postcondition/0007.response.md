To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. The loop iterates over the range defined by `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` until it reaches `1000000`. 
2. At the end of the previous iteration, we have `i` as 2, which means `i ** 2 - 1` evaluates to `2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`.
3. The loop's starting point for `j` is therefore `3`. 
4. Given that `j` is currently `5`, this means that the loop has already executed for `j = 3` and `j = 4`, and is now at `j = 5`.
5. The next value of `j` would be calculated as `j + i`, which is `5 + 2 = 7`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that `j` can take on the value `7`, which is still less than `1000000`. 

No other variables or conditions need to be adjusted since `n` is within the permitted range, and the list `a` does not affect the loop's execution in this context.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[1]` is True, `a[3]` is False, `a[5]` is False; `i` is 2; `j` is 7**
