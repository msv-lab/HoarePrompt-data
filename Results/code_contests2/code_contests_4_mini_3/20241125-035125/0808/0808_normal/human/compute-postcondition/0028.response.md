`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `j` is 23, so `a[23]` is set to `False`. This does not change the values of other variables, including `n`, `i`, `a[2]`, `a[15]`, and `a[19]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a[23]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a[2]` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is 23, `a[15]` is False, `a[19]` is False, `a[23]` is False**
