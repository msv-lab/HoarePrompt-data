The value of `a[j]` is assigned `False`, where `j` is 7. Since the list `a` has 1,000,000 elements and the previous state of `a[7]` is not specified, we can only confirm that `a[7]` is now `False`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a[1]` is True, `a[3]` is False, `a[5]` is False, `a[7]` is False; `i` is 2; `j` is 7.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a[1]` is True, `a[3]` is False, `a[5]` is False, `a[7]` is False; `i` is 2; `j` is 7**
