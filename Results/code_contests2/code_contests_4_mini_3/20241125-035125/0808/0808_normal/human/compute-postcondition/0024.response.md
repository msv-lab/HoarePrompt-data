`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `a[15]` is not specified, but `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a[2]` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is 15, and `a[15]` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a[2]` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is 15, and `a[15]` is False**
