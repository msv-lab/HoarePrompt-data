Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where, if `a[i - 1]` is True (which it is since `i` is 3), all elements of `a` from index 8 to 999,998 are set to False due to the loop, which marks every i-th element starting from (3**2 - 1) up to 999,999 as False. If `a[2]` (or `a[i - 1]`) were to be False, the loop would not execute, and all elements of `a` would remain True.***
