The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It is designed to process input data sets, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999. The function handles at most 30 datasets provided as input. The specifics of the output are not provided in the information given, but it is implied that the function will produce results based on the datasets processed. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to process up to 30 datasets, with each dataset containing an integer `n` within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function processes up to 30 datasets of integers where each integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999.**
