According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and the upper limit of the loop, which is 1,000,000. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 8, and since `i` is 3, we need to calculate the starting value for the next iteration. The loop starts from `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 9`. In the first iteration, `j` is incremented by `i`, making the next value of `j` equal to 8 + 3 = 11.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 11, and since we are already starting from `j` equal to 8, the next value will need to be less than 1,000,000.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` has the 9th element set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is 11**
