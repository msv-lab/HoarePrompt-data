According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variables `i` and the calculated starting index for `j`. The loop will execute as long as the starting index calculated by `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1,000,000. 

Given that `i` is 2, we can compute the starting index:
- Starting index: `i ** 2 - 1 = 2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`.

Now, we need to ensure that this starting index (3) is within the valid range for the loop to execute, which it is because 3 is less than 1,000,000.

Additionally, before the loop starts, we should state the current values of `j`, `i`, and `a`. Since `i` is 2 and `j` will start from 3, and `a` is a list of True values, we need to capture these states.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements all set to True, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and the element at index 1 of `a` is True.**
