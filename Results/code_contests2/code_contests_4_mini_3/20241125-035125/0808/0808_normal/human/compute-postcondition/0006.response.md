The value of `a[j]` is assigned to `False`. Here, `j` is 5, so `a[5]` is set to `False`. The previous state of `a[3]` was also `False`, but it does not affect the current assignment. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `a[5]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[1]` is True, `a[3]` is False, `a[5]` is False; `i` is 2; `j` is 5**
