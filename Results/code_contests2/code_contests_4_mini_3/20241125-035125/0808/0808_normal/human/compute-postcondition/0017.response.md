According to the code, the loop will execute again if the value of `j` is less than 1,000,000. The loop's range is defined by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`, which means it starts at `i ** 2 - 1`, increments by `i`, and continues until it reaches 1,000,000 (exclusive).

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 3, so `i ** 2 - 1` equals `3 ** 2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8`.
- The current value of `j` is 11.

The loop will execute again if the next value of `j` (which will be 11 + 3 = 14) is less than 1,000,000. Since 14 is indeed less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute one more time.

Thus, the values of `j`, which will be incremented by `i` in the next iteration, need to be adjusted. The next value of `j` should be set to 14.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a` has the 9th element set to False, the 11th element is now set to False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14**
