The code sets the element at index `j` of the list `a` to `False`. Given that `j` is 3, the element at index 3 of the list `a` will be updated from `True` to `False`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The initial state of `a` indicates it has 1,000,000 elements, all initially set to `True`, and specifically, the element at index 1 is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[3]` set to False; `i` is 2; `j` is 3; and `a[1]` is True.**
