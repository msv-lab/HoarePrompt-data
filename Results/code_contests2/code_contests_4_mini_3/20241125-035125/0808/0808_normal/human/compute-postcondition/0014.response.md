The value of `a[j]` is set to `False`, where `j` is 8. This changes the 9th element (index 8) of the list `a` from `True` to `False`. The values of `n`, `i`, and other elements of `a` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` has the 9th element set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is 8.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` has the 9th element set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is 8**.
