The code assigns the value `False` to `a[j]`, where `j` is 19. The previous state shows that `a[15]` is `False`, but the value of `a[19]` is not specified. Therefore, after executing this line, `a[19]` is set to `False`. The values of `n`, `a[2]`, `i`, and `a[15]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `a[2]` is True; `i` is 4; `j` is 19; `a[15]` is False; `a[19]` is False**
