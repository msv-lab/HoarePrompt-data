The variable `N` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input and returns it as a string. Since `N` is expected to be an integer within the range 1 to 100, it will be treated as such in the context of the program. The list `a` remains unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000**.
