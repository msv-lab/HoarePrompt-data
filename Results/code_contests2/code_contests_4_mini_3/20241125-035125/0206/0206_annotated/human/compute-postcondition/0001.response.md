The value of `a` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which takes input as a string, splits it by whitespace, and converts it into a list of strings. The previous state of `N` is unchanged, but `a` now holds the values from the input. Since `N` is an integer that indicates the number of elements, `a` will now contain `N` elements, but the specific integers are not defined without the input. Thus, the output state reflects that `a` now contains a list of strings based on the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` strings from input**
