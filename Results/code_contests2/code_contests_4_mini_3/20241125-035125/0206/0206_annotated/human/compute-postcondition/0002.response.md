To understand the impact of the code, we need to analyze the initial state and the operation performed by the code snippet.

1. The variable `a` is a list of `N` strings, where `N` is an integer between 1 and 100. The contents of `a` are not specified, but we know it contains string representations of some numerical values.
2. The code snippet calculates the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`, and then computes the absolute difference between them using `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))`.

Since `a` contains strings, the `np.max()` and `np.min()` functions will be invoked on these strings. The behavior of these functions on strings will depend on their lexicographical order rather than their numeric value.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `ans` is calculated based on the maximum and minimum of the list `a`, while `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` strings; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum of list `a` in lexicographical order.**
