Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum distance AtCoDeer must travel to deliver gifts to all houses. The problem states that he can start and end his travel at any positions, which implies he only needs to travel between the furthest houses. 

However, the code calculates the distance as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates of the houses, which is correct in terms of distance traveled between those two points. Yet, the code does not handle the case where the input might be given as strings (due to `raw_input()`), which would lead to the `np.max()` and `np.min()` functions not working as intended since they expect numeric values.

Moreover, the use of `np.abs()` suggests that NumPy is being used, but it's not clear if it's imported in the provided code, which would lead to a runtime error. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 3 7 9
```
The output should indeed be 7, since the distance from house at 2 to house at 9 is 7. However, given the misuses of input handling and reliance on NumPy without assurance of its import, there's room for failure in execution.

Thus, the program fails to guarantee correctness in all scenarios.
