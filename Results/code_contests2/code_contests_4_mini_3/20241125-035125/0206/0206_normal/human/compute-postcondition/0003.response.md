Since the code provided is a print statement, it will output the value of `ans` but will not change the state of any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of the variables along with the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings, `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum strings in `a`, and the function prints `ans`.**
