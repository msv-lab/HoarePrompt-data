The variable `a` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes input from the user as a string, splits it by whitespace, and returns a list of strings. The initial state indicates that `N` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of `N` integers. However, after the execution of the code snippet, `a` will no longer be a list of integers but instead a list of strings representing the input. The values of `N` and the integers in the original list `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of strings.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings**
