To simulate the execution of the provided code snippet, we need to analyze its impact on the variables given the initial state.

1. The variable `a` is a list of strings. The `np.max` and `np.min` functions from the NumPy library are typically used to find the maximum and minimum values in an array or list.
2. Since `a` is a list of strings, applying `np.max` and `np.min` will return the lexicographically largest and smallest strings, respectively.
3. The difference between the maximum and minimum strings (as returned by `np.max` and `np.min`) needs to be calculated.
4. The `np.abs` function will then take the absolute value of this difference. However, since string differences don't yield numeric results, the calculation will be based on the ordering of the strings and their respective values when compared.

Thus, the output will depend on the specific content of the list `a` and how those strings compare to each other lexicographically.

Therefore, the output state cannot be definitively stated without specific values in `a`. However, we can represent the situation generically:

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings, `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum strings in `a`**
