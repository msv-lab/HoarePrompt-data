The function accepts input from the user, where the first input is an integer N (which is not explicitly used in the code), and the second input is a list of N space-separated integers. It calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of this list and prints the result. However, there is no validation for the inputs, and the function assumes that the user will provide valid input according to the expected constraints.
