The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which converts the list or iterable `x` into a string and then into an integer. The value of `tem` is now determined by the specific value of `x`. The previous values of `ans`, `i`, and `n` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `tem` derived from `x`, while the values of `ans`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its original value and `tem`, `i` is at least 2, `tem` is the integer value derived from `''.join(x)`**
