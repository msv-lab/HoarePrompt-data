Postcondition: ***`ans` is the minimum of its original value and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which is greater than or equal to `n`. The variable `i` is at least 1, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`.***
