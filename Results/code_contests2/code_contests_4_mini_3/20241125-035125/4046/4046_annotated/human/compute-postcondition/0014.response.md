The code attempts to create a variable `tem` by joining elements of an iterable `x` and converting the resulting string to an integer. However, the variable `x` has not been defined in the given initial state, which means that the code will result in an error due to the undefined variable `x`. Thus, the output state would reflect that the code cannot be executed successfully because of this.

Output State: **The code cannot be executed successfully due to the undefined variable `x`.**
