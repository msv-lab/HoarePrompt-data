The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is a sequence of characters that will be joined into a single string and then converted to an integer. However, `x` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value or the resulting value of `tem`. The initial state only indicates that `i` has been incremented, but it does not affect `tem`.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is incremented but `x` is undefined, so we cannot determine the value of `tem`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented; `x` is undefined, so the value of `tem` cannot be determined.**
