Postcondition: ***`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. In cases where `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, if `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. The condition also ensures that `tem` is the integer formed by joining the elements of `x`.***
