Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even integer in {2, 4, 6, 8}, and `ans` is initially 4444477777. If `x` is a string of length `l` with equal counts of '7' and '4', then if `tem`, which is the integer value of `x`, is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n` or if the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are not equal, `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777.***
