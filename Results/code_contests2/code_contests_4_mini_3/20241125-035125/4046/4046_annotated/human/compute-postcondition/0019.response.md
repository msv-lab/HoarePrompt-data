The value of `tem` is assigned the result of `int(''.join(x))`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values of the other variables remain unchanged, and we cannot determine the value of `tem`. 

Thus, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even integer in {2, 4, 6, 8}; `ans` is 4444477777; `i` is incremented to the next value; but the value of `tem` cannot be determined as `x` is undefined.
