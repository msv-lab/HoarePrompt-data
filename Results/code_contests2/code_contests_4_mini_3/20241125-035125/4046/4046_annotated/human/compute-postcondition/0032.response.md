Postcondition: ***`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` if `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, and if `tem` (which is derived from `x` and equals 74747474747474747474) is greater than or equal to `n`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. If the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are not equal, `ans` remains unchanged. Additionally, `i` is 8, indicating that `x` is generated from the product of '74' repeated 8 times.***
