The variable `x` is a string generated by combining '7' and '4' of length `i`, where `i` is equal to `l` (an even integer), and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. Therefore, `x` consists of equal numbers of '7's and '4's. Since `l` can be 2, 4, 6, or 8, possible values of `x` could be '74', '7474', '747474', or '74747474'. 

The code converts `x` into an integer by joining its characters and then converting that string to an integer. Therefore, `tem` will be assigned the integer value of `x`.

Here are the transformations for possible values of `x`:
- If `l = 2`, `x` could be '74' → `tem` = 74
- If `l = 4`, `x` could be '7474' → `tem` = 7474
- If `l = 6`, `x` could be '747474' → `tem` = 747474
- If `l = 8`, `x` could be '74747474' → `tem` = 74747474

The output state will show the relationship between `n`, `l`, `ans`, `i`, `x`, and `tem`. Since the values of `n`, `ans`, and `i` are unchanged, the output state will reflect these along with the value of `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even integer in {2, 4, 6, 8}, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l`, `x` is a string of length `i` with equal counts of '7' and '4', and `tem` is either 74, 7474, 747474, or 74747474**
