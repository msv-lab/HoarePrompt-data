Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even integer in {2, 4, 6, 8}, and `ans` is initialized to 4444477777. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4', then `tem` is formed by joining the characters of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains 4444477777. The value of `i` is incremented to the next value, and the value of `tem` is dependent on the definition of `x`, which is not provided.***
