Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even integer in {2, 4, 6, 8}, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its original value and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777. `i` is equal to `l`, and `x` is a string of length `i` with equal counts of '7' and '4'.***
