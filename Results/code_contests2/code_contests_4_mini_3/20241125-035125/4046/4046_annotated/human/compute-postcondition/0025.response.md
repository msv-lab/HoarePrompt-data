According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the specified range. The loop starts at `l` and increments `i` by 2 each time until it reaches 10. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `i` was even and at least 2, the loop executed and updated `ans`. Since `i` increments by 2 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 10 after the current iteration.

If the last value of `i` was 8, then it would increment to 10, and the loop would not execute again. Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to a value that allows another iteration, specifically to 8, and `l` must also be adjusted to ensure that `i` can start from 8.

Assuming `l` was set correctly at the start, and given that `ans` has been updated based on valid conditions, I conclude:

State: **`ans` is updated based on the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `i` is 8, `l` is 8**
