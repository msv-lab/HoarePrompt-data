Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its original value and `tem` for valid strings `x` generated from the product of '74' repeated `i` times, where `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `l` is less than 2 or odd, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 4444477777. If there are no valid `x` that satisfy the condition, `ans` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `l` is greater than or equal to 10, the loop will terminate without executing, leaving `ans` as its initial value.**
