Postcondition: ***`i` has been incremented by 1. If the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x`, then `tem` is assigned the integer value formed by joining the elements of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If the counts are not equal, or if `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains undefined.***
