The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which converts the list of characters in `x` into a string and then to an integer. The previous values of `ans`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `tem`, with no changes to the other variables.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` if `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 9; `tem` is the integer formed by joining the elements of `x`.**
