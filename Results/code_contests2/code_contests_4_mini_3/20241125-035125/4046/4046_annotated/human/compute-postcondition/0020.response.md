The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. However, `tem` is undefined due to `x` being undefined, which means we cannot determine its value. As a result, the value of `ans` remains unchanged because `tem` cannot be evaluated. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even integer in {2, 4, 6, 8}; `ans` is 4444477777; `i` is incremented to the next value; `tem` cannot be determined as `x` is undefined.
