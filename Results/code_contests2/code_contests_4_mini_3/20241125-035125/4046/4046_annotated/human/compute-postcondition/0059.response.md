The value of `tem` is assigned the integer conversion of the string formed by joining the elements of `x`. The original value of `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, but since `ans`'s original value and `tem` are not specified, we can't determine exact values. The values of `n` and `i` are unaffected, and it is stated that `i` is at least 3. Therefore, the output state reflects the derived value of `tem` from `x`, while `ans` is noted to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its original value and `tem`, `tem` is the integer derived from `''.join(x)`, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is at least 3**
