Postcondition: ***`ans` is the minimum of its original value and `tem`, where `tem` is the integer value derived from `''.join(x)`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. Additionally, `i` is at least 2 throughout this process.***
