Postcondition: ***If `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, the integer `tem`, formed by joining the elements of `x`, is computed. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. If `x` does not contain an equal number of '7's and '4's, there is no change to `ans`.***
