The code attempts to compute the minimum value between `ans` and `tem` using the `min` function. However, the variable `x` is undefined in the initial state, which means that `ans` and `tem` cannot be evaluated. As a result, the operation cannot be performed, and there is no change to the state of the variables.

Output State: **The code cannot be executed successfully due to the undefined variable `x`.**
