The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The values of `ans` and `tem` depend on the previous state. Since `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the state of `ans` will be affected by the `min` function. However, without knowing the specific values of `ans` and `tem`, we can't specify the exact new value of `ans`. 

The output state would thus reflect the update to `ans` based on the minimum comparison. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`**
