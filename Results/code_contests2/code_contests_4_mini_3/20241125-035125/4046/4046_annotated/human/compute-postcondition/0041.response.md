Postcondition: ***`i` has been incremented, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its previous state and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains undefined. The exact values of `tem` and `ans` cannot be determined since they were both initially undefined.***
