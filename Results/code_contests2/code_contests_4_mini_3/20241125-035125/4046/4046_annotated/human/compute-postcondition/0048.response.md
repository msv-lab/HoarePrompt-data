The value of `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The variable `x` is assumed to be a string or a list of characters since `join` is used. The exact content of `x` is not provided, but it is known that the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x'. This condition does not directly affect the assignment of `tem`. 

Since `tem` is now an integer derived from `x`, it can potentially alter `ans` later on, but for this statement, we focus on the assignment of `tem`. The output state will reflect this assignment without knowing the actual value of `tem` since it depends on the specific content of `x`.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its original value and `tem`, `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is at least 1, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`.**
