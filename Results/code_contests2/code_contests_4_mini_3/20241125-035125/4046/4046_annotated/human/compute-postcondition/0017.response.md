Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even integer in {2, 4, 6, 8}, `ans` is initially 4444477777, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `x` is defined such that the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4', then `tem` is calculated as the integer value of the string formed by the characters in `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. If the condition regarding the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` is not met, no changes occur to `ans`. Additionally, if `x` is undefined, the program cannot execute the inner logic.***
