To analyze the output state after the loop executes, we first need to identify the loop's functionality and the potential edge cases involved. 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even integer in {2, 4, 6, 8}, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l`.

The loop is designed to generate strings of length `i` consisting of the characters '7' and '4', and it checks if these strings have an equal count of '7's and '4's. If such a string (denoted as `x`) is formed, it converts `x` into an integer `tem` and compares it with `n`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`.

### Edge Cases and Missing Logic:

1. **Loop Execution**: The loop will execute only if `i` is set to a valid value (which it is, as `i = l`). If `i` were to be set to a value less than 2, the loop would not execute, resulting in `ans` remaining unchanged at 4444477777.

2. **Count of Digits**: The loop checks strings where the count of '7's equals the count of '4's. If `i` is odd, it is impossible to have equal counts of '7' and '4', causing the loop to not execute any valid iterations.

3. **Value of `tem`**: The value of `tem` is influenced by the generated strings. If no valid string with equal counts of '7's and '4's is found that meets the condition `tem >= n`, `ans` would remain unchanged.

### Output State Analysis:

- If `i` is equal to 2, the possible strings generated are "74", "47". If `tem` for either of these is less than `n`, `ans` remains 4444477777.
- If `i` is equal to 4, the possible valid strings could be "7774", "7747", "7477", "4777", "4477", etc., and `tem` will be checked against `n`.
- If `i` is equal to 6 or 8, similarly, more combinations will be formed, but they still need to satisfy the count condition and the comparison with `n`.

### Conclusion:

Thus, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **If `i` is even and at least 2, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` for valid strings `x` where the count of '7' equals the count of '4' and `tem >= n`. If `i` is less than 2 or odd, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 4444477777.**
