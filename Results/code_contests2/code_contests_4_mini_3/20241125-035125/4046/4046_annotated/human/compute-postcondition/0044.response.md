Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its original value and `tem` for all valid `x` generated from the product of '74' repeated `i` times, where `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If there are no valid `x` that meet these criteria, `ans` remains unchanged. If `i` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains at its initial value.**
