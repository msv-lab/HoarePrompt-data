Postcondition: ***`ans` is the minimum of its original value and `tem` if the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x` and `tem`, which is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, is greater than or equal to `n`. If the counts are equal but `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. If the counts are not equal, `ans` remains unchanged. The variable `i` is at least 1, and `tem` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `n` when the counts are equal.***
