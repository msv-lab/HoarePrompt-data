The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` is an odd integer, the new value of `l` will be an even integer. The variables `n` and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even integer; `ans` is 4444477777.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even integer; `ans` is 4444477777**
