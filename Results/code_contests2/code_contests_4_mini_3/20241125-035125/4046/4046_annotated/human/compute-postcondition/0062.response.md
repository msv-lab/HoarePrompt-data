Postcondition: ***`ans` is the minimum of its original value and `tem` if the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to this minimum value; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The value of `tem` is derived from `''.join(x)`, `n` remains unchanged, and `i` is at least 3. Additionally, if the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are not equal, no changes are made to `ans`, `tem`, or `n`.***
