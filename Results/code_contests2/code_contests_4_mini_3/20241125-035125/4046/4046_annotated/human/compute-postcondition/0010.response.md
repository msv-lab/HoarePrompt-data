The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Since `ans` is initially 4444477777 and `tem` can be one of the values {74, 7474, 747474, 74747474}, and it is known that `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, which means `tem` will always be less than or equal to 4444477777 as `n` is a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be `tem`, which is the minimum value among the options provided.

Given that `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` will be updated to the lesser of 4444477777 and `tem`. Since `tem` is less than or equal to 4444477777, the output state will reflect that `ans` has been updated to `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even integer in {2, 4, 6, 8}, `ans` is `tem`, `i` is `l`, `x` is a string of length `i` with equal counts of '7' and '4', and `tem` is either 74, 7474, 747474, or 74747474.**
