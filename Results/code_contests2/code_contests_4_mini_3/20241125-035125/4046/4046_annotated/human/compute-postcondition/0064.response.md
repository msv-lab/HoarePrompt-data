Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its original value and `tem`, where `tem` is derived from `x` if `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If no valid `x` satisfies the condition of having equal counts of '7's and '4's or if all valid `tem` values are less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. The variable `i` is between 1 and 9, and if `i` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, leaving `ans` as its original value.**
