The value of `ans` is updated based on the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Since `tem` is 74747474747474747474 and is greater than or equal to `n`, the minimum function will compare `ans` with `tem` and assign the smaller of the two to `ans`. The specific new value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing its initial value. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is updated based on the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `i` is 8, `tem` is 74747474747474747474.

Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `i` is 8, `tem` is 74747474747474747474**
