Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even integer in {2, 4, 6, 8}; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` remains 4444477777. The value of `i` is incremented to the next value, and the value of `tem` cannot be determined as `x` is undefined.***
