The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which converts the list `x` into a string and then into an integer. The variable `x` is the first combination generated by the product of '74' repeated 8 times, meaning `x` is a string that consists of '74' repeated 8 times, resulting in the string '74747474747474747474'. The value of `tem` will be the integer representation of this string.

Calculating the value:
- `x` = '74747474747474747474'
- `tem` = int('74747474747474747474') = 74747474747474747474

Since `ans` is updated based on the minimum of its current value and `tem`, but we do not have the initial value of `ans`, we cannot determine its final state. However, we can report the value of `tem`.

The output state is:
- `tem` is 74747474747474747474
- Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `i` is 8, `tem` is 74747474747474747474**
