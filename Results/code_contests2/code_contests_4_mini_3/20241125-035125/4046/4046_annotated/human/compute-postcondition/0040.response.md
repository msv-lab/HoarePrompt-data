The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. However, since `tem` is undefined, we cannot determine its value, which affects the output. The value of `ans` is also undefined as the variable `ans` has not been specified. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is undefined and `tem` is also undefined.

Output State: **`ans` is undefined, `tem` is undefined**
