According to the code, the loop iterates over all combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`. The loop can execute again if there is another combination available. Currently, `i` is 8, meaning the loop has generated combinations of length 8.

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777, and `i` remains 8. The loop will execute one more time for `x` to generate the next combination of '7's and '4's of length 8. Since the current iteration has completed, the next value of `x` will be the next combination in the sequence.

The count of '7's and '4's in `x` will still be balanced as per the conditions in the problem statement. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are simply that `x` should represent the next combination of '7's and '4's of length 8.

State: **`ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777, i is 8, x is the next combination of '7's and '4's of length 8**
