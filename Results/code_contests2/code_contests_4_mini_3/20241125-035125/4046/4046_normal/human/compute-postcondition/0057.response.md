Postcondition: ***`ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777. If `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, `tem` is calculated as an integer from `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. Therefore, if the condition regarding the counts of '7's and '4's holds, `ans` may be updated, but if not, it remains less than or equal to 4444477777 and unchanged.***
