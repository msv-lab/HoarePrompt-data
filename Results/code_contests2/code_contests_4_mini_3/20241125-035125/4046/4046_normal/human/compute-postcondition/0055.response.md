The variable `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Since `tem` is formed by a combination of '7's and '4's of length 8, its value is specific, but we only know that `ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777. The exact value of `tem` is not specified, but it is known to be an integer. 

If `tem` is less than `ans`, `ans` would be updated to `tem`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. Thus, we can conclude that the output state will reflect the possible values of `ans` considering the comparison with `tem`.

Output State: **`ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777; `i` is 8; `x` is the next combination of '7's and '4's of length 8; `tem` is an integer formed by that combination; `ans` is updated to min(ans, tem)**.
