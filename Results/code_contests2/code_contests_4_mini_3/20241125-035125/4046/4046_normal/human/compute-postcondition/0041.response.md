Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 10, and `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest integer formed by a balanced combination of '7's and '4's of length `l` that is greater than or equal to `n`. If `tem`, an integer formed by `int(''.join(x))`, is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged and `i` is still incremented by 1.***
