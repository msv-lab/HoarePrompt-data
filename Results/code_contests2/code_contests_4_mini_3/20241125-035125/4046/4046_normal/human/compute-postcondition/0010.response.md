The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The initial state shows that `ans` is 4444477777, and `tem` is a value derived from `x` that is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. Since `tem` is not specified but is greater than or equal to `n`, it is likely to be a large value. Hence, we compare `ans` and `tem` to determine the new value of `ans`.

Assuming `tem` is less than `ans`, `ans` would be updated to `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. Since we do not know the specific value of `tem`, we cannot definitively state the new value of `ans`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is 8 or 9; `ans` is either 4444477777 or `tem`; `i` is 8 or 9; the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`; `tem` is the integer value of `x` joined as a string; and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is 8 or 9; `ans` is either 4444477777 or `tem`; `i` is 8 or 9; the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`; `tem` is the integer value of `x` joined as a string; and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
