The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the output state will reflect that `n` is now the value provided by the input. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
