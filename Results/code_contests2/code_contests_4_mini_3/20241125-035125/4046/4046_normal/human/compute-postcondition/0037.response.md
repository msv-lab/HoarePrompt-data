Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 10, and `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest integer formed by a balanced combination of '7's and '4's of length `l` that is greater than or equal to `n`. If the string `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, and if the integer `tem` formed by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. If `x` does not contain an equal number of '7's and '4's, `ans` is unchanged.***
