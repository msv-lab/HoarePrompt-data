Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is 8 or 9; `ans` remains 4444477777. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then `tem`, the integer value of `x` joined as a string, is compared with `n`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its initial value (4444477777) and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. If the count of '7' in `x` does not equal the count of '4' in `x`, `ans` remains as 4444477777.***
