The code assigns `ans` the value of the minimum between `ans` and `tem`. Since `tem` cannot be determined due to the absence of `x`, we cannot compute its value. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is either 9 or 10; `ans` is 4444477777; `i` is 9; `tem` cannot be determined**
