The code attempts to assign the minimum value between `ans` and `tem` to `ans`. However, since `tem` is an undefined variable, an error occurs. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is 9 or 10; `ans` remains 4444477777; `i` is 9, and an error occurs due to the undefined variable `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is 9 or 10; `ans` remains 4444477777; `i` is 9, and an error occurs due to the undefined variable `tem.**
