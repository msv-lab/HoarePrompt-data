The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Since `ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777 and `tem` is assigned a value from `int(''.join(x))`, the exact value of `tem` is not specified, but it is a valid integer. Therefore, `ans` may either remain the same or take the value of `tem` depending on the comparison.

Thus, the output state is: `ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777, `i` is one greater than its previous value, and `tem` is assigned the value of int(''.join(x)). The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.

Output State: **`ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777, `i` is one greater than its previous value, `tem` is assigned the value of int(''.join(x)), and `ans` is updated to min(ans, tem)**
