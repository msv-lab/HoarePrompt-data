The code assigns `tem` the value of `int(''.join(x))`. Here, `x` is the next combination of '7's and '4's of length 8. The exact content of `x` is not specified in the initial state, but it will be a valid string of characters '7' and '4'. The `join` method concatenates the characters in `x` into a single string, and `int` converts that string to an integer.

Since `ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777, `tem` will also hold a value that is a valid integer representation of the combination in `x`. However, without knowing the exact combination of '7's and '4's in `x`, we cannot state the precise value of `tem`.

Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777, `i` is 8, `x` is the next combination of '7's and '4's of length 8, and `tem` is an integer formed by that combination.

Output State: **`ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777, `i` is 8, `x` is the next combination of '7's and '4's of length 8, and `tem` is an integer formed by that combination.**
