According to the code, the loop will execute for the values generated by `product('74', repeat=i)`, where `i` is currently 9. This means the loop generates combinations of '7's and '4's with a length of 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9, which indicates that the loop has exhausted all combinations for this value of `i`. 

In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be incremented to 10, allowing it to generate new combinations with a length of 10. The states regarding `n`, `l`, and `ans` do not need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop execution directly. 

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which must be changed to 10.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is either 9 or 10; `ans` remains 4444477777; `i` is 10.**
