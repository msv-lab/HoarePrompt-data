The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine what `''.join(x)` evaluates to. Consequently, the value of `tem` is also unknown. The variables `n`, `l`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the known values and the assignment operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 10, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest integer formed by a balanced combination of '7's and '4's of length `l` that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `tem` is an integer formed by `int(''.join(x))`.**
