Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 10, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest integer formed by a balanced combination of '7's and '4's of length `l` that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 1. If `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, and `tem` is the integer formed by joining `x`, then if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, or if `x` does not contain an equal number of '7's and '4's, `ans` remains unchanged.***
