Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest integer formed by a balanced combination of '7's and '4's of length `l` (where `l` is less than or equal to 8). If `l` is 0 or if there are no balanced combinations of '7's and '4's for the specified length, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains as the initial minimum value 4444477777. If `l` is at least 1, then the loop executes for all permutations of '7's and '4's of length `i`, but only updates `ans` when a valid balanced number is found that is greater than or equal to `n`. If no such number is found, `ans` remains unchanged.**
