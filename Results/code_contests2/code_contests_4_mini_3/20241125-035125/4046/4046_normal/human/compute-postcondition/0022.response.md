Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is either 9 or 10; `ans` remains 4444477777; `i` is 9. If the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, then `tem` is formed by joining the elements of `x` and converting them to an integer. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If the count of '7's is not equal to the count of '4's, or if `tem` is less than `n`, then `ans` remains unchanged at 4444477777.***
