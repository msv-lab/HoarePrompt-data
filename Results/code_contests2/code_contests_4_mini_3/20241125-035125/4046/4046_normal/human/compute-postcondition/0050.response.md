The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Given that `tem` is 44447777 and `ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777, the minimum value will be `ans` itself, as `tem` is greater than `ans`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777, `tem` is 44447777, `i` is 8, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777, `tem` is 44447777, `i` is 8, and `ans` remains unchanged**
