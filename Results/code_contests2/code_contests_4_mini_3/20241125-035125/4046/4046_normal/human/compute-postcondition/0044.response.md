Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest integer formed by a balanced combination of '7's and '4's of length `l` that is greater than or equal to `n`, provided the loop executes. If `l` is less than 2, the loop will not execute, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than the largest possible balanced integer formed by '7's and '4's of length `l` (which is 4444477777 for `l` = 10), the loop may not find a valid `tem` and thus `ans` remains unchanged. If `n` is such that no valid balanced combination can be formed, then `ans` also remains unchanged.**
