The code snippet attempts to create a string by joining the elements of the iterable `x`, which is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the assignment to `tem` cannot be completed, and it will result in an error due to the undefined variable `x`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is 9 or 10; `ans` remains 4444477777; `i` is 9, and an error occurs due to the undefined variable `x`.**
