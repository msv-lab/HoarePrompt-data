The code snippet assigns a value to `tem` by converting the string `x` into an integer after joining its characters. The value of `x` is not defined in the initial state, but it is implied that the count of '7' equals the count of '4'. However, since we do not have the explicit value of `x`, we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. Other variables (`n`, `l`, `ans`, `i`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is 8 or 9; `ans` remains 4444477777; `i` is 8 or 9; and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is set to the integer value of `x` joined as a string, which is unknown.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is 8 or 9; `ans` remains 4444477777; `i` is 8 or 9; and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`; `tem` is the integer value of `x` joined as a string (unknown)**.
