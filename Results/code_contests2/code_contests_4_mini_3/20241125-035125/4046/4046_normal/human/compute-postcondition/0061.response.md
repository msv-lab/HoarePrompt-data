Postcondition: ***`ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. Additionally, `i` is one greater than its previous value, and `tem` is assigned the value of int(''.join(x)).***
