To evaluate the effect of the provided code snippet, we need to consider the initial state of the variables.

1. The variable `ans` is initially defined as the minimum of `4444477777` and the smallest integer formed by a balanced combination of '7's and '4's of length `l` (which is `10`) that is greater than or equal to `n`.
2. The variable `tem` is defined as an integer formed by `int(''.join(x))`, but we do not have information about `x`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`.
3. The code then updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`.

Since we do not have the specific value of `tem`, we can only state that `ans` will change based on the comparison of its current value and `tem`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ans` has been potentially updated based on the value of `tem`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 10, `ans` is updated to min(ans, tem), `i` is incremented by 1, and `tem` is an integer formed by int(''.join(x)).**
