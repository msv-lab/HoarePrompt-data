The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which means that `x` is a list of strings that is being concatenated into a single string and then converted into an integer. The exact value of `tem` cannot be determined without knowing the content of `x`, but since `ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777, we can infer that `tem` could potentially also be a number less than or equal to this limit if `x` contains valid digits.

The variable `i` is one greater than its previous value, but since the previous value is unknown, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.

Since the state of the other variables is not affected by this line, the output state remains unspecified for `tem` but acknowledges the change in `i`.

Output State: **`ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777, `i` is one greater than its previous value, and `tem` is assigned the value of int(''.join(x))**
