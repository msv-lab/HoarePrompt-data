`l` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `l` is an odd integer, so after execution, `l` becomes an even integer. The values of `n` and `ans` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even integer; `ans` is 4444477777.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even integer; `ans` is 4444477777**
