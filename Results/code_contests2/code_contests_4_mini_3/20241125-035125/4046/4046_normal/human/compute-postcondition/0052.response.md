Postcondition: ***`ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777. If the count of '7's and '4's in `x` is equal, `tem` is calculated as the integer formed by `x`. If `tem` (which is a balanced number like 44447777) is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` remains unchanged and is still less than or equal to 4444477777. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` also remains unchanged. The value of `i` remains 8, and `tem` retains its value as the integer formed by the balanced combination of '7's and '4's. If the count of '7's and '4's in `x` is not equal, no changes are made to `ans` or `tem`.***
