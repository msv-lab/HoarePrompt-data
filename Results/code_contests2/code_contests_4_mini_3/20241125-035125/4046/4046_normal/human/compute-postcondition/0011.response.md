Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is 8 or 9; `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its initial value (4444477777) and `tem` if `tem` (the integer value of `x` joined as a string, where the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`) is greater than or equal to `n`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged.***
