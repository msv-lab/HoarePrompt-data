The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Since `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, the specific value of `tem` is unknown as `x` is not defined. However, `ans` is initially set to be the minimum of 4444477777 and a certain integer formed by '7's and '4's of length `l` (which is 10) and must be greater than or equal to `n`.

The output state does not change the values of `n`, `l`, or `i`. The variable `ans` may change based on the comparison between its current value and `tem`, but we can't determine the exact new value of `ans` without knowing `tem`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 10, `ans` is the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is 2, and `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is unknown.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 10, `ans` is the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is 2, and `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is unknown.**
