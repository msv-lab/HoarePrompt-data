The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The value of `x` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is stated that `x` is a balanced combination of '7's and '4's of length 8, meaning `x` could be something like "44447777" or "77774444", and it must satisfy the condition of having equal counts of '4's and '7's. Thus, `x` can be considered as a string made of 4 '4's and 4 '7's.

The smallest integer formed by such a balanced combination would be "44447777". When this string is joined and converted to an integer, it results in the integer value `44447777`.

Since the assignment of `tem` does not affect any other variables, the output state is: `ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777, the smallest integer formed by a balanced combination of '7's and '4's of length 8 is 44447777, `i` is 8, and `tem` is 44447777.

Output State: **`ans` is less than or equal to 4444477777, the smallest integer formed by a balanced combination of '7's and '4's of length 8 is 44447777, `i` is 8, and `tem` is 44447777**.
