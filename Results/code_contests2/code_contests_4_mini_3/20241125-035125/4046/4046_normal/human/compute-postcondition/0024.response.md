Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is 8 or 9; `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest integer formed by a balanced combination of '7's and '4's of length `l` that is greater than or equal to `n`. If `l` is less than 8, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 4444477777. If `l` is 8 or 9, the loop executes and checks all combinations of '7's and '4's, updating `ans` only if a valid `tem` is found. If no valid `tem` is found that meets the criteria, `ans` remains unchanged.**
