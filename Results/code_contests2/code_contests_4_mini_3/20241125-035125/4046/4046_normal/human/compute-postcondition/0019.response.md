The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `x`, which is necessary to compute `tem`. Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific value for `tem`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `tem` cannot be determined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is either 9 or 10; `ans` remains 4444477777; `i` is 9, and `tem` cannot be determined due to the absence of `x`.**
