The variable `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's. Given that `l` is 10, this means `x` can be represented as a string of 5 '7's and 5 '4's in some order. When the code concatenates `x` and converts it to an integer, the exact integer value of `tem` will depend on the specific arrangement of the '7's and '4's in `x`. However, since `x` is formed by a balanced combination of '7's and '4's, the minimum integer value of `tem` will be the smallest arrangement, which is '4444477777'.

Thus, `tem` is assigned the value of `int('4444477777')`, which equals 4444477777.

The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 10, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest integer formed by a balanced combination of '7's and '4's of length `l` that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, and `tem` is 4444477777**.
