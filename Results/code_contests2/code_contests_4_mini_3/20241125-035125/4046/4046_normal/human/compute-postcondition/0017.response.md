Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is either 9 or 10; `ans` remains 4444477777; `i` is 9. If the count of '7's in `x` equals the count of '4's in `x`, then `tem` is defined as the integer formed by the digits in `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If the counts of '7's and '4's are not equal, `ans` remains unchanged. Note that if `tem` is undefined due to the condition not being met, an error occurs, but this situation does not affect the final state of `ans`.***
