The function accepts no parameters, reads a positive integer `n` from input, and finds the smallest integer composed of equal numbers of the digits '7' and '4' that has a length greater than or equal to the number of digits in `n`, and is also greater than or equal to `n`. If no such number exists, it defaults to returning 4444477777. If `n` has fewer than 8 digits, it returns 4444477777 since no valid balanced combinations can be formed.
