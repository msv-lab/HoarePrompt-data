To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code against the problem description.

The task is to find the minimum perimeter that can enclose exactly N city blocks laid out in a square grid. 

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of city blocks.

2. **Calculating the Square Root:**
   - The program calculates `x`, the integer square root of `n` using `int(n ** 0.5)`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - If `x * x == n`, this means `n` is a perfect square. The perimeter for a square of area `n` is `x * 4`.
   - If `x * (x + 1) > n`, this condition checks if the rectangular arrangement of blocks formed by `x` and `x + 1` exceeds `n`. In this case, the perimeter is calculated as `(x + x + 1) * 2`, which simplifies to `4 * x + 2`.
   - If neither condition is true, then `n` is between `x * x` and `x * (x + 1)`, and the perimeter is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`.

### Edge Cases:

Let's consider a few edge cases:
1. **Case when N = 1:**
   - Expected output: 4 (a single block forms a square with perimeter 4).
   - The program calculates `x = 1`. Since `1 * 1 == 1`, it outputs `1 * 4 = 4`. Correct.

2. **Case when N = 2:**
   - Expected output: 6 (a 1x2 rectangle has a perimeter of 6).
   - The program calculates `x = 1`. It checks `1 * (1 + 1)` which equals `2`. Since this condition is not greater, it falls to the else statement, giving `4 * (1 + 1) = 8`. Incorrect output.

3. **Case when N = 3:**
   - Expected output: 8 (a 1x3 rectangle has a perimeter of 8).
   - The program calculates `x = 1`. It checks `1 * (1 + 1)` which equals `2`. Since this condition is not greater, it will again give `4 * (1 + 1) = 8`. Correct.

4. **Case when N = 5:**
   - Expected output: 12 (a 2x3 rectangle has a perimeter of 12).
   - The program calculates `x = 2`. It checks `2 * (2 + 1)` which equals `6`. Since this condition is not greater, it gives `4 * (2 + 1) = 12`. Correct.

5. **Case when N = 6:**
   - Expected output: 12 (a 2x3 rectangle has a perimeter of 12).
   - The program calculates `x = 2`. It checks `2 * (2 + 1)` which equals `6`. It falls to the else statement giving `4 * (2 + 1) = 12`. Correct.

6. **Case when N = 7:**
   - Expected output: 14 (a 2x4 rectangle has a perimeter of 14).
   - The program calculates `x = 2`. It checks `2 * (2 + 1)` which equals `6`. Since this condition is not greater, it falls to the else statement giving `4 * (2 + 1) = 12`. Incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle cases where N is not a perfect square and does not yield the correct minimum perimeter for various configurations of N. Specifically, it fails for N = 2, N = 7, etc.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program has logical errors that cause it to return incorrect perimeter values for certain inputs, specifically for N = 2 and N = 7.
