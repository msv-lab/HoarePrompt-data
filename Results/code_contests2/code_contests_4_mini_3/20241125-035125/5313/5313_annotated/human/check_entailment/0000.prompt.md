You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Your security guard friend recently got a new job at a new security company. The company requires him to patrol an area of the city encompassing exactly N city blocks, but they let him choose which blocks. That is, your friend must walk the perimeter of a region whose area is exactly N blocks. Your friend is quite lazy and would like your help to find the shortest possible route that meets the requirements. The city is laid out in a square grid pattern, and is large enough that for the sake of the problem it can be considered infinite.

Input

Input will consist of a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 106), the number of city blocks that must be enclosed by the route.

Output

Print the minimum perimeter that can be achieved.

Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = int(n ** 0.5)
    if (x ** 2 == n) :
        answr = x * 4
    else :
        if (x * (x + 1) > n) :
            answr = (x + x + 1) * 2
        else :
            answr = 4 * (x + 1)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, then `answr` is calculated as `4x + 2`. Otherwise, `answr` is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`. This ensures that `answr` reflects the relationship between `n` and the integer square root `x`, covering the boundary where `x * (x + 1)` equals `n`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`. If `x` squared is equal to `n`, then `answr` is equal to `x * 4`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, then `answr` is calculated as `4 * x + 2`. Otherwise, `answr` is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`, ensuring that all relationships between `n` and its integer square root `x` are appropriately handled, including the boundary case where `x * (x + 1)` equals `n`.
    answr = int(answr)
    print(answr)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
