The code snippet converts the variable `answr` to an integer type using `int()`. The previous value of `answr` is not directly provided, but it was calculated based on the conditions related to `n` and `x`. The conversion to integer ensures that if `answr` was previously a float or had decimal values, it will now be represented as an integer. 

However, since the specific value of `answr` before the conversion is not given, the output state reflects the conversion without affecting the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is converted to an integer.**
