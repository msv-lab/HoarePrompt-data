The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `N` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the assignment to `n`. The output state depends on the value entered for `n`, which is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer**
