Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`. If `x` squared is equal to `n`, then `answr` is equal to `x * 4`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, then `answr` is calculated as `4 * x + 2`. Otherwise, `answr` is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`, ensuring that all relationships between `n` and its integer square root `x` are appropriately handled, including the boundary case where `x * (x + 1)` equals `n`.***
