The variable `answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`. The value of `x` is already defined as the integer square root of `n`, and it holds that `x * (x + 1)` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the calculation for `answr` will depend on the specific value of `x`. 

Since `x` is known from the initial state, `answr` will be computed based on that value. Consequently, the output state will reflect the values of `N`, `n`, `x`, and the newly calculated `answr`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is 4 * (x + 1)**
