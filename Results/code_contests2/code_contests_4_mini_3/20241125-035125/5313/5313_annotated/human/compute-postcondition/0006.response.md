The variable `answr` is calculated as `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Given that `x` is the integer square root of `n`, we can express `answr` in terms of `x` as `answr = (2x + 1) * 2 = 4x + 2`. The specific value of `answr` depends on the value of `x`, which is derived from `n`.

Since `n` is an input integer and `x` is determined by `n`, the output state will reflect that the value of `answr` is calculated based on `x`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; and `answr` is calculated as `4x + 2`.**
