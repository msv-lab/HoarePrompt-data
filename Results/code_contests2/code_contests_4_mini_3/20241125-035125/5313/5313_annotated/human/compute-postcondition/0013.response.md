The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on a predefined positive integer `N`, where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6`. However, since there are no specific outputs or return values provided in the output section, it cannot be determined what the function returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` cannot be clearly defined without additional information on its output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is not specified.**
