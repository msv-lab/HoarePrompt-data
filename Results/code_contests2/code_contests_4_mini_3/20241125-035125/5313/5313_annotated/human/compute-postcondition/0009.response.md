Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, then `answr` is calculated as `4x + 2`. Otherwise, `answr` is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`. This ensures that `answr` reflects the relationship between `n` and the integer square root `x`, covering the boundary where `x * (x + 1)` equals `n`.***
