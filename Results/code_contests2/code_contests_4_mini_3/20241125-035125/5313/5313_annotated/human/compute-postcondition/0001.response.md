The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, which calculates the integer square root of `n`. Since `n` is an input integer, its value is known but not specified. Thus, the output state will reflect that `x` is now equal to the integer square root of `n`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`**
