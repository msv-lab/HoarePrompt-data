The function accepts an integer input `n`, calculates its integer square root `x`, and then determines a value `answr` based on the relationship between `n` and `x`. If `n` is a perfect square, it returns `4 * x`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, it returns `4 * x + 2`. Otherwise, it returns `4 * (x + 1)`. The function does not return a value explicitly; instead, it prints the result to the console. It also does not handle cases where the input is less than 1, as it assumes `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^6.
