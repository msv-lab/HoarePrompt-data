To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

The problem requires us to find the minimum perimeter of a shape that encloses exactly N city blocks. The program calculates potential values based on the square root of N and checks for certain conditions to decide the perimeter.

Let's break down the program:

1. It computes the integer square root `x` of `n`.
2. It checks if `x ** 2` is equal to `n`, which would mean that `n` is a perfect square. In this case, the perimeter is `4 * x`.
3. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, it calculates the perimeter as `(x + x + 1) * 2`.
4. If neither of the above conditions is true, it computes the perimeter as `4 * (x + 1)`.

Now let's analyze the correctness:

- For `N = 1`, the output should be `4`, which is correctly computed as `answr` will be `4 * 1`.
- For `N = 2`, the perimeter should be `6`, but the program doesn't handle this explicitly.
- For `N = 3`, the perimeter should also be `6`, but again, the program does not address this case.
- For `N = 4`, the program correctly outputs `8`.
- For `N = 11`, the program outputs `14`, which is correct.
- For `N = 22`, the program outputs `20`, which is also correct.

The issue arises because the program fails to handle cases like `N = 2` and `N = 3`, which would give incorrect results. It skips to calculations that do not cover all necessary cases for the minimum perimeters.

Due to the failures in handling certain cases, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
