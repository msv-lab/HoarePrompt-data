The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`. The expression simplifies to `(2x + 1) * 2`, which results in `4x + 2`. Given that `x` is the square root of `n` and satisfies the condition that `x * (x + 1) > n`, we can compute `answr` based on the value of `x`. 

Since `N` is a positive integer within the range, `n` must also fall within this range. Therefore, the output state will depend on the specific values of `n` and consequently `x`. However, since the specific values are not provided, we can only describe the relationship.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is an integer such that x is the square root of `n` and x * (x + 1) is greater than `n`; `answr` is (2 * x + 1) * 2 = 4x + 2**
