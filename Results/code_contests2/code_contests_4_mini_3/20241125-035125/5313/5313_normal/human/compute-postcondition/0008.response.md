The variable `answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`. The value of `x` is the integer square root of `n`, and since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^6, `x` will also fall within a corresponding range. The specific values of `n` and `x` are not provided, but we know that `x * (x + 1) ≤ n`. Therefore, `answr` will be calculated based on the value of `x`.

Since `x` can vary depending on the value of `n`, the output will specify the relationship of `answr` to `x`. Thus we can state that `answr` is equal to `4 * (x + 1)`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is an integer square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * (x + 1)`**
