Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an integer within the same range; `x` is the integer square root of `n`. If `x ** 2` equals `n`, then `answr` is `4 * x`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, then `answr` is `4 * x + 2`. Otherwise, `answr` is `4 * (x + 1)`. This ensures that all cases where `n` is within the specified range are handled, including boundary cases where `n` is 1 (the minimum) or 10^6 (the maximum).***
