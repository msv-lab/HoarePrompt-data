Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an integer within the same range; `x` is the integer square root of `n`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, then `answr` is equal to `4x + 2`. Otherwise, `answr` is equal to `4 * (x + 1)`. This ensures that all cases where `n` is in the specified range and `x` is correctly computed are addressed, including the boundary cases where `n` is at its minimum or maximum values.***
