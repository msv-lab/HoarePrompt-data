The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, which is the integer square root of `n`. The value of `n` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 10^6. Therefore, `x` will hold the integer part of the square root of `n`. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer square root of `n`**
