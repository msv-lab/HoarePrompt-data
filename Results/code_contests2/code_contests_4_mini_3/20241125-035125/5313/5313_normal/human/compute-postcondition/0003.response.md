The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Since `x` is the integer square root of `n`, the value of `answr` will be four times the integer square root of `n`. The previous values of the affected variables are not given, but we know that `N` is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 10^6, and `n` is also an input integer within the same range. Therefore, `answr` will depend on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is `x * 4`.**
