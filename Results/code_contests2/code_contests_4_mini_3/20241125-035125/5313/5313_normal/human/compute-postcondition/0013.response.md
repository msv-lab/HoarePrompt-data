The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate based on the internal logic defined within the function body. Given the constraints, the function is expected to handle a positive integer `N`, where \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^6 \). However, without specific details on the output behavior of the function, we cannot detail the return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function is simply to operate based on the internal logic that presumably relates to the positive integer `N`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on an internal logic that likely involves a positive integer N, although the specific return value is not defined.**
