The function accepts an integer input from the user, calculates the integer square root of that input, and determines an output value based on whether the input is a perfect square or lies between certain thresholds. It prints the computed value which is derived from the conditions involving the square root of the input, but does not return any value explicitly. The function does not handle invalid inputs (like non-integer values) or inputs outside the specified range (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6) explicitly, which could result in runtime errors.
