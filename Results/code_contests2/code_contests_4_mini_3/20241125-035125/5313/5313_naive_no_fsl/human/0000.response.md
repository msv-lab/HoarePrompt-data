To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and see if it correctly calculates the minimum perimeter for a given area \( N \).

The program follows these steps:

1. It reads an integer \( n \) which represents the area of city blocks.
2. It calculates the integer square root \( x \) of \( n \).
3. It checks if \( n \) is a perfect square:
   - If \( n \) is a perfect square, it calculates the perimeter as \( 4 \times x \).
4. It checks if the area can be enclosed in a rectangle:
   - If \( x \times (x + 1) \) is greater than \( n \), it calculates the perimeter as \( 2 \times (x + x + 1) \).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the perimeter as \( 4 \times (x + 1) \).
5. Finally, it prints the calculated perimeter.

### Analysis of Logic

1. **Perfect Square Check**:
   - For perfect squares, the perimeter should be \( 4 \times \text{side} \). This part seems correct.

2. **Rectangle Enclosure Check**:
   - The logic for determining whether we can fit the area into a rectangle is a bit unclear. The condition \( x \times (x + 1) > n \) is meant to handle cases where the area cannot form a rectangle with width \( x \) and height \( x + 1 \). However, it does not account for all potential configurations that could yield a minimum perimeter.

3. **General Cases**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle cases where the area \( n \) can be enclosed in a rectangle that is not a perfect square or the immediate next rectangle. For example:
     - For \( n = 3 \): The minimum perimeter should be 8 (forming a 1x3 rectangle) but the program incorrectly calculates it.
     - For \( n = 2 \): The minimum perimeter should also be 8 (forming a 1x2 rectangle), whereas the program does not account for this correctly.

### Conclusion

The program fails to calculate the minimum perimeter correctly for certain values of \( n \) like \( 2 \) and \( 3 \). Therefore, it does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
