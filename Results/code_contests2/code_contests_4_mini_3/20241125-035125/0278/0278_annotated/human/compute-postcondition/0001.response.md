The code reads two lines of input, each containing space-separated values. The first line of input is processed into a list of floats assigned to `a`, and the second line is processed into a list of floats assigned to `b`. Since the specific values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only determine that both `a` and `b` will now hold lists of floating-point numbers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20; `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `V` ≤ 10000; `a` is a list of floats from the first input; `b` is a list of floats from the second input.**
