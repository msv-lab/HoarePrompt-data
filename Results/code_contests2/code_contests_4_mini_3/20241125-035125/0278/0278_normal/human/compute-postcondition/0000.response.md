The code takes input for two variables, `n` and `V`, and assigns them values based on user input. The `map(int, raw_input().split())` function converts the input into two integers. The previous values of `n` and `V` are not specified, but they will now be assigned new integer values from the input. The lists `a` and `b` are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is a new input integer between 1 and 20; `V` is a new input integer between 1 and 10000; `a` is a list of n positive integers; `b` is a list of n non-negative integers.**
