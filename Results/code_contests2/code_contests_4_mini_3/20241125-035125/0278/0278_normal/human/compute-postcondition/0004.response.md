Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `V`, and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. It computes a minimum value based on the elements of the lists `a` and `b` using a specific calculation involving division and the `reduce` function, and then prints the minimum value. The function does not validate the inputs beyond their expected types and sizes, so edge cases related to invalid inputs (e.g., zero values in list `b`, which could lead to division by zero) are not handled explicitly. **
