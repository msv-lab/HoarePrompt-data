The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parentheses in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it seems to operate on certain implied inputs: an integer `n` within the range 1 to 20, an integer `V` within the range 1 to 10000, a list `a` of `n` positive integers where each element is between 1 and 100, and a list `b` of `n` non-negative integers where each element is between 0 and 100.

Given the output description is missing in this case, we cannot determine the specific return values or cases. Therefore, we can only outline the expected inputs without detailing the output.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), an integer `V` (1 ≤ V ≤ 10000), a list `a` of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100), and a list `b` of `n` non-negative integers (0 ≤ bi ≤ 100).**
