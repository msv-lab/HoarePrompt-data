The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `c` of integers (0s and 1s) read from input. It checks for the last index where the values in `c` differ from the next value. If such an index exists, it returns that index incremented by one; otherwise, it returns 0. The function does not handle cases where the input format might be incorrect or where `n` is less than 2, as it relies on the assumption that valid input is always provided.
