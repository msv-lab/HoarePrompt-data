According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `n - 2` down to `0`, which means it will execute while `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, which implies that `n - 2` is at least `0`. Therefore, the loop can execute again if `i` is at least `0`. If `n` is 2, `i` would be `0` when the loop starts, and it would execute once more. 

We need to ensure that `i` is updated correctly for the next iteration. Since the loop is decrementing `i`, if it was `0` at the end of the last iteration, we need to adjust `i` to `-1` for it to exit the loop after this iteration. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `n` must remain the same (still greater than or equal to 2).
2. `i` should be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.
3. There is no change needed for `ans` since it is dependent on the first two elements of `c`, which are unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ans` is 0, `i` is -1**
