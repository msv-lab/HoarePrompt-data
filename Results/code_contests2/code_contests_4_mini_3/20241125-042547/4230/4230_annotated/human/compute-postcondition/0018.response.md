Output State: **If `n` is at least 2, `c` is a list of at least 2 integers, and `ans` is set to `i + 1` (where `i` is the index where the first unequal pair is found) if `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`. If no such pair exists, `ans` remains 0. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains 0.**
