Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ans` is 0, and `i` is -1. If the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` of the list `c` are not equal, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` and the loop or conditional structure is exited. If the elements are equal, no changes are made to `ans`, and the program continues executing beyond the if statement.***
