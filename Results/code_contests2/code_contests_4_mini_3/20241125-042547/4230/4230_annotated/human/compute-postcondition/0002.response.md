The variable `c` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes the input string from `raw_input()`, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the result to `c`. The variable `n` is the first integer from the list `c`. Since `c` is being reassigned, the previous value of `n` is affected by the new input, but we cannot determine the specific values without the input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `c` now holds a list of integers and `n` takes the first integer from that list.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the new input list `c`, `c` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 (left exit) or 1 (right exit)**
