Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ans` is set to 1 if the first two elements of `c` are different (i.e., `c[0]` is not equal to `c[1]`). In this case, the loop or if statement is exited immediately. If the first two elements of `c` are the same, `ans` remains 0 and no further action is taken.***
