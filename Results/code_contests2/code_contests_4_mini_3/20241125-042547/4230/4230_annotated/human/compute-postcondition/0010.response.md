`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 0, so `ans` will be 0 + 1, which results in `ans` becoming 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0**
