Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of at least 2 integers, and `ans` is 0. If `c[i]` (where `i` is `n - 2`) is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is set to `i + 1` (which is `n - 1`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]`, the value of `ans` remains 0 as the condition is not met, and the program continues without modifying `ans`.***
