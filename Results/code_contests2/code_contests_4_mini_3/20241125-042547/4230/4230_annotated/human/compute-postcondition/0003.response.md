The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The state of `n` and `c` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the first integer from the new input list `c`, `c` is a list of `n` integers, and `ans` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the new input list `c`, `c` is a list of n integers, and `ans` is initialized to 0**
