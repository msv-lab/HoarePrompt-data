The value of `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The current value of `i` is -1, so `ans` becomes -1 + 1 = 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ans` is 0, `i` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ans` is 0, `i` is -1**
