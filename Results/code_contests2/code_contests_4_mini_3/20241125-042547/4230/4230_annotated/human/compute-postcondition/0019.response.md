The `print(ans)` statement outputs the value of `ans`. The initial state specifies that if `n` is at least 2, `c` contains at least 2 integers, and `ans` is set based on the index of the first unequal pair. If no such pair exists, `ans` remains 0. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `ans` also remains 0.

Since the code only involves printing `ans` and does not modify any variables, the output state reflects the value of `ans` at the time of the print statement.

Output State: **`ans` is either set to the index of the first unequal pair (if such a pair exists) or remains 0 if no such pair exists or if `n` is less than 2.**
