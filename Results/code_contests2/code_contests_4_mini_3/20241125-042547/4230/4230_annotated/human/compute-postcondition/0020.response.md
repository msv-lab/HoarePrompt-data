The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `c`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint \( 2 \leq n \leq 200,000 \). The parameter `c` is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer is either 0 (indicating a left exit) or 1 (indicating a right exit). 

The function's return value is determined based on the values in the list `c`. Specifically, it checks the contents of the list and returns a result based on the conditions described in the outputs. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `c` of integers (0s and 1s), and return a result based on the exits indicated in the list.
