According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 2` to `0`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `2`, which means there must be at least two integers in the list `c`. 

Before the loop starts, `n` is the first integer from the list `c`, and `ans` is initialized to `0`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `n` is at least `2`, and we also need to set the initial value of `i` for the loop, which will start at `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 2**
