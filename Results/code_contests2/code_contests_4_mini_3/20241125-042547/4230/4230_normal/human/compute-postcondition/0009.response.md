According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be adjusted to reflect the next iteration of the loop. 

Given that `i` was `n - 2` at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `n - 3`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` will still be non-negative in the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted as the conditions for `c` and `ans` are not relevant for the loop execution itself; they will be managed in the loop body.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is set to `i + 1` (where `i` is `n - 3`)**
