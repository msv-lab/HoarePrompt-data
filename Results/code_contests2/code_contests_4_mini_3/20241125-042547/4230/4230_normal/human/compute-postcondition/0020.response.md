The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as the signature indicates no parameters are passed in. However, it operates on the global context where `n` is an integer constrained between 2 and 200,000, and `c` is a list of integers of length `n` containing only the values 0 or 1. The function returns a value based on the contents of the list `c`. 

The output cases are as follows: 
- If all elements in `c` are 0, the function returns a specific message indicating that all doors lead to the left exit.
- If all elements in `c` are 1, the function returns a specific message indicating that all doors lead to the right exit.
- If there are both 0s and 1s in `c`, the function returns a message indicating that there are mixed exits.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to evaluate the list `c` and determine the type of exits based on the values it contains.

Functionality: **The function evaluates the list of integers `c` to determine if all doors lead to the left exit, all lead to the right exit, or if there are mixed exits.**
