Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, and `i` is `n - 3`. If the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` in list `c` are not equal, then `ans` is set to `i + 1` (which is `n - 2`), and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]`, `ans` remains unchanged, and the program continues beyond this if statement.***
