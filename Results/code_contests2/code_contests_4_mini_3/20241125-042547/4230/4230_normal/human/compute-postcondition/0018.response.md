Output State: **If n is at least 2, then after the loop executes, `ans` is the index of the last element in `c` that differs from its subsequent element (if such an index exists). If all elements from index `n - 2` down to 0 are equal to their next element, `ans` remains 0. If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 0.**
