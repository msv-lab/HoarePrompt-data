Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is set to `i + 1` (where `i` is `n - 2`) if the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in list `c` are not equal, indicating a difference between the last two elements of the relevant sublist. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged at 0, as the condition to update `ans` was not met.***
