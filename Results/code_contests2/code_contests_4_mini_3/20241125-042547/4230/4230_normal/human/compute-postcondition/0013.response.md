According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which starts from `n - 2` and decrements until it is no longer greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, which means `i` must be at least `0` (since it starts at `n - 2`, which is at least `0` when `n` is 2). 

If `i` is currently at `n - 3`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `n - 2` on the next iteration. This means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be adjusted to `n - 3`, and we must ensure that `n` is still greater than or equal to 2.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to `n - 3` (which is the current value of `i` being decremented).
- We do not have to change `n` as it remains valid for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - 3`**
