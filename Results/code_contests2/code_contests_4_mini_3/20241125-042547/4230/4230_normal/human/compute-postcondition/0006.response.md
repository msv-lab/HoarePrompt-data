The code assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, therefore `ans` will be `n - 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers mapped from the input, `ans` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, and the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in list `c` are not equal.**
