The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 3`, we can express `ans` as `(n - 3) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`. The values of `n`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - 3`, and `ans` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is `n - 2**
