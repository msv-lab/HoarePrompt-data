Functionality: ** The function accepts input for the number of elements `n` and a list of integers `c`. It evaluates the list to find the index of the last element that differs from the next element. If all elements are the same or if `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. The result is printed, indicating whether there is a transition point in the list or if all elements are equal. **
