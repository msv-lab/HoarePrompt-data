Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, and if the value at index `i` (where `i` is `n - 3`) is not equal to the value at index `i + 1`, then `ans` is set to `i + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
