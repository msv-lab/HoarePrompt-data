The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `c` are not affected by this line, as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `c` is a list of integers mapped from the input, where each integer is either 0 or 1; `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `c` is a list of integers mapped from the input, where each integer is either 0 or 1; `ans` is 0**
