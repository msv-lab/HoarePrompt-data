The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers mapped from the input, `ans` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, and the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in list `c` are not equal, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
