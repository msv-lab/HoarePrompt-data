The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
