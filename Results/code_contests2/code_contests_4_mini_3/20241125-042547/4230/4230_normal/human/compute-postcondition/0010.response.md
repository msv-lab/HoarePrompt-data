The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is defined as `n - 3`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the value of `i` will be greater than or equal to -1. Therefore, `ans` will be at least 0. The output state is defined by the values of `n`, `c`, and the newly calculated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is greater than or equal to 0**
