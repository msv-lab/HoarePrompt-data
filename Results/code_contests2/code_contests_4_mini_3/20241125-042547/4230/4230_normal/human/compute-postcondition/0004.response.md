According to the code, the loop will execute if `n - 2` is greater than or equal to 0. This means `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to run. The variable `i` starts at `n - 2` and will decrement until it reaches -1. At the start of the loop, `ans` is 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop itself. 

So for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 and that `i` starts at `n - 2`. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a list of integers mapped from the input, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`**
