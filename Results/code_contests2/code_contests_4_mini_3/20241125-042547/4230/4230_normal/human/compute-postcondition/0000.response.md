The code snippet assigns the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to `n`. The `raw_input()` function will accept a line of input, which is then split into individual string representations of numbers, and `map(int, ...)` converts each of these strings to integers. Therefore, `n` will be assigned a list of integers based on the input.

Since the initial state indicates that `n` is an integer, and the code is actually assigning a map object (which will become a list of integers), this means `n` will no longer be a single integer but will be a list of integers instead.

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers created from input, `c` is a list of integers of length n where each integer is either 0 or 1**
