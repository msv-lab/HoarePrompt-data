To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the expected behavior.

### Problem Description Summary:
- We have a sequence of doors, where each door is represented as either `0` (left exit) or `1` (right exit).
- Mr. Black can exit the house if all doors in at least one exit are open.
- We need to find the smallest index `k` such that after opening the first `k` doors, all doors of at least one exit are open.

### Provided Program:
```python
n = map(int, raw_input().split())
n = n[0]
c = map(int, raw_input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if c[i] != c[i + 1]:
        ans = i + 1
        break
print(ans)
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program reads the number of doors `n` and the list `c` which indicates which door belongs to which exit.
2. It initializes `ans` to 0 and iterates over the list `c` from the second last element to the first.
3. The condition `if c[i] != c[i + 1]` checks if the current door and the next door belong to different exits. If so, it sets `ans` to `i + 1` and breaks out of the loop.
4. Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Issues Identified:
- The program does not correctly determine the smallest index `k` such that all doors in at least one exit are open. Instead, it only checks adjacent doors and sets `ans` to the index where the first change occurs between different exits.
- For example, consider the input:
  ```
  5
  0 1 1 0 0
  ```
  After opening the first three doors `0 1 1`, Mr. Black has not opened all doors for either exit (the left exit still has one door closed, and the right exit has one door closed). The expected answer should be `5`, but the program would return `2` (the index at which the change occurs).

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle scenarios where the requirement for exiting (having all doors in at least one exit open) is not met, as it does not correctly track the counts of opened doors for each exit.

Correctness: **False**.
