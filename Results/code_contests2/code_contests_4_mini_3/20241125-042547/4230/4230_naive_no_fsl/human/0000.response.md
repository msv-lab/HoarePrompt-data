Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the smallest index `k` such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first `k` doors.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding `k`:** The program is iterating backwards through the list of doors and checking if two consecutive doors belong to different exits. This logic does not guarantee that all doors in at least one exit are open. The requirement is that after opening the first `k` doors, all doors in at least one of the exits (either left or right) must be open.

2. **Missing Count Logic:** The program does not maintain a count of how many doors from each exit have been opened. It needs to keep track of how many doors of type `0` (left exit) and type `1` (right exit) have been opened to determine if all doors in either exit are open.

### Example Case to Illustrate the Problem:
Consider the input:
```
5
0 1 0 1 0
```
In this case:
- After opening the first door (`0`), Mr. Black cannot exit (0 open).
- After opening the second door (`1`), still cannot exit (1 left, 1 right open).
- After opening the third door (`0`), still cannot exit (2 left, 1 right open).
- After opening the fourth door (`1`), still cannot exit (2 left, 2 right open).
- After opening the fifth door (`0`), now he can exit (3 left, 2 right open).

The correct index `k` should be `5`, but the program will output `1` since it checks only for consecutive differing doors.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
