The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. However, the value of `a` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific value of `h`. The states of the other variables (`c`, `i`, and `copya`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `copya` is 0, and `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10` (where `a` is unknown)**
