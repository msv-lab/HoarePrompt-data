The variable `a` is updated by adding `10 ** c * h` to its previous value. Since `c` is greater than 0, `10 ** c` is guaranteed to be a positive integer, making `10 ** c * h` also dependent on the value of `h`. The exact values of `h` and `a` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the new value of `a` directly. However, we note that `ans` is updated, which suggests that some operation has been performed involving the new value of `a`. The other variables (`c`, `i`, and `copya`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is updated with new value added to `a`.**
