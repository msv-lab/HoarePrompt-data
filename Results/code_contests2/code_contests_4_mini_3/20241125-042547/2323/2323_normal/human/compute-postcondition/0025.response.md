Postcondition: ***`c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `copya` is 0, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` if the last digit of `a` is not 0. If the last digit of `a` is 0, `h` is 0, and `a` is updated to 10 raised to the power of `c` multiplied by `h` plus the integer division of `a` by 10, leaving `ans` unchanged.***
