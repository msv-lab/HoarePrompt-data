Postcondition: ***`c` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `copya` is 0; if `a` is not a multiple of 10, `h` is set to the last digit of `a`, `a` is reduced by removing the last digit, and `a` is updated with `10 ** c * h` added to the remaining digits of `a`, while `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `a % b`. If `a` is a multiple of 10, `h` is set to the last digit of `a`, `a` is reduced by removing the last digit, and `a` is updated with `10 ** c * h` added to the remaining digits of `a`. In both cases, `a` is transformed by moving the last digit to the front after being multiplied by `10 ** c`.***
