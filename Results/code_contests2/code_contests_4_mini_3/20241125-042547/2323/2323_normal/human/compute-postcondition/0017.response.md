The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which calculates the remainder of `a` when divided by 10. The last digit of `a` is not 0, so `h` will be a non-zero value. Other variables `c`, `i`, `copya`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `h` as the last digit of `a`.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, the last digit of `a` is not 0, and `h` is the last digit of `a`.**
