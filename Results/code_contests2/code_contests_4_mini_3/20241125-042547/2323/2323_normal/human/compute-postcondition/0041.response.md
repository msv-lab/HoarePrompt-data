The code `a //= 10` performs an integer division of `a` by 10 and assigns the result back to `a`. The variable `a` is unknown, but it is being modified. The values of `c`, `i`, and `copya` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `a` without specifying its exact new value.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `copya` is 0, and `a` is modified to `a // 10`**
