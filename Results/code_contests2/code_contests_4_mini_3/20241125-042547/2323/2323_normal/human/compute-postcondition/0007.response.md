The variable `copya` is assigned the value of `a // 10`, and then `copya` is updated by performing an integer division of `copya` by 10. Since `copya` is initialized as `a // 10`, the resulting value will be `(a // 10) // 10`, which simplifies to `a // 100`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `Stepan's integer is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8; a is greater than or equal to 10; b is an input integer; c is 1; copya is a // 100`.
