The value of `copya` is assigned the value of `a`. The variable `a` retains its original value, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is equal to `a`.
