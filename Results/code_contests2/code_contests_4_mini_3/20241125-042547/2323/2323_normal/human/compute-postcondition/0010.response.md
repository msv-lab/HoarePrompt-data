The variable `copya` is assigned the value of `a // 100`, which is at least 1 since `a` is greater than or equal to 100. After executing the statement `copya //= 10`, the value of `copya` is divided by 10. Therefore, the new value of `copya` will be `copya // 10`.

The previous value of `copya` can be at least 1 (if `a` is 100), hence the new value of `copya` will be 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `Stepan's integer` is a positive integer string, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is greater than or equal to 100, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and `copya` is now 0.

Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer string, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is greater than or equal to 100, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and `copya` is 0**.
