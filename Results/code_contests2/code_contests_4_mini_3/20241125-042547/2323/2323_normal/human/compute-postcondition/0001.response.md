The variable `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer.
