The value of `copya` is assigned the result of `copya //= 10`, which means `copya` is divided by 10 using integer division. The previous value of `copya` is equal to `a`, so the new value of `copya` will be `a // 10`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `copya`.

Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is equal to `a // 10**
