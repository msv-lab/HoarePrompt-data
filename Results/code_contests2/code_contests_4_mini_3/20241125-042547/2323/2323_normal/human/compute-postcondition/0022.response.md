The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Since `a` is a multiple of 10, the result of `a % 10` is 0. The other variables (`c`, `i`, `copya`, `ans`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `a` is a multiple of 10, and `h` is 0.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `a` is a multiple of 10, and `h` is 0**
