The variable `c` is incremented by 1, and `c` previously had a value of 2. After execution, `c` becomes 3. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer string, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is greater than or equal to 100, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, and `copya` is 0.
