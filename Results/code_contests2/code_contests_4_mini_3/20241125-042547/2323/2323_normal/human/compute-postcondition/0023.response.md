The code `a //= 10` performs integer division on `a` by 10 and assigns the result back to `a`. Since `a` is a multiple of 10, dividing it by 10 will yield a new value for `a` that is less than its original value. The values of the other variables (`c`, `i`, `copya`, `ans`, and `h`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `a` is a multiple of 10, `h` is 0, and `a` is now `a // 10`**
