According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `copya` is a non-zero value (truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is 0, which means the loop will not execute again as 0 is considered falsy. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted since they do not influence the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer string, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is greater than or equal to 100, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, and `copya` is greater than 0**
