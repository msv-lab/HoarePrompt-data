The value of `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state does not specify the exact input for `a`, so it remains an input integer. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, and `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is an input integer**
