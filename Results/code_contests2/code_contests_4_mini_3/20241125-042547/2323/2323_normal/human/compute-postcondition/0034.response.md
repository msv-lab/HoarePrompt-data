Postcondition: ***`c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `copya` is 0. If the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` is set to the last digit of `a`, `a` is updated by removing its last digit and prepending `10` raised to the power of `c` multiplied by `h`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `a % b`. If the last digit of `a` is 0, `h` is also set to the last digit of `a`, `a` is updated by removing its last digit and prepending `10` raised to the power of `c` multiplied by `h`, but `ans` remains unchanged.***
