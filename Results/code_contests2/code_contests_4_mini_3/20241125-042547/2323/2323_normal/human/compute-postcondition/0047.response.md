The function `func` accepts a parameter `stepan`, which is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits. It also accepts a parameter `m`, which is an integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^8\). The function's output is not specified in the provided constraints, so we cannot detail specific return values or conditions. Therefore, based on the information given, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer represented as a string `stepan` with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, and an integer `m` such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8. The return value is not specified.**
