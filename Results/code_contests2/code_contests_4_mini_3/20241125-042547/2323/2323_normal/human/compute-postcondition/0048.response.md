Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers inputted by the user, calculates the number of digits in the first integer, and finds the minimum remainder of the first integer when divided by the second integer after potentially rearranging its digits. If the second integer is zero, it will raise a division error during the calculation. If the first integer is zero, the output remains unchanged from its initial value. The function does not return a value but prints the result. **
