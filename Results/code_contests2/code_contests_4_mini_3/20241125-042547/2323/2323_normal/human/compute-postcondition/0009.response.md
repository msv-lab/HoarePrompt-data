According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue executing as long as `copya` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is equal to `a // 100`. Since `a` is greater than or equal to 10, `copya` will be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must be greater than 0. Since `copya` is derived from `a`, and `a` is at least 10, we can conclude that `a` should be at least 100 for `copya` to be greater than 0.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `a` must be at least 100.

State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is greater than or equal to 100; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `copya` is `a // 100`**
