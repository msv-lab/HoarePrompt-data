The variable `copya` is assigned the value of `a`, which is an integer obtained from input. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer value obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8, `c` is 0, and `copya` is equal to `a`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer value obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8, `c` is 0, and `copya` is equal to `a**
