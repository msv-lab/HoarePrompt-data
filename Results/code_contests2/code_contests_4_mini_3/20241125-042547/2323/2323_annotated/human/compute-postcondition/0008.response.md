The value of `c` is incremented by 1, and `c` was previously 1, so after execution, `c` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is at least 10, `b` is an integer obtained from input within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8, `c` is 2, and `copya` is at least 0.

Output State: **`a` is at least 10, `b` is an integer obtained from input within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8, `c` is 2, `copya` is at least 0**
