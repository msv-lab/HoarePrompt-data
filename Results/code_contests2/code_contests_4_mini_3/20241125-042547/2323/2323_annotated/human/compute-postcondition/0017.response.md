The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. The initial state indicates that the value of `a` modulo 10 is not equal to 0, which means `h` will take a value that is the remainder of `a` when divided by 10. The other variables `c`, `copya`, `ans`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, `i` is 0, and `h` is the value of `a % 10` (which is not 0).

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, `i` is 0, `h` is the value of `a % 10` (which is not 0)**
