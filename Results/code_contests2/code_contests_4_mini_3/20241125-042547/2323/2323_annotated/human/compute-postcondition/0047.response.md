The function `func` does not explicitly take parameters in the provided code snippet; however, based on the given constraints, it is implied that the function operates on an input `a` and an input `b`. The parameter `a` is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits. The parameter `b` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq b \leq 10^8 \). 

The output behavior is not specified in the prompt, so we cannot determine the exact return values. However, based on the constraints, we can infer that the function likely processes these inputs in some way.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a positive integer represented as a string (length between 2 and 200,000 digits), and a parameter `b`, which is an integer (2 <= b <= 10^8). The specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
