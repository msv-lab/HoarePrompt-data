The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which calculates the last digit of `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` is updated based on the last digit, and since `h` would be the last digit of `a`, `h` will hold this value. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `h`.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 2, `copya` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is updated based on the last digit, and `h` is the last digit of `a`**.
