The value of `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `b` is not known, but it is stated that `b` is an integer such that 2 <= b <= 10^8. Therefore, after execution, the value of `b` will be updated to the integer input. The value of `a` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer value obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8**
