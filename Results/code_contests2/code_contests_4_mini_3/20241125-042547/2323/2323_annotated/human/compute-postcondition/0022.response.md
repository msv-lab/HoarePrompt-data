The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Given that `a % 10` is equal to 0, `h` will also be 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, `i` is 0, `a % 10` is equal to 0, and `h` is 0.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, `i` is 0, `a % 10` is equal to 0, and `h` is 0**.
