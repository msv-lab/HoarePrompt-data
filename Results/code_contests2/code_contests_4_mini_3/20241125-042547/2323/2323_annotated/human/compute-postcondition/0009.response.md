According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is truthy (i.e., not zero), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is at least 0, which means it could be 0 or a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must be greater than 0.

State: **`a` is at least 10, `b` is an integer obtained from input within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8, `c` is 2, `copya` is greater than 0**
