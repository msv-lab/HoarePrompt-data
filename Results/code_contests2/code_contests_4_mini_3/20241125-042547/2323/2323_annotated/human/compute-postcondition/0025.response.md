Postcondition: ***`c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, and `i` is 0. If `a % 10` is not equal to 0, then `h` is the value of `a % 10`, `a` is updated by removing its last digit and prepending `h` multiplied by `10 ** c`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `a % b`. If `a % 10` equals 0, then `h` is still the value of `a % 10`, `a` is updated similarly, and `ans` remains unchanged. In both cases, `h` is the last digit of `a`, and `a` is modified accordingly.***
