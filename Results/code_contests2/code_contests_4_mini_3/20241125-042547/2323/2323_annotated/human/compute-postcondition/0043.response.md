Postcondition: ***`c` is greater than 2, `copya` is 0, and `i` is 2. If `a % 10` is not 0, then `h` is the last digit of `a`, `a` is updated by removing its last digit and prepending `10` raised to the power of `c` multiplied by `h`, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `a % b` (note that the operation on `ans` cannot be completed due to undefined `b`). If `a % 10` is 0, then `h` is still the last digit of `a`, `a` is updated similarly to include the last digit removed, and it is also updated by prepending `10` raised to the power of `c` multiplied by `h`. In either case, `a` is effectively modified to represent a new value influenced by `h` and `c`.***
