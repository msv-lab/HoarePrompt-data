The operation `copya //= 10` performs an integer division of `copya` by `10`. The value of `copya` is initially equal to `a`, which is an integer obtained from input. Therefore, after this operation, `copya` will be reduced to its integer quotient when divided by `10`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `copya` after the division. The specific value of `copya` after the operation will depend on the input value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer value obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8, `c` is 0, and `copya` is equal to `a // 10**
