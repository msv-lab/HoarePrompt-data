Postcondition: ***`c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `i` is 1, and `a` is updated based on the last digit. If `a % 10` is not 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`, and `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a // 10`. If `a % 10` is 0, `h` is also the last digit of `a`, and `a` is similarly updated to `10 ** c * h + a // 10`. In both cases, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `a % b`, covering cases where `a` is a multiple of 10 and where the last digit is non-zero.***
