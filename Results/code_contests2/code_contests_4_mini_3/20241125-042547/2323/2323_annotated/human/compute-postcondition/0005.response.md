The variable `c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` is 0, so after the execution, `c` becomes 1. The values of the other variables `a`, `b`, and `copya` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an integer value obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8, `c` is 1, and `copya` is equal to `a // 10`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer value obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8, `c` is 1, and `copya` is equal to `a // 10**
