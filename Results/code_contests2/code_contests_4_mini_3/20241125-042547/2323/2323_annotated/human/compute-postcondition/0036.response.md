The value of `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which gives the last digit of `a`. Since `a` is updated based on the last digit, and it is stated that `a` is updated to `10`, if `a` is not 10, then `h` will hold the last digit of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `c`, `copya`, `i`, and the newly computed value of `h`.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 2, `copya` is 0, `i` is 2, and `h` is the last digit of `a`**
