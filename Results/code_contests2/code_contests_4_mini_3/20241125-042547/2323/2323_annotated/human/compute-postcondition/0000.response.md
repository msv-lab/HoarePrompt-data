The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input string representing a positive integer and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `b` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is that `a` is now an integer value obtained from the input, and `b` remains an integer such that 2 <= b <= 10^8.

Output State: **`a` is an integer value obtained from input, `b` is an integer such that 2 <= b <= 10^8**
