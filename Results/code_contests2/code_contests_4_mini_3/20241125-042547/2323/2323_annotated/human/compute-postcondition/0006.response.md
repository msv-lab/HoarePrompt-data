According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop continues as long as `copya` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is equal to `a // 10`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `copya` must be greater than zero. This means that `a` must be at least 10, since `copya` is calculated as `a // 10`.

Given that `copya` is currently equal to `a // 10`, we need to ensure that `a` is at least 10 for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`a` is at least 10, `b` is an integer obtained from input within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8, `c` is 1, and `copya` is equal to `a // 10**
