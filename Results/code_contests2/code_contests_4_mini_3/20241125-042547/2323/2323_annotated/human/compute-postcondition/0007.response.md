The value of `copya` is updated with `copya //= 10`, which means `copya` is divided by 10 and the result is assigned back to `copya`. Given that `copya` is initially equal to `a // 10`, the operation results in `copya` being further divided by 10.

Since `a` is at least 10, `copya` is at least 1 (because `copya = a // 10`). Therefore, after the operation, `copya` will be at least 0, but the exact value depends on the specific value of `a`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is at least 10, `b` is an integer obtained from input within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8, `c` is 1, and `copya` is at least 0**
