The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`, which does not depend on any previous values or calculations, and the other variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an integer value obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an integer value obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8, and `c` is 0**
