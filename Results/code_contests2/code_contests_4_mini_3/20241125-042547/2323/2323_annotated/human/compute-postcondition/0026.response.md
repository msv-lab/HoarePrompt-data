According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `c`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `c`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `c` is greater than 0. Therefore, to allow for one more iteration of the loop, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 1. The variable `c` does not need to be adjusted since it is already greater than 0.

State: **`c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `i` is 1**
