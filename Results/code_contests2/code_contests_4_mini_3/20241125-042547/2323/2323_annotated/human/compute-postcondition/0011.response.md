The value of `c` is incremented by 1, and since `c` is initially 2, after execution, `c` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is at least 10, `b` is an integer within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8, `c` is 3, and `copya` is now its original value divided by 10.

Output State: **`a` is at least 10, `b` is an integer within the range 2 <= b <= 10^8, `c` is 3, and `copya` is now its original value divided by 10**
