You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Stepan has a very big positive integer.

Let's consider all cyclic shifts of Stepan's integer (if we look at his integer like at a string) which are also integers (i.e. they do not have leading zeros). Let's call such shifts as good shifts. For example, for the integer 10203 the good shifts are the integer itself 10203 and integers 20310 and 31020.

Stepan wants to know the minimum remainder of the division by the given number m among all good shifts. Your task is to determine the minimum remainder of the division by m.

Input

The first line contains the integer which Stepan has. The length of Stepan's integer is between 2 and 200 000 digits, inclusive. It is guaranteed that Stepan's integer does not contain leading zeros.

The second line contains the integer m (2 ≤ m ≤ 108) — the number by which Stepan divides good shifts of his integer.

Output

Print the minimum remainder which Stepan can get if he divides all good shifts of his integer by the given number m.

Output

123

Note

In the first example all good shifts of the integer 521 (good shifts are equal to 521, 215 and 152) has same remainder 2 when dividing by 3.

In the second example there are only two good shifts: the Stepan's integer itself and the shift by one position to the right. The integer itself is 1001 and the remainder after dividing it by 5 equals 1. The shift by one position to the right equals to 1100 and the remainder after dividing it by 5 equals 0, which is the minimum possible remainder.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = 0
    copya = a
    while copya:
        copya //= 10
        
        c += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `if a is at least 1 then c` is the count of digits in `a`, copya is 0 at the end. if a is 0 the loop doesn't execute and c remains 0, copya is 0.
    ans = a % b
    for i in range(c):
        if a % 10 != 0:
            h = a % 10
            a //= 10
            a = 10 ** c * h + a
            ans = min(ans, a % b)
        else:
            h = a % 10
            a //= 10
            a = 10 ** c * h + a
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `c` is greater than 0, the loop executes `c` times. After the loop, `copya` remains 0, `i` is equal to `c - 1`, and `a` is modified based on the last digit of the original `a`, with `ans` potentially updated to be the minimum of its current value and `a % b`. If `c` is 0 (which occurs if `a` is less than 1), the loop does not execute, and the values of `copya` remain 0, `i` remains undefined, and `a` is unchanged. Additionally, if `b` is not defined or is 0, the operation on `ans` cannot be completed, leading to potential undefined behavior.
    print(ans)

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
