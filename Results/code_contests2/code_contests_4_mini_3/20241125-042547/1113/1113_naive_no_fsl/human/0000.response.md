Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of transforming a valid Sudoku solution into an anti-sudoku. 

The key issues are:

1. The program only changes the digit '9' to '1' in every row of the provided Sudoku, which will not ensure that each row, each column, and each 3x3 block contains at least two equal elements. The other numbers (1-8) remain unchanged, which means it is possible that some rows, columns, or blocks could still contain all unique values, violating the anti-sudoku condition.

2. Since the program only modifies a single digit ('9' to '1'), it does not fulfill the requirement of changing at most 9 elements to ensure that every row, column, and block has repeated numbers. This is particularly problematic because if the input does not contain '9', no modifications will be made at all.

For example, consider the following valid Sudoku input:

```
123456789
456789123
789123456
234567891
567891234
891234567
345678912
678912345
912345678
```

If we run the provided code, it would not change any numbers because there are no '9's present. The output would remain the same as the input, which would not satisfy the conditions for an anti-sudoku.

Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
