According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must be a non-empty string. The variable `i` is currently set to 9, which is not relevant for the loop execution since it will be reassigned to each character in `row`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `row` is a non-empty string. If `row` is an empty string, the loop will not execute. 

State: **`nRow` is `''`, `res` contains the same characters as `nRow`, `i` is not relevant (will be reassigned), `row` is a non-empty string**
