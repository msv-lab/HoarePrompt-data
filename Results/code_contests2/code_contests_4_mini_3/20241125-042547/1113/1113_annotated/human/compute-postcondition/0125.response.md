The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the string '1' to its previous value. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it is implied that it is a string. The values of `res` and `row` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is updated by appending '1', `res` retains its previous value, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character remaining.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated by appending '1', `res` retains its previous value, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character remaining**
