According to the code, the loop iterates 9 times, and the variable `i` is used as the loop index. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at 8 (the last index in the range of 9). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 9. Since `i` is already 8, it needs to be incremented to 9, and we must ensure that the loop does not execute again. There are no other states that need to be adjusted based on the provided information.

State: **`nRow` is a string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1' from `row`, `res` contains the same characters as `nRow`, `i` is 9**
