The value of `nRow` is appended with the string `'1'`. The previous state of `nRow` is not provided, but it is implied that it exists as a string. The value of `row` remains unchanged, and `i` is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is the previous value of `nRow` followed by '1'.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is the previous value of `nRow` followed by '1'**
