The value of `row` is assigned the result of `input().strip()`, which takes input from the user and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The value of `res` is unaffected by this operation, and `i` remains 9. Therefore, the output state reflects that `row` is now the user input string (after stripping), while `res` retains its previous value.

Output State: **`res` now contains `nRow`, which is the string formed by replacing '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is 9, and `row` is the user input string after stripping**.
