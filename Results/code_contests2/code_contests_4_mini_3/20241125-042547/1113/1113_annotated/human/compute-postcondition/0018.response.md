The variable `nRow` is being appended with the string '1'. The initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`, but since it is being modified by appending, we can assume it exists in a string context. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` has been modified.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is the next character in row, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` has been appended with '1'**.
