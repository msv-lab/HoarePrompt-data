The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after appending `i`, `nRow` will take the value of `i`. The variable `row` remains unchanged, and `res` is not directly affected by this operation. The condition that `i` is not equal to '9' ensures that `i` can have any value other than '9'.

Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now equal to `i`, `res` has `nRow` appended to it (but its specific value is not known), and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now equal to `i`, `res` has `nRow` appended to it, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
