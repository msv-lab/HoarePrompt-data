The value of `nRow` is appended with the string '1', which changes its value from an empty string to '1'. The other variables (`row`, `res`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `res` has `nRow` appended to it, and `i` is equal to the string '9'.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `res` has `nRow` appended to it, and `i` is equal to the string '9'**
