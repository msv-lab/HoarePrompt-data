According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, it can execute again as long as there are more characters to iterate over. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character of `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next character in `row`. If `row` has a length of at least 3, we can say that `i` is the second character (if `row` has only two characters, there will be no next iteration). Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute again, `i` must be adjusted to the next character in `row`, and the length of `row` must be at least 3.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated according to the last character processed**.
