Output State: **`nRow` is the string formed by transforming each character in `row` such that every occurrence of '9' is replaced by '1', while all other characters remain unchanged. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop executes for each character in `row`, and `nRow` will contain a length equal to that of `row`. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string.**
