To determine the adjustments needed for the states at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information.

1. The variable `i` is being iterated over the elements in `row`. The loop will execute as long as there are more elements in `row` to iterate over.
2. The state indicates that `res` is a list of strings with '9' replaced by '1' and that the logic for updating `nRow` depends on the current value of `i`.
3. Since the loop iterates over `row`, we need to deduce whether there are more elements left in `row` to process.

From the provided information:
- At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last element that was processed from `row`.
- To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to represent the next element in `row`, and there must be at least one more element in `row`.

Therefore:
- If `i` is currently the last element in `row`, for the loop to execute again, `row` must have at least one more element (i.e., `row` must have at least two elements originally).
- The new value of `i` should be the next element in `row`.

Thus, the adjusted states would require that `row` contains at least one more element and that `i` is updated to reflect that next element.

State: **`res` is a list of strings with '9' replaced by '1', `row` contains at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `row`**
