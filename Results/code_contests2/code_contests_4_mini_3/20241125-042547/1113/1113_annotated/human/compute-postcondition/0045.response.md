According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in `row`. The state indicates that at the end of the last iteration, `row` has at least one more character to iterate over, ensuring that the loop can execute one more time. Since `row` has a length greater than the current index of processing, the next character will be processed in the next iteration.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment the index that is being processed and ensure that the next character is prepared for processing. Given that `row` has at least one more character, the current index must be increased by 1.

State: **`nRow` is updated based on the last processed character, `row` has at least one more character to iterate over, index is incremented by 1**
