According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character from `row`. Since `row` contains at least one more character, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the next character in `row` will be used for `i` in the upcoming iteration.

Assuming that `row` has a total of `n` characters, and `i` was just the character at index `n - 1` in the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the character at index `n` (the next character). Also, since `nRow` is being modified based on the value of `i`, it will also need to reflect the corresponding change based on the new value of `i`.

However, since `row` has at least one more character, we can conclude that `i` will take on the next character in `row`, and `nRow` will be updated accordingly.

State: **`res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains at least one more character**
