According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must be a non-empty string, as the loop iterates over each character in the string. The current value of `i` is 9, which is not relevant for the loop execution since `i` will take on the values of the characters in `row` during the loop. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `row` must not be an empty string.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9**
