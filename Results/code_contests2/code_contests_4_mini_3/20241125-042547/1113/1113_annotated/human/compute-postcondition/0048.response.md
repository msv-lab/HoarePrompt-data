According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. The current state does not specify the value of `i`, but since the loop is defined to iterate for `i` in `range(9)`, it can execute a total of 9 times, starting from `i = 0` to `i = 8`. 

The states that need to be adjusted depend on the current value of `i`. If `i` is 8 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute again because `i` will equal 9 on the next iteration, which is not less than 9. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to be less than 8.

State: **`row` is a string with characters, nRow is a string with '9' replaced by '1', res is updated by appending nRow, i is 8**
