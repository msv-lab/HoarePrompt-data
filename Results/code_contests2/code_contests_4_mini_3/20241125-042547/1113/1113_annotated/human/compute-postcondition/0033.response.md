The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is an empty string, after this operation, `nRow` becomes '1'. The other variables `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '1', `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string**
