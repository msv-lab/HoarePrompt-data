The code `res.append(nRow)` appends `nRow` to the list `res`. The value of `nRow` depends on the content of `row`. If `row` is an empty string, `nRow` is also an empty string, and `res` remains unchanged. If `row` contains characters, `nRow` contains all characters from `row`, with '9' replaced by '1'. 

Thus, the output state depends on whether `row` is empty or contains characters. 

Output State:
**If `row` is an empty string, then `res` remains unchanged; if `row` contains characters, then `nRow` is a string with '9' replaced by '1', and `res` is updated by appending `nRow`.**
