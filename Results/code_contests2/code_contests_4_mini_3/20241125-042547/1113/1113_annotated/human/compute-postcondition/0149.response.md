The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, but the previous value of `nRow` is unknown, while `i` is defined as the next element in `row`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list of strings with '9' replaced by '1'; `i` is the next element in `row`; `nRow` is updated based on the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`res` is a list of strings with '9' replaced by '1'; `i` is the next element in `row`; `nRow` is updated based on the new value of `i`.**
