Postcondition: ***`row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `i` is the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value, and `res` includes the current representation of `i`. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i` to its previous value, and `res` includes the current representation of `i`.***
