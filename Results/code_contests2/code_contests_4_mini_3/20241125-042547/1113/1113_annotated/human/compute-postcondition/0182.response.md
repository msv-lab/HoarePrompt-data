Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string that is updated based on the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`. The string `res` contains the same characters as the updated `nRow`. The variable `i` is reassigned but remains unchanged in terms of its relevance to `nRow` and `res`.***
