The variable `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is the third character of `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` has a specific character value. The state of `res`, `T`, and `t` are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i`**
