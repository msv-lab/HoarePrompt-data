The variable `nRow` is being modified by concatenating the string `'1'` to its current value. However, the initial value of `nRow` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact outcome of this operation. The variable `i`, which is the first character of `row`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` has been updated but does not specify its new value.

Output State: **`row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'**
