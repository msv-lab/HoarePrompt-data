The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the character '1' to it. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it can be inferred that it now contains the original value plus '1'. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains at least one more character, and `nRow` has been updated to include '1'.

Output State: **`res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains at least one more character, and `nRow` has been updated to include '1'**
