According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. The loop will execute again if there are more elements in `row` after the current value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been updated to the next element in `row`. 

To determine the required states for the next iteration, we need to consider that `i` should now correspond to the next element in `row`. If the last value of `i` was the last element in `row`, then the loop cannot execute again, and we need to adjust accordingly. 

Since we do not have information about the contents of `row` or how many elements it contains, we can only state that for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least one more element than the current `i`. Therefore, we will represent this by stating that `i` should be adjusted to the next index.

State: **`nRow` is updated to include '1' if `i` equals '9'; otherwise, `nRow` includes the value of `i`, `res` contains the same characters as the updated `nRow`, `i` is the next element in `row`**
