The value of `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input string and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous variables `res`, `T`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is `res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string without leading or trailing whitespace.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string without leading or trailing whitespace**
