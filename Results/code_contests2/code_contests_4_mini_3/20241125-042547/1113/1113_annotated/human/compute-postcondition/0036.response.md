Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string that has been updated based on the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` becomes '1' and is appended to `res`. If `i` is any character other than '9', then `nRow` becomes `i` and is appended to `res`. In both cases, `i` is the first character of the non-empty string `row`.***
