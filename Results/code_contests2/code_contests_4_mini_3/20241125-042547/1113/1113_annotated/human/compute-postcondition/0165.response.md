The code appends the value of `i` to `nRow`, which is updated based on the current value of `i`. The previous values of `row`, `i`, `nRow`, and `res` are not specifically affected by this operation since only `nRow` is changed. Therefore, after the execution, `nRow` will include the current character `i`. The output state is: `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` includes the previous value plus `i`, and `res` includes the current representation of `i`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` includes the previous value plus `i`, `res` includes the current representation of `i`**
