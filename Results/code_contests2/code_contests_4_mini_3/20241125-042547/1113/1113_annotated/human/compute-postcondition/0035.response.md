The value of `nRow` is updated by appending `i` to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the operation, `nRow` will contain the value of `i`, which is the first character of `row`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is `i`, `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is `i`, `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string.**
