Postcondition: ***`nRow` is updated based on the character processed. If the character `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i`. In both cases, `row` has at least one more character to iterate over, ensuring that the length of `row` is greater than the current index of processing.***
