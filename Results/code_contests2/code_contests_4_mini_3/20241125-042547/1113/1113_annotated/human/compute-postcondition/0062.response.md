The value of `nRow` is appended with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it will now include '1' at the end of its original value. The variables `row` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value.

Output State: **`row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value**.
