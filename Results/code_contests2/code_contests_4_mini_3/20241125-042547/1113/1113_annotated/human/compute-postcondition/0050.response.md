The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous value of `nRow` was a string with '9' replaced by '1', but now it becomes an empty string. The other variables `row`, `res`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a string with characters, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` is updated by appending the previous value of `nRow`, and `i` is 8.

Output State: **`row` is a string with characters, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` is updated by appending the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 8**
