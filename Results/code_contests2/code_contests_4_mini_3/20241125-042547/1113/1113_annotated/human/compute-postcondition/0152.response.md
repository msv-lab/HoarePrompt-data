Output State: **`nRow` will be the string formed by replacing every instance of '9' in `row` with '1'. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string. If `row` contains characters other than '9', those characters will be included in `nRow` as they are. Therefore, if `row` is empty, `nRow` is '' (empty string); if `row` contains characters, `nRow` will be the transformed string with '9' replaced by '1'.**
