Initial State: `nRow` is `''`, `res` contains the same characters as `nRow`, `i` is 9, and `row` is assigned a new input string.

The loop checks each character in `row`. If the character is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`. Otherwise, it appends the character itself. The variable `res` is updated to contain the same characters as `nRow` after each iteration.

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nRow` is '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is the first character of `row`. `res` contains the same characters as `nRow`. `i` is the first character of `row`.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `nRow` is updated to include '1' if the first character of `row` is '9'; otherwise, `nRow` includes the first character of `row` and the second character of `row`. In either case, `res` contains the same characters as the updated `nRow`, and `i` is the second character of `row`.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `nRow` is further updated based on the second character of `row`. If it is '9', '1' is appended; if not, the second character is included. The variable `res` contains the same characters as the updated `nRow`, and `i` is the third character of `row`.

Edge Cases:
- If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains `''`, `res` is also `''`, and `i` remains 9.
- If `row` does not contain any '9's, `nRow` will be the same as `row` after the loop completes.

Output State: **`nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'; `res` contains the same characters as `nRow`. If `row` is empty, `nRow` and `res` are both `''`, and the loop does not execute.**
