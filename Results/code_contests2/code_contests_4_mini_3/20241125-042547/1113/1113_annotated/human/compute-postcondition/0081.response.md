The code appends the character `'1'` to the string `nRow`. The initial value of `nRow` is equal to the second character of `row`, which is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will now contain the original character plus `'1'`, making it a longer string. The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is the second character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `nRow` is equal to the original `i` plus '1'**
