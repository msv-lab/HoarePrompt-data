The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the next character in `row`. Since `nRow` was not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its previous value. Therefore, we can only state that `nRow` is increased by the character `i`. The state of `row` and `i` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i`**
