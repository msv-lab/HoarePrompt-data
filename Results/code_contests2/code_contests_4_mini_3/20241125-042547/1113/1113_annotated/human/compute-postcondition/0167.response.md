According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is set to the next character in `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next character in `row`, and the length of `row` must be sufficient to provide that next character.

Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, it has at least one more character after the current value of `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be the next character in `row`, and since there are at least two characters, we can ensure that the loop will execute again.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `i` is the next character in `row`**
