The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous value of `nRow` was a string that contained characters of `row`, but it is now overwritten as an empty string. The values of `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is an empty string, `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string without leading or trailing whitespace.

Output State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string without leading or trailing whitespace**
