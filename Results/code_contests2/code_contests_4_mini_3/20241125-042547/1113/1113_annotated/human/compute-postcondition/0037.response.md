According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row`. The loop will continue iterating as long as there are more characters to process in `row`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of the non-empty string `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character that has not been processed yet. This means that `i` should be updated to reflect the next character in `row`.

Thus, if `i` is currently the first character of `row`, we need to adjust it to be the next character in the string. 

Since `nRow` has been updated based on the value of `i`, we need to reflect that `i` has changed and potentially also update `nRow` based on the new value of `i`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that:
- `i` is the next character in `row`
- `nRow` will be updated accordingly based on the new value of `i`.

State: **`nRow` is updated based on the next character in `row`, `i` is the next character in `row`**
