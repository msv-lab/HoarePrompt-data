The value of `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it. The previous state of `nRow` is not explicitly defined, but it is updated based on the next character in `row`, which is represented by `i`. Therefore, the output state indicates that `nRow` is updated, but the exact values are not known.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated based on the next character in `row`, `i` is the next character in `row`**
