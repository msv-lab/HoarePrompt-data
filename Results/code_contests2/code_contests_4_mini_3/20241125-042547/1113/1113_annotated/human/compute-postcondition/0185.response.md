The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`, but the previous value of `nRow` is unknown, and `i` is the next value in `row`. The variable `res` is stated to contain the same characters as the updated `nRow`, but its previous state is also unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nRow` and notes the character content of `res` is now based on the updated `nRow`.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `res` contains the same characters as the updated `nRow`**
