Postcondition: ***`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`: if `i` is '9', `nRow` becomes the next value of `i` concatenated with '1'; otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending `i` to its previous value. The variable `res` retains its previous value, and `row` remains a non-empty string with its first character not being '9'.***
