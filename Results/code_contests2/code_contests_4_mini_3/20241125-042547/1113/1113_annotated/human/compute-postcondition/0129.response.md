Output State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the characters of `row`, replacing every '9' with '1'. The variable `res` retains its previous value, and `row` remains a non-empty string if the loop executes. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, leaving `nRow` as an empty string and `res` unchanged.**
