The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`, but the previous value of `nRow` is unknown, and `i` could be any integer. The value of `res` remains unchanged, and `row` continues to be a non-empty string. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `res` retains its previous value, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character remaining.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `res` retains its previous value, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character remaining**.
