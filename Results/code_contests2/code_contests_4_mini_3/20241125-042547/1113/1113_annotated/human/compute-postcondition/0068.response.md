According to the code, the loop iterates a fixed number of times, specifically 9 times, as indicated by `range(9)`. The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 on each iteration until it reaches 8 (the last valid index for the loop).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have reached 8, which is the last iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be less than 9. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be 9 for the loop to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration.

Other states such as `nRow` and `res` do not need adjustments as they are not directly related to the loop's execution condition.

State: **`nRow` is a string that contains characters from `row`, with each occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'; `res` includes the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 9**
