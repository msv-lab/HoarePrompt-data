The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since `nRow` is equal to the next value of `i`, the new value of `nRow` will be `nRow + i`. The values of `res` and `row` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `nRow` and the unchanged values of `res` and `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is now equal to `nRow + i`, `res` retains its previous value, `row` remains a non-empty string with its first character not being '9'**
