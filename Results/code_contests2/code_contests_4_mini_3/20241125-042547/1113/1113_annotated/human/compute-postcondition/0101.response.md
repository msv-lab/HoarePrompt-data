The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `res` contains `nRow`, this also affects `res`, which will now contain the updated value of `nRow`. The variable `row` remains unchanged, and `i` is still the next character in `row`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` contains at least one more character, and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` contains at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`**
