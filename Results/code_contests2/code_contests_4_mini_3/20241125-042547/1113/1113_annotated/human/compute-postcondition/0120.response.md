According to the code, the loop executes for each character in the string `row`. The loop can continue as long as there are more characters in `row` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, if `row` is a non-empty string and `i` corresponds to the current character in `row`, then `i` will be updated to the next character in `row` for the next iteration.

Since `row` remains a non-empty string with its first character not being '9', it indicates that there are still characters available for iteration. The variable `i` will be updated in the loop to represent the next character in `row` during the next iteration.

To determine the new state, we need to update `nRow` based on the current character `i`. If `i` is the last character in `row`, then `nRow` will be updated to `i`, which will be the position of that character in the iteration. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `row` still has characters left to iterate over.
- `i` will change to the next character in `row`.
- `nRow` will be updated based on the next character's condition.

Assuming `row` is still non-empty and the next character is not '9', we can conclude:

State: **`nRow` is equal to the next value of `i`, `res` retains its previous value, `row` remains a non-empty string with its first character not being '9'**
