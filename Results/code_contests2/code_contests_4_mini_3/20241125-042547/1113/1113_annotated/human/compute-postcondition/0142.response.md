Postcondition: ***`res` contains a list of strings formed by replacing '9' with '1'. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` will be '1'. Otherwise, if `i` is any other value (including '0'), then `nRow` will have the value of `i`, which could be '0' or any other character that is not '9'. Thus, `nRow` will either be '1' or equal to the value of `i`, depending on whether `i` is '9' or not.***
