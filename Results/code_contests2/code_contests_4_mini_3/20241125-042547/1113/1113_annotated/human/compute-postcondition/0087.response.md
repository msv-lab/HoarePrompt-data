Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated such that if `i` is '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1'; otherwise, `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`. This ensures that `nRow` contains either '1' or the character `i`, depending on its value, while maintaining the integrity of the original list `res`.***
