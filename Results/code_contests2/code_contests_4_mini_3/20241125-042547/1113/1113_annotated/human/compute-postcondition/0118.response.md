The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, the resulting value of `nRow` will be equal to the value of `i`. The previous values of `res` and `row` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is now equal to the value of `i`, `res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string, and the first character of `row` is not '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is now equal to the value of `i`, `res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string, and the first character of `row` is not '9'**
