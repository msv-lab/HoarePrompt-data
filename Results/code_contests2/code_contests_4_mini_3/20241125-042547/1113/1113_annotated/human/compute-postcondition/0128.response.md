According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. Since it is stated that `row` remains a non-empty string with at least one more character remaining, it indicates that there are still characters left in `row` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `i` would have taken the value of the current character in `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to take on the next character in the string `row`. Since `row` has at least one more character remaining, we can assume that `i` needs to be updated to reflect the next character in `row`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `row` should still be a non-empty string with at least one more character remaining.
- `i` should take the next character in `row`.

Since we do not have specific information about which character `i` is at the end of the last iteration, we can only say that `i` should refer to the next character in the sequence of `row`.

State: **`nRow` is updated accordingly, `res` retains its previous value, `row` remains a non-empty string with at least one more character remaining, `i` is the next character in `row`**
