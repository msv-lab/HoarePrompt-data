According to the code, the loop can execute if `T` is greater than the current value of `t`. Since the state mentions that `res` contains the transformed strings for each `row`, we need to focus on `T` and `t`. 

If the loop has executed `t` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be at least `t + 1`. Given that the current iteration has completed and `t` has reached its current value, `T` must be adjusted to be greater than `t`.

Assuming `T` is greater than `0` at the start of the loop, we need to ensure that `T` is now at least `t + 1`.

State: **`res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `t` is the current value**
