The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `T`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `nRow` while noting the unchanged values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is ''**
