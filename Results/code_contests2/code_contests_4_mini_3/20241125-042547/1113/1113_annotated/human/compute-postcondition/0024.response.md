Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, and `row` is a string with at least one more character. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated by appending '1'; otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i`. This ensures that `nRow` will always have one additional character added to it based on the value of `i`, maintaining the integrity of `row` as well.***
