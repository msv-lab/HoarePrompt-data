According to the code, the loop will execute a total of 9 times, with `i` taking values from 0 to 8. Given that the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, we need to check its value at the end of the last iteration to determine if the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be 8 for the loop to execute again. Since `nRow` is formed by replacing every instance of '9' in `row` with '1' and `res` has `nRow` appended to it, those states do not need any adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

However, since `i` is currently at 8, to execute again, it needs to be incremented to 9, at which point the loop will terminate. Consequently, the state must be adjusted to reflect that `i` will be incremented to 9 and thus, the loop will not execute again.

State: **`nRow` is the string formed by replacing every instance of '9' in `row` with '1'; `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9**
