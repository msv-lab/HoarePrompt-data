The variable `write` is assigned the function `sys.stdout.write`, which allows for writing output to the standard output stream. The variable `t` remains unaffected, and it retains its value as a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to `write`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned sys.stdout.write**
