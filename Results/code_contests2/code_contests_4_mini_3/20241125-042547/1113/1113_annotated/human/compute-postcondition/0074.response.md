According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one character. Before the loop starts, `res` is a list containing transformed strings, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is 0, and `nRow` is an empty string. Since `i` is used as the loop variable and is initialized to 0, it will be updated to the first character in `row` during the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `row` must be a non-empty string. At the start of the loop, `i` will be assigned the first character of `row`.

State: **`res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is an empty string**
