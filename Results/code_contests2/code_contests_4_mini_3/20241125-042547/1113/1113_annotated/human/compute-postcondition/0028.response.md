According to the code, the loop will execute a total of 9 times, as defined by `range(9)`. The variable `i` will take values from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be 8, which is the last index for the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be less than 9, which is not the case since `i` is currently 8. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, `i` must be adjusted to 9. 

Since the loop's range is fixed and does not change based on any other conditions provided by `nRow` or `res`, no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the characters of `row`, where every '9' in `row` is replaced by '1'; `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9**
