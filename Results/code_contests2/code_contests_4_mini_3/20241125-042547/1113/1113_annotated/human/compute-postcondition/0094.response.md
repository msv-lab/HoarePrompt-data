According to the code, the execution of the for loop depends on the variable `row`. The loop will execute if `row` is not empty, as it iterates over each character in the string. 

Before the loop starts, `res` contains `nRow`, which is derived from `row`, `i` is initially set to 9, and `nRow` is an empty string. The state of `row` is crucial; it must contain at least one character for the loop to execute. 

To ensure the loop can run, we need to adjust the states as follows: `row` must be a non-empty string, `i` should be set to the first character in `row`, and since `nRow` is derived from `row`, it must also be non-empty.

State: **`res` contains `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character in `row`, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing '9' with '1' in `row`**
