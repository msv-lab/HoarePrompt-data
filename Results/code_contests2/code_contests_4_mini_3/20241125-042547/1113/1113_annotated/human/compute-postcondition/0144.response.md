The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` can be either '1' (if `i` was '9') or equal to the current value of `i`, after concatenation, the new value of `nRow` will either be '11' (if `i` was '9') or the string representation of `i` followed by '1' (if `i` was not '9'). The values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains a list of strings formed by replacing '9' with '1'; `i` is the next value in `row`; `nRow` is either '11' or the current value of `i` followed by '1'.

Output State: **`res` contains a list of strings formed by replacing '9' with '1'; `i` is the next value in `row`; `nRow` is either '11' or the current value of `i` followed by '1'**
