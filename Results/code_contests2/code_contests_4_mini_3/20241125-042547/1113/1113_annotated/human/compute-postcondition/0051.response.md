According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `row` variable, which is a string. The loop will iterate over each character in `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one character. The variable `i` is currently set to 8, which is not relevant to the loop since it will be overwritten by the characters of `row` during the loop execution. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to confirm that `row` contains characters, and we should also initialize `i` to the first character in `row` during the first iteration of the loop. 

State: **`row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` is updated by appending the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is the first character of `row`**
