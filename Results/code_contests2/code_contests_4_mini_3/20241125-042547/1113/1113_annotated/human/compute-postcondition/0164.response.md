The code assigns the string '1' to `nRow`, concatenating it to its previous value. The variable `nRow` is updated based on the current character `i`, but the specific previous value of `nRow` is not provided. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated by appending '1', and `res` includes the current representation of `i`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated by appending '1', `res` includes the current representation of `i`**
