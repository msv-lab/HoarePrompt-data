The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the character `'1'` to it. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it will now include the character `'1'` at the end. The variable `res`, which contains the same characters as the updated `nRow`, will also be updated to reflect this change. The variable `i` remains unchanged since the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated to include '1', `res` contains the same characters as the updated `nRow`, `i` remains unchanged**.
