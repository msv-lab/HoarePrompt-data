The code `nRow += i` increments `nRow` by the value of `i`. Since `res` contains `nRow` and `row` contains at least one more character, we can conclude that `i` is the next character in `row`. The specific values of `nRow` and `i` are not provided, but we know that `nRow` will be increased by the value of `i`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`res` contains the updated value of `nRow`, `row` contains at least one more character, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`**.
