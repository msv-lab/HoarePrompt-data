Output State: **`res` contains a list of strings with each string formed by replacing '9' with '1' from the corresponding input `row`. If there are fewer than 9 lines of input, the loop will execute only for the available lines, and `res` will contain transformed strings for those lines. If no input is provided, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains as an empty list.**
