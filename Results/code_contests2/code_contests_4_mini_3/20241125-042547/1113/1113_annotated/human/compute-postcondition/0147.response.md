According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `row`. If `row` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `row`. Since the loop is iterating over `row`, we need to adjust the state so that `i` can take the next value in the list.

However, since the specific details of `row` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact new state of `i`. We know that `i` must be adjusted to the next element in the `row`. 

Let's assume `row` has at least one more element for the loop to execute again. Therefore, if `i` was the last element of `row`, we need to ensure that `row` has more elements and that `i` points to the next element.

State: **`res` is a list of strings with '9' replaced by '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated accordingly based on the new value of `i`.**
