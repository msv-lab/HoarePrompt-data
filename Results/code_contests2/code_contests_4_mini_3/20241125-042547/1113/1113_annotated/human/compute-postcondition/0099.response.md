Postcondition: ***`res` contains `nRow`, which is formed by replacing '9' with '1' in `row`. If the first character `i` of `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to append an additional '1' at the end. If `i` is any character other than '9', then `nRow` is updated to append that character `i` to the end. Thus, `nRow` will always include the modified first character according to the specified rules.***
