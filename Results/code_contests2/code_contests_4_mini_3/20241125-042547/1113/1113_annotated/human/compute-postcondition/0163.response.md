According to the code, the loop executes based on the characters in the string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute again as long as there are more characters in `row` that have not yet been processed. The variable `i` takes on the next character in `row` for each iteration of the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` represents the current character being processed. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1' and '1' is appended to `res`. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated to the value of `i`, and `i` is appended to `res`.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to know the position of `i` in the string `row`. If `i` is the last character of the string, the loop will terminate after the current iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next character from `row`, and we need to ensure that `row` still has characters left.

Thus, if `row` has at least one more character after the current character represented by `i`, we can say that the next character will be processed, and `i` will be updated accordingly.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the current `i`, `res` includes the current representation of `i`**
