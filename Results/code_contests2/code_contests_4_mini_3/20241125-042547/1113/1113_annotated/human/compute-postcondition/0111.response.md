According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will have a value of 8 since the loop iterates from 0 to 8 (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9.

The other states, `nRow` and `res`, do not need to be adjusted since the loop's condition is solely dependent on the value of `i`.

State: **`nRow` contains the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`; `res` now has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9**
