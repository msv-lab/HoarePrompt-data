The value of `nRow` is concatenated with `i`, which means `nRow` will now hold the value of the previous `nRow` (an empty string) plus the value of `i`. Since `i` is not equal to '9', it will append `i` to `nRow`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is now equal to `i`**
