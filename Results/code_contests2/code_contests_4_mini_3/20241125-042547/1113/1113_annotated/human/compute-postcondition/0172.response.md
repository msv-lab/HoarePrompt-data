Output State: **If `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` will contain the string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged, and `res` will contain the same characters as `nRow`. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `nRow` and `res` would remain as empty strings.**
