The code `row = input().strip()` assigns a new value to `row`, taking input from the user and removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `nRow`, `res`, and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `row` now has a new input value, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`row` is a string with characters, `nRow` is a string with '9' replaced by '1', `res` is updated by appending `nRow`, `i` is 8**
