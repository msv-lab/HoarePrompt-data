The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after this operation, `nRow` will now contain the string '1'. The other variables (`res`, `i`, and `row`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '1', `res` contains the same characters as the original `nRow` (which was an empty string), `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` contains the same characters as an empty string, `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string**
