`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The current value of `nRow` is derived from `row` with '9' replaced by '1', and `i` is the first character of `row`. Since the first character of `row` is not '9', `i` retains its value, and it is concatenated to `nRow`. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character in `row`, and after execution, `nRow` is updated to include `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains the updated `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include `i`.**
