Postcondition: ***`nRow` is updated based on the character `i` from `row`. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i`. Thus, `nRow` is the concatenation of its previous value with either '1' or the value of `i`, depending on whether `i` is '9' or not.***
