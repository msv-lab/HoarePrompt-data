According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has more characters, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `T` is greater than `t`, indicating that `row` has at least three characters. However, to execute one more time, `i` needs to refer to the next character in `row`.

Since `i` is currently the third character, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be the fourth character. This means we need to ensure that `row` has at least four characters. Additionally, `nRow` will be updated based on the new value of `i`. 

Thus, the state adjustments needed are:
- `row` must have at least 4 characters.
- `i` should be the fourth character of `row`.
- The transformation logic for `nRow` will depend on the new `i`, but we don't need to specify its exact content here, only that it will be updated accordingly.

State: **`res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is the fourth character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated based on the new value of `i`.**
