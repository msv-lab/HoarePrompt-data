The code snippet `nRow += '1'` appends the character '1' to the current value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will contain the value '1'. The other variables (`row`, `res`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is '1', `res` is updated by appending the previous value of `nRow`, and `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is '1', `res` is updated by appending the previous value of `nRow`, and `i` is '9'**
