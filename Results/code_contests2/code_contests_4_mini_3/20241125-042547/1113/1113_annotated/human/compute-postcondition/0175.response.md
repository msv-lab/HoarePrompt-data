The value of `row` is assigned an input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of the affected variables are `nRow` (which is formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1' from `row`), `res` (which contains the same characters as `nRow`), and `i` (which is 9). However, the exact value of `row` is not known since it is taken from user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `row` has been assigned a new value from input, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1' from `row`, `res` contains the same characters as `nRow`, `i` is 9, and `row` is assigned a new input string.**
