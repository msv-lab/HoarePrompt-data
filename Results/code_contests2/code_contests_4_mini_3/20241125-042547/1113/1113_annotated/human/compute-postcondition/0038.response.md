The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the string `'1'` to its previous value. However, the initial value of `nRow` is unspecified, so we cannot calculate the exact new value of `nRow`. The variable `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is updated by appending '1', and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated by appending '1', and `i` is the next character in `row`**
