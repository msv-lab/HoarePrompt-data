According to the code, the for loop is set to iterate 9 times, with `i` ranging from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, the current value of `i` must be 8 for the loop to execute one more time. 

Since `i` is at its maximum value (8), for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to 9. Additionally, the loop will not execute again since it is already at the limit of its range. Therefore, there is no need to change or adjust any other states.

State: **`res` now contains `nRow`, which is the string formed by replacing '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is 9**
