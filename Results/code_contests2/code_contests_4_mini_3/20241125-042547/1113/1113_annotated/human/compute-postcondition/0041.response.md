To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided information carefully.

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The `for` loop iterates over each character `i` in the variable `row`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in `row` to iterate over.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: We know that `nRow` is updated based on the character `i` from `row`. The specific character `i` from the last iteration is not explicitly provided, but we know that it was processed and `nRow` updated accordingly.

3. **Determining the Next State**: 
   - If `row` has already been fully iterated through, the next iteration cannot occur. Thus, we need to ensure that `row` still has characters left to iterate over.
   - The loop will proceed until all characters in `row` have been processed. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is at least one more character left in `row` to iterate over.

Given this understanding, we can conclude that the state must be adjusted to reflect that we are ready to process the next character from `row`.

### Conclusion:
Since `row` should have at least one more character left for the loop to continue executing, we need to adjust it to indicate that there is at least one remaining character. 

State: **`nRow` is updated based on the character processed, `row` has at least one more character to iterate over**.
