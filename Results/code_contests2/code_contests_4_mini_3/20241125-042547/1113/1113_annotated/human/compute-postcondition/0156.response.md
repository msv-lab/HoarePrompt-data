The code assigns an empty string to `nRow`, which means that `nRow` is now an empty string. The values of the other variables (`row`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` has `nRow` appended to it, and `i` is 9.

Output State: **`row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9**
