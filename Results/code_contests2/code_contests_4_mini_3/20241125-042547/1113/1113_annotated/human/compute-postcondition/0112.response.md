The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means `row` will hold the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of `nRow` and `res` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` contains the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`; `res` now has `nRow` appended to it; `row` is an input string**.
