According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. The loop will iterate over the characters in the `row` string. For the loop to execute, `row` must not be an empty string; it must contain at least one character. 

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is still 0, and `i` will represent the index of the current character being processed in `row`. Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 0. 

To ensure that the loop is able to execute, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `row` must be a non-empty string.
- `i` should be initialized to 0, as it represents the current index in the loop.

State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string**
