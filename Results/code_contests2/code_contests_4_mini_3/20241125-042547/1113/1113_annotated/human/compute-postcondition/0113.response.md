The code snippet initializes `nRow` as an empty string. Previously, `nRow` contained a string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, and `res` had `nRow` appended to it. However, with this assignment, `nRow` is now reset to an empty string. The other variables' states remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` retains its previous value, `row` is an input string**
