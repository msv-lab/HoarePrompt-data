The variable `nRow` is being concatenated with the string `'1'`. However, the initial state does not define `nRow`, so we can only assume it exists. The value of `nRow` will depend on its previous state, which is unknown. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `nRow` is changed by appending `'1'` to it. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, `row` is a string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1'**
