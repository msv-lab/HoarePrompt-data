Postcondition: ***`res` is a list of strings with '9' replaced by '1'. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by concatenating the value of `i`. This ensures that `nRow` will always include either '1' or the original value of `i`, depending on whether `i` is '9' or not.***
