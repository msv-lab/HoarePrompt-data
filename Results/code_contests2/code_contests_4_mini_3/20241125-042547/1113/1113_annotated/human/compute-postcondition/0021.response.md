According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. The loop will execute again as long as there are more characters in `row` to iterate over. 

At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string, which means it has at least one character. Since `row` is non-empty, and `i` is currently the last character of the string, we need to adjust the state to reflect that we are now processing the next character in `row`. 

1. To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `row` has at least one more character. Therefore, we should state that `row` has at least one more character.
2. The variable `i` should be the next character in `row`, which means it should be incremented to the next character based on the length of `row`.

Assuming `row` had 3 characters at the end of the last iteration, `i` would represent the last character, and we would need to adjust `row` to reflect that we will be processing the second character next.

State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, and `row` is a string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row**
