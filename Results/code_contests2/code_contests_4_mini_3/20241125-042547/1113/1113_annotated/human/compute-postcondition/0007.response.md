According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. For the loop to execute at least once, `T` must be at least 1. The variable `t` will start at 0 when the loop begins since it is the loop variable defined in `range(T)`. 

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states to reflect that `T` is greater than 0 and `t` starts at 0.

State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than 0**
