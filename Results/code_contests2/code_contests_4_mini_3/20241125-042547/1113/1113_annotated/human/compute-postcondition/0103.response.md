Postcondition: ***`res` contains the updated `nRow`, which is modified based on the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is appended with the character `i`, where `i` is any character from `row` other than '9'. Since `row` contains at least one more character, all possible values of `i` are accounted for, ensuring `nRow` will always have one additional character after execution.***
