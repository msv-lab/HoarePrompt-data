Output State: **`nRow` contains the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop executes for each character in `row`, and `nRow` will have the same length as `row`. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string.**
