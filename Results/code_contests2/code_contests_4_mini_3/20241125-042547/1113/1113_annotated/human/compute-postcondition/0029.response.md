The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input string from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of `nRow` and `res` are not directly affected by this line of code, but it will overwrite the variable `row`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 9. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `row` based on user input while maintaining the previous values of `nRow`, `res`, and `i`.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the characters of `row`, where every '9' in `row` is replaced by '1'; `res` has `nRow` appended to it; `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string without leading or trailing whitespace**.
