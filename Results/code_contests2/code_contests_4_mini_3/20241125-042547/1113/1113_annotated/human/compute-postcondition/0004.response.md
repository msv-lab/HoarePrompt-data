The variable `maxint` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. This assignment does not affect the previous value of `t` or `write`, so the output state reflects the new assignment of `maxint` alongside the existing values of `t` and `write`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned sys.stdout.write; `maxint` is float('inf')**
