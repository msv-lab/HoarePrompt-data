The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. The previous value of `nRow` is an empty string, and since `i` is not equal to '9', it can be assumed to have some valid character value. Therefore, after executing the code, `nRow` will contain the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is `i`, `res` is updated by appending the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is not equal to '9'**
