According to the code, the for loop iterates over each character in `row`. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `i` is currently the second character of `row`. If `row` has at least 2 characters, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next character in `row`. 

Given that `i` is currently the second character, it implies that there is at least a third character in `row`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be set to the third character of `row`. Additionally, since `row` is non-empty and has at least 2 characters, we do not need to change its state. 

Thus, the updated state should reflect that `i` is now the third character of `row`.

State: **`res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters.**
