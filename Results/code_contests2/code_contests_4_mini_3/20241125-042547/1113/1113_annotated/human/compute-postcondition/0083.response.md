Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` becomes the original `i` plus '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to be the concatenation of its current value with `i`.***
