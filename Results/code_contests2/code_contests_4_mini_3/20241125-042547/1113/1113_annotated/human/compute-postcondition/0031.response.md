According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over the characters in `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must not be an empty string; it should contain at least one character. Additionally, since `i` is initialized to 9 before the loop starts, it will be overwritten by the first character of `row` during the first iteration. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `row` must be a non-empty string (containing at least one character).
- `i` will be overwritten by the first character of `row` (which is a string character).

State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` has `nRow` appended to it, `i` is overwritten by the first character of row, `row` is a non-empty string**
