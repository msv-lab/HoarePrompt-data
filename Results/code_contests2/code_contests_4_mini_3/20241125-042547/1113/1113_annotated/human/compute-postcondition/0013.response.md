The variable `nRow` is being concatenated with the string '1'. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`, so we cannot determine the specific output. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and variable `nRow` is concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and variable `nRow` is concatenated with '1'**.
