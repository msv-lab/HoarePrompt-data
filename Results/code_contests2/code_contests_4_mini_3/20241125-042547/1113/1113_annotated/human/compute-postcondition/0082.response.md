The value of `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it. Since `i` is the second character of `row`, we need to determine its numerical value based on its character representation. The output state will reflect the new value of `nRow` after this operation. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is the second character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `nRow` is now equal to `nRow + i`.**
