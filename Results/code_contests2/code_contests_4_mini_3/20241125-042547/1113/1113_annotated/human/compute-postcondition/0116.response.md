`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is an empty string, after execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The other variables, `res` and `row`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string, and the first character of `row` is '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string, and the first character of `row` is '9'**
