The code appends `nRow` to the list `res`. Since `nRow` is already defined as the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', this operation will add that string to `res`. If `row` is empty, both `nRow` and `res` are `''`, and the loop does not execute. Therefore, the output state reflects that `res` now contains `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` contains `nRow`, which is formed by replacing '9' in `row` with '1'**
