According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row`. If `row` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a string with at least 2 characters, and `i` is the first character of `row`. For the loop to be executed one more time, the character `i` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `row`. 

Since `row` has at least 2 characters, `i` should be updated to the second character of `row`, and `nRow` will be updated accordingly based on the new value of `i`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` becomes the second character of `row`.
- `nRow` will include '1' if this new `i` is '9', otherwise it will include the new `i`.

State: **`row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the new `i`**
