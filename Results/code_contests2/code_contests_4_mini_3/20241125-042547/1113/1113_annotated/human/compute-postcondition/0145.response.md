The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`. The previous value of `nRow` is either '1' (if `i` was '9') or equal to the current value of `i`. Since we do not know the exact previous value of `i`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `nRow`, but we know it will be increased by the current value of `i`. The other variable `res` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains a list of strings formed by replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next value in `row`, and `nRow` is either increased by `i` or remains the same if `i` was '9'.

Output State: **`res` contains a list of strings formed by replacing '9' with '1', `i` is the next value in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i`**
