The code snippet `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to `nRow`. The initial state indicates that `i` is the second character of `row`, which is a string with at least 2 characters. Since `nRow` is updated based on the new `i`, it will now include the second character of `row`. The previous values of the affected variables are `row` (a string), `i` (the second character of `row`), and `nRow` (which is being updated).

Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include the second character of `row`.

Output State: **`row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include the second character of `row**
