The value of `nRow` is incremented by the string `'1'`. Since `nRow` is updated accordingly based on the new value of `i`, we concatenate the string `'1'` to its current value. The other variables (`res` and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` is a list of strings with '9' replaced by '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1'**
