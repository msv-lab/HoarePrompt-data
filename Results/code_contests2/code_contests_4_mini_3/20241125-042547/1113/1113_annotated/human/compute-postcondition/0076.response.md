The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables `res`, `T`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '1'**.
