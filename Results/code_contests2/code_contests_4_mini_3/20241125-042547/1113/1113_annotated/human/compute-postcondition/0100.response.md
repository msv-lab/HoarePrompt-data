According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in `row` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` has been formed by modifying `row`, and the variable `i` represents the last character processed in `row`. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to consider the current state of `row`. If `i` is the last character of `row`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must still have characters left to process. Therefore, the character `i` needs to be adjusted to represent the next character in `row`.

If `i` is the last character of `row`, we could state that `row` should have one more character remaining, making the length of `row` at least one more than what it currently is after processing `i`.

Following this reasoning, if `i` is the last character of `row`, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now the next character in the `row`, and `row` should have at least one more character to iterate through.

State: **`res` contains `nRow`, `row` contains at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`**
