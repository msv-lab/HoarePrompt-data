The code initializes an empty list `res`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `write` is assigned sys.stdout.write, and `maxint` is float('inf'). The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `write` is assigned sys.stdout.write, `maxint` is float('inf'), and `res` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `write` is assigned sys.stdout.write, `maxint` is float('inf'), and `res` is an empty list**
