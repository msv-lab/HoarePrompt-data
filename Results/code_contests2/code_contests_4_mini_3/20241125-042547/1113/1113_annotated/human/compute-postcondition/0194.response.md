According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. Since `i` is not provided, we must assume its value is still 0 at the start of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which is not specified. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 9. 

If `i` is 8 at the end of the last iteration, then for the next iteration `i` would need to be incremented to 9, which means the loop will not execute again. Therefore, we can conclude that `i` must be 8 at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to execute one more time. 

Since `res` is formed by replacing '9' in `row` with '1', this does not affect the loop execution. Thus, the only adjustment needed is to set `i` to 8.

State: **`res` contains `nRow`, which is formed by replacing '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 8**
