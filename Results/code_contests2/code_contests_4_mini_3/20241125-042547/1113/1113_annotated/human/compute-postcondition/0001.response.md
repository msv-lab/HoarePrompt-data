The code registers a function to be called upon normal program termination, which writes the content of `sys.stdout` to the standard output (a byte stream). This means that the standard output will now contain whatever has been captured in `sys.stdout` when the program ends. The initial state of `t` and the strings in the test cases are not directly affected by this registration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding `t` and the test cases.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and each test case consists of 9 lines of strings where each string contains exactly 9 characters from '1' to '9'; the standard output is redirected to a byte stream.**
