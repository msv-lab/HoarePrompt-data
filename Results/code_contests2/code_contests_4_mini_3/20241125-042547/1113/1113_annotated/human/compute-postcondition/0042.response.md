The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the string '1' to its current value. Since `nRow` is updated based on the character processed, its previous value is not specified, but it will now be a string with '1' added at the end. The state of the variable `row` remains unaffected because it is not involved in this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is updated with '1' appended, and `row` has at least one more character to iterate over.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated with '1' appended, and `row` has at least one more character to iterate over**
