The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to the end of the string `nRow`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after this operation, `nRow` will hold the value of `i`. The variable `res` will still contain the same characters as `nRow`, which would now be equal to `i`. The variable `i` is not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state is `nRow` is now equal to `i`, `res` contains the same characters as `i`, and `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is equal to `i`, `res` contains the same characters as `i`, and `i` is not changed**
