According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one character. Since `nRow` is an empty string, it does not affect the execution of the loop. The variable `i` will take on the values of each character in `row` during the loop's execution.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `row` must be a non-empty string. The variable `i` should be set to the first character of `row` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` retains its previous value, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`**
