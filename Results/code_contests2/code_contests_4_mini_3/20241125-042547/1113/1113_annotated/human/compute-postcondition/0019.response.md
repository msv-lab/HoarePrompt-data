The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to `nRow`. The variable `nRow` is not mentioned in the initial state but is presumed to exist. The initial values of `t`, `T`, and `i` do not directly affect this operation. Therefore, we can conclude that `nRow` will now have the character `i` added to it, but without knowing its previous value, we cannot specify the exact new value of `nRow`. The output state thus reflects the operation performed.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is the next character in row, and `nRow` has the value of `nRow` plus `i`.**
