The variable `nRow` is being assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `nRow`, we can only state that it is incremented by the value of `i`, which is the next character in `row`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, `row` is a string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is incremented by `i`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, `row` is a string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is incremented by `i`**
