According to the code, the for loop will iterate a total of 9 times, with the variable `i` ranging from 0 to 8. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than 9. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be 8 (the last valid index for the loop). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9, which will cause the loop to terminate as the condition `i < 9` will no longer be satisfied. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `nRow` and `res` are not dependent on the loop's continuation but rather represent the result of the loop's operations. 

Thus, the state should reflect that `i` is now 9.

State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the characters of `row` with '9' replaced by '1'; `res` has the new value of `res` with `nRow` appended, `i` is 9**
