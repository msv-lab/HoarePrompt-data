The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the next character `i` from `row`. The initial state indicates that `res` contains the updated value of `nRow`, and `i` is the next character in `row`. Therefore, the new value of `nRow` becomes the current value of `nRow` concatenated with the character `i`. The states of `res`, `i`, and `row` are not directly affected by this operation, but `nRow` changes.

Output State: **`res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains at least one more character; `nRow` is updated with `i`**
