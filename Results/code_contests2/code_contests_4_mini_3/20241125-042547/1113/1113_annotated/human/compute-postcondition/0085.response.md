The variable `nRow` is being concatenated with the string `'1'`. However, the initial state does not provide any value for `nRow`, so we cannot determine its previous value or state. The transformation affects only `nRow`, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row`, `T` is greater than `t`, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is concatenated with '1'**
