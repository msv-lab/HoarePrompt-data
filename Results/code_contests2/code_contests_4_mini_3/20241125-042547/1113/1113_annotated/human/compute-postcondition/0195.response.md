Output State: **`res` contains a list of strings formed by replacing every instance of '9' with '1' from the corresponding input `row` for each of the 9 iterations. If the loop executes less than 9 times, `res` will contain only the strings from the executed iterations, and the loop will not execute if the input mechanism fails or if it is interrupted before completion. If the input is provided correctly, `res` will have exactly 9 entries, and each entry corresponds to the processed string from each iteration.**
