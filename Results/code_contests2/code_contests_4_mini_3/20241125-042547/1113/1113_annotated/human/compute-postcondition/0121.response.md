`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. The exact previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it will now be a string with '1' appended to it. The values of `res` and `row` remain unchanged, with `row` being a non-empty string that does not start with '9'. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is equal to the next value of `i` concatenated with '1', `res` retains its previous value, and `row` remains a non-empty string with its first character not being '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is equal to the next value of `i` concatenated with '1', `res` retains its previous value, `row` remains a non-empty string with its first character not being '9'**
