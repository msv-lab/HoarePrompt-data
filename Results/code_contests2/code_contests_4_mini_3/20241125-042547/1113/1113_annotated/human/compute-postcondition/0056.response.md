Postcondition: ***`row` is a string with at least 1 character. If the first character `i` of `row` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1' and `res` is appended with the previous value of `nRow`. If `i` is any character other than '9', then `nRow` is updated to `i` and `res` is appended with the previous value of `nRow`.***
