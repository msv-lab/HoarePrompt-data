The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`, but the initial value of `nRow` is unknown. The variables `t`, `T`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is increased by `i`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is increased by `i**
