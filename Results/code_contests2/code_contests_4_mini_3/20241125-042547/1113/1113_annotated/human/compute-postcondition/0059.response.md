The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the first character of the string `row`. The initial value of `nRow` is unknown, but it will be updated to include the first character of `row`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `nRow` has been updated to include `i`.

Output State: **`row` is a string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `nRow` has been updated to include `i`**
