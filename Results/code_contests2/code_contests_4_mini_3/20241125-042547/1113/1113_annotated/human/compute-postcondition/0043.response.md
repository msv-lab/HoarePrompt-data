The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`, but the previous value of `nRow` is unknown as it is updated based on the character processed, and `i` is also unknown since it depends on the context of the iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is updated based on the character processed, and `row` has at least one more character to iterate over.
