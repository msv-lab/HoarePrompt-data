Output State: **`res` is a list containing the transformed strings for each `row` input, where every '9' in each `row` is replaced by '1'. If `row` is an empty string for any iteration, `nRow` will be an empty string, and `res` will remain unchanged for that iteration. If the loop is executed 0 times (if `T` is 0 or less), then `res` will remain uninitialized or empty.**
