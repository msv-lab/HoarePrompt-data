The variable `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, but we do not know the specific input value for `T`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between `t` and `T` without specifying exact integers.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `T` is an input integer**
