The variable `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` can either be '1' or the value of the next character in `row`, after this operation, `nRow` will either be '11' (if it was '1') or the value of the next character in `row` followed by '1'. The values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is either '11' or the next character in `row` followed by '1'; `res` retains its previous value; `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '11' or the next character in `row` followed by '1'; `res` retains its previous value; `i` is the next character in `row`**
