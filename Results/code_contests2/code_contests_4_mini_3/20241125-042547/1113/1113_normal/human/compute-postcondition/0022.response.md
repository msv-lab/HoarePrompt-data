The code `nRow += '1'` attempts to concatenate the string `'1'` to the existing value of `nRow`. Given that `nRow` is initially defined as an integer (the length of `row` minus 1), this operation would result in a type error in a typical Python execution context since you cannot concatenate a string to an integer directly. However, since the task does not include any error handling or type checking, we will simply consider the operation as it is.

Thus, after the operation:
- `nRow` would be treated as a string that now has the value of its previous integer value followed by the string `'1'`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `nRow` (only that it is equal to the length of `row` minus 1), we cannot determine the specific output value of `nRow`, but we know it will now be a string.

Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to `nRow`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next character in `row` after the current character, `nRow` is the string representation of its previous integer value concatenated with '1'**
