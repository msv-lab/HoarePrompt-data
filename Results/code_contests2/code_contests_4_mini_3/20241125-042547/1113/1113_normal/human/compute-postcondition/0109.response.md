Output State: **`nRow` will be a string that replaces every '9' in `row` with '1' while retaining all other characters unchanged. If `row` contains no characters, the loop will not execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string. If `row` contains characters other than '9', `nRow` will contain those characters as they appear. The value of `res` retains its previous value throughout the execution.**
