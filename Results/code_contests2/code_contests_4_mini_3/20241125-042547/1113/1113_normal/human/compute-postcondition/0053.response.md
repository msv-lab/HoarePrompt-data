The value of `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it. Since `nRow` was initially an empty string, after appending '1', `nRow` will now be '1'. The values of `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `res` has been updated by appending the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` has been updated by appending the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string**
