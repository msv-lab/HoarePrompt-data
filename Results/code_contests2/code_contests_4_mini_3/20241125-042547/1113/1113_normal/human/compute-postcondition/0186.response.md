Postcondition: ***`res` is updated to include `nRow`, which is modified based on the second character `i` of the non-empty string `row`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to include '1'; otherwise, `nRow` is updated to include the value of `i`. Thus, `nRow` will either have '1' appended if `i` is '9' or have the second character `i` appended if it is any other character.***
