The value of `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous value of `nRow` was a string that replaced every '9' in `row` with '1', but now it is reset to an empty string. The values of the other variables (`res`, `i`, and `row`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is an empty string, `res` is updated to append the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string.

Output State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` is updated to append the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is an input string**
