Postcondition: ***`res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is the original value concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is the original value concatenated with `i`, so that `nRow` reflects the addition of either '1' or the character `i` from `row`.***
