The value of `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value. If `i` is '9', `nRow` would change from '11' to '111'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` will be the concatenation of its previous value with '1'. The value of `res` remains unchanged, and since `row` contains at least three elements, its state is also unaffected.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '111' if `i` is '9', or the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1' if `i` is not '9'; `res` retains the previous value; `row` contains at least three elements.**
