The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string `'1'` to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution of this line, `nRow` will become `'1'`. The values of the other variables (`res`, `T`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `i` is equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is '1'**
