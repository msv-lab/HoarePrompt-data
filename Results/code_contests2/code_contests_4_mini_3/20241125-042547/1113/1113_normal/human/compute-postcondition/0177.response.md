According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates through each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character. 

Given the current state where `row` is the user input string, if `row` is an empty string, the loop will not execute. Therefore, `row` needs to be adjusted to ensure it contains at least one character. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will represent the first character in the string `row`. If `row` is non-empty, `i` should be set to the first character of that string.

State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`, `nRow` is an empty string**
