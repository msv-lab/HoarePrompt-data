The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the next character in the updated `row`. Since `nRow` was previously defined and `i` holds a character, `nRow` will be extended by this character. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions; `row` is a string with at least one additional character; `i` is the next character in the updated `row`; `nRow` is updated to hold the new value.

Output State: **`res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions; `row` is a string with at least one additional character; `i` is the next character in the updated `row`; `nRow` is updated to hold the new value.**
