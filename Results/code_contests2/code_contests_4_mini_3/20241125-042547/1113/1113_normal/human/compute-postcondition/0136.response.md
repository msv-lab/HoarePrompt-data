The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The values of `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions, `i` is 0, `row` is the input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions, `i` is 0, `row` is the input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string**.
