The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The values of `res`, `row`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is now the user input string, `i` is 9, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is now the user input string, `i` is 9, and `nRow` is an empty string**
