Output State: **`nRow` contains a string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', and appending all other characters from `row` unchanged. `res` contains the previous value of `nRow` before each update. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string, while `res` also remains unchanged.**
