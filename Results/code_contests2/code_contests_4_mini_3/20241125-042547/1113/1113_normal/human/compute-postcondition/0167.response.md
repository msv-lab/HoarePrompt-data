According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. The loop will execute again as long as there are more characters in `row` for `i` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means that the loop has processed the character '9'. In the next iteration, `i` would need to be the next character in `row`. Since `nRow` was updated to include '1' when `i` was '9', it suggests that '1' is now a part of `nRow`, but we must also ensure that `row` still has characters remaining to iterate over.

To execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `row` contains characters after '9'. If `row` had characters beyond '9', then `i` would be the next character after '9'.

Thus, we must indicate that `row` remains a non-empty string, and that `i` now represents the next character in `row` following '9'.

State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string with characters following '9', and `i` is the next character in `row`**
