According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. The loop will iterate over the elements in `row`, and it will execute again if there are more elements in `row` than have already been processed.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `row` contains at least two elements. The variable `i` represents the current element being processed in the loop. Since `i` takes values from `row`, we need to determine the state of `i` and how many elements are left in `row` after the last iteration.

Given that the loop processes each element in `row`, if `row` has two elements initially, after one iteration, `i` would take the first element, and the next iteration would process the second element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least three elements. As `i` would be the second element in the case of two elements, we can conclude that `i` must now be the second element, and we can assume the next value of `i` (for the next iteration) will be the third element.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- Maintain `nRow` in its current state since it does not affect the loop execution.
- Keep `res` unchanged as per the problem statement.
- For the loop to run again, `row` needs to have at least three elements.

State: **`nRow` is a string that contains either '11' if `i` is '9', or the concatenation of its previous value and `i` if `i` is not '9', `res` retains the previous value, `row` contains at least three elements.**
