The code attempts to add the string `'1'` to the variable `nRow`, which is initially an integer equal to the length of the string `row`. This operation will cause a type error since concatenating a string to an integer is not allowed in Python. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged, but the operation itself is invalid.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next character in row, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `nRow` is equal to the length of `row`, but an error occurs when trying to execute `nRow += '1'` due to type incompatibility.**
