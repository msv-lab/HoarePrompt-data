Postcondition: ***`res` is updated to include `nRow`, where if `i` is equal to the string '9', then `nRow` becomes '1', otherwise if `i` is any other string, `nRow` becomes the value of `i`. In either case, `row` remains a non-empty string, and `nRow` will either be '1' or the string representation of `i`.***
