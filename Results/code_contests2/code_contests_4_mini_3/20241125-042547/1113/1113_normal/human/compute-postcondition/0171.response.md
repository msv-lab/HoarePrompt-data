According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row` variable. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`, and since `row` remains a non-empty string with characters following '9', the loop can execute again as long as `row` still has characters left.

Since `i` is being updated to the next character in `row` with each iteration, to execute one more time, `i` will need to be set to the character that follows the current character in `row`. Additionally, `row` must still be non-empty after the current character.

Thus, if `row` originally has characters following '9', it must retain those characters for the loop to continue executing. 

State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string with characters following '9', and `i` is the next character in `row`.**
