The variable `nRow` is initialized as an empty string. The state of `res`, `i`, and `row` is not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the new state of `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, which is constructed from `row`; `i` is 9, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace; `nRow` is an empty string**
