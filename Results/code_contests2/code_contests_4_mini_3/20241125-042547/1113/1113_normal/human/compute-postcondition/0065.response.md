According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `row`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are remaining characters in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is updated based on the character `i`, and `row` has at least one character remaining, which means the loop can execute again. 

Since `row` has characters remaining and `i` represents the current character being processed, for the loop to be executed one more time, `row` must have at least one more character left. This means that `i` will take the next character in `row`, and the state of `nRow` will be updated accordingly based on that new character.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is one fewer character in `row`, and `i` should represent the next character in the sequence. 

State: **`nRow` is updated based on the next character in `row`, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` has at least one character remaining**
