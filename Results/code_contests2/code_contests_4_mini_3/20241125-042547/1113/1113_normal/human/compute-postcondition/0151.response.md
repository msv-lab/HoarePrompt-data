According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least one more character, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means that `nRow` was set to the original value concatenated with '1'. 

To execute one more time, `i` needs to take on the next character in `row`. Since `i` is currently '9', we can infer that there is at least one more character after '9' in `row` for the loop to continue. Thus, `i` would need to be set to the next character in `row` and `nRow` would need to reflect this change.

State: **`res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is the original value concatenated with `i`**
