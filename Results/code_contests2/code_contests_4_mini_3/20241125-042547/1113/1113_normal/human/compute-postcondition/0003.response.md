The variable `write` is assigned the method `sys.stdout.write`, which does not alter the values of `t` or `input`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the assignment of `write`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `input` is assigned to read a line from the input buffer, and `write` is assigned sys.stdout.write**
