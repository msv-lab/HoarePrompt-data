The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous values of other variables (`res`, `T`, `i`, and `row`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables along with the new value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string, and `nRow` is an empty string**.
