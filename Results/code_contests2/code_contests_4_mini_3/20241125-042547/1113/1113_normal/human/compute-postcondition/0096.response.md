The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the operation, `nRow` will be '1'. The values of `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '1', `res` still includes the previous value, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty iterable.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` still includes the previous value, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty iterable**
