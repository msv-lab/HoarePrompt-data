The value of `nRow` is incremented by the string `'1'`. The variable `i` is equal to '9', and other variables like `res` and `row` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions, `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'.

Output State: **`res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` has been updated by adding '1'**
