The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`, but since the previous value of `nRow` is equal to the length of `row` minus 1, and `i` is the next character in `row`, the specific value of `i` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i`**
