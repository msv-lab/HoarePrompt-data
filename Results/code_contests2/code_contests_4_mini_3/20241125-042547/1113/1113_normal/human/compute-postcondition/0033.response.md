The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1', resulting in `nRow` being assigned the value '1'. The previous value of `nRow` was an empty string. The states of the other variables (`res`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `res` contains the previous value, `i` is '9', and `row` contains at least 1 element.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` contains the previous value, `i` is '9', `row` contains at least 1 element**
