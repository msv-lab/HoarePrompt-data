According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `row`. If `row` contains at least four elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `row` contains at least three elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least four elements, and `i` will take the next value from `row`.

However, since the specific value of `i` is not provided, I cannot determine what `i` will be in the next iteration. Therefore, I will set `i` to the next value in `row`, which will be the fourth element of `row` (assuming `row` has at least four elements).

State: **`nRow` is updated to either '11' if `i` is '9' or the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with `i`, `res` retains its previous value, `row` contains at least 4 elements, and `i` is the fourth element in the `row`**
