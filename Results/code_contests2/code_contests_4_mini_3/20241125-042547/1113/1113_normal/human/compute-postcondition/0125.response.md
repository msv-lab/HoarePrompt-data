The value of `nRow` is incremented by the string '1', which means the new value of `nRow` will be the previous value concatenated with '1'. The variable `row` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation, and `i` also remains unchanged as it is not directly modified. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow` while maintaining the previous states of `row` and `i`.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated based on the character currently being processed; `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character left; `i` is the next character in the string `row`.**
