The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating its previous value with `i`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` becomes '11'. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` retains its previous value and appends `i` to it. The variables `res` and `row` are not affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the changes based on the conditions regarding `i`.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `res` retains the previous value, `row` contains at least three elements**
