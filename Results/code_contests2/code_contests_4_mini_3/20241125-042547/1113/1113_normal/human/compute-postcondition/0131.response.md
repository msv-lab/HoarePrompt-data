According to the code, the loop will execute a total of 9 times, with the variable `i` ranging from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be 8 for the loop to have completed its last execution. Since `i` is incremented after each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 9, and the loop will stop executing because the range is from 0 to 8.

Additionally, since the loop has reached its final iteration, there's no further need to adjust other states related to `nRow` or `res` that were updated during the loop body.

State: **`nRow` contains a string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', and appending all other characters from `row` unchanged; `res` is updated to include the current value of `nRow`, `i` is 9**
