According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over `row`, so for the loop to execute, `row` must be a non-empty string. Since `row` is currently an input string after stripping whitespace and `nRow` is an empty string, it is important to ensure that `row` has at least 1 character. The variable `i` will take on the value of each character in `row` during the iterations.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to verify that `row` is not empty, and since `i` is already initialized to 9 (which does not affect the loop execution), we can leave it as it is.

State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string**
