Output State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the characters from `row`, with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'. If `row` is non-empty, the loop will execute for each character in `row`, updating `nRow` accordingly. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string.**
