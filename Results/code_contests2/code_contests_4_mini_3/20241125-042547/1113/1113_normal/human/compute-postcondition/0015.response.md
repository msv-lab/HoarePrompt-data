The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string and `i` is not equal to '9', the value of `nRow` will be updated to be equal to the string representation of `i`. The other variables `t`, `T`, and `row` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` has been updated to include the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is now equal to `i`**
