The value of `nRow` is updated to include `i`, which is the first character of `row` that is not '9'. Since `nRow` was initially an empty string, after executing `nRow += i`, `nRow` will now contain the value of `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row` which is not '9', and `nRow` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row` which is not '9', and `nRow` is now equal to `i`**
