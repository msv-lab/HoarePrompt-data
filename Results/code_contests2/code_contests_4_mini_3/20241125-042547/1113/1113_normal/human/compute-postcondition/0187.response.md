According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `row`. The loop will continue to iterate as long as there are characters left in `row`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` has been updated based on the second character `i` of the string `row`. Since `i` is the current character in the iteration, to execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more character in `row` after the current character.

If we denote the current character `i` as `row[index]`, to execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state to reflect that we are now at the next character, which would be `row[index + 1]`. 

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
1. The character `i` should be the next character in `row`.
2. The `nRow` should be updated accordingly based on whether the next character is '9' or not.

Thus, if we assume the length of `row` is greater than the current index, we need to ensure that there is one more character to iterate over.

State: **`res` is updated to include the next character of `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the next character of `row`, `i` is the next character in `row`**
