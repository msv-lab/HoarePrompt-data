The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the string '1' to it. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it is not affected by the other variables. The value of `row` remains unchanged as it is a non-empty string with characters following '9', and `i` retains its value as the next character in `row`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string with characters following '9', `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string with characters following '9', `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'**
