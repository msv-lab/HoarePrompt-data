The code assigns the value of `i` (which is the 10th character in `row`) to `nRow` and concatenates it to the current value of `nRow`. However, the initial value of `nRow` is not provided, so we cannot determine its previous state. The value of `i` is known as it is the 10th character in `row`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `nRow` is updated with the character `i`, without specifying the initial value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `row` contains at least 10 characters, `i` is the 10th character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` to its previous value.**
