The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It is designed to process multiple test cases, where the first input indicates the number of test cases `t`. Each test case consists of 9 lines, with each line containing 9 characters, where each character is a digit from '1' to '9'. The function will process these test cases and return results based on the conditions defined within the function. The specific return value is not detailed in the provided output information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle multiple test cases consisting of 9 lines of 9 digits each, where `t` indicates the number of test cases, and provide corresponding results based on the input data.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases consisting of 9 lines with 9 digits each, where the number of test cases is specified by an integer `t` in the range 1 to 10,000.**
