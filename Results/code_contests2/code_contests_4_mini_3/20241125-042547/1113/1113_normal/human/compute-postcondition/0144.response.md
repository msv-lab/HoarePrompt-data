The variable `nRow` is being modified by appending the string '1' to its current value. The initial values of `res` and `row` are not directly affected by this operation, but we can note that `nRow` will now include an additional character '1'. The value of `i` is not modified either. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `nRow` after the append operation while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions, `row` is a string with at least one additional character, `i` is the next character in the updated `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'.**
