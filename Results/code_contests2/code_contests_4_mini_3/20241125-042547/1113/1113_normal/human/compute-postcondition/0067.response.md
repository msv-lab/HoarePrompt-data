The code snippet appends `nRow` to `res`. Since `nRow` is the result of processing `row` (which is defined as appending '1' for each occurrence of '9' and keeping all other characters unchanged), if `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string. Therefore, appending an empty string to `res` does not change its value.

Output State: **`nRow` is the result of processing `row`, `res` remains unchanged after appending `nRow`.**
