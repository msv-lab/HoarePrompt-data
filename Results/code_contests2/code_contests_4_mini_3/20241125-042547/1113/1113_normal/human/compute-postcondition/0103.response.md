Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '11' or the next character in `row` followed by '1'. If `i` is any character other than '9', then `nRow` is either '1' concatenated with `i` or the next character in `row` concatenated with `i`. The value of `res` retains its previous value, and `i` is the next character in `row`.***
