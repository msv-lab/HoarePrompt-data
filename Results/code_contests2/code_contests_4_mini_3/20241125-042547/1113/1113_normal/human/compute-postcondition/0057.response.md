To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the current state based on the provided description.

1. The loop is iterating over `row`, which is a non-empty string. This means that as long as `row` has characters left to iterate over, the loop can continue executing.

2. The variable `i` represents the current character in `row` during each iteration. The previous value of `i` will dictate the next iteration. If `i` was '9', then `nRow` was set to '1'. For any other value of `i`, `nRow` was updated by appending `i` to its previous value.

3. After the last iteration, if `row` has more characters left, `i` would take on the next character in `row`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `row` has not been completely iterated over. 

4. Since `row` is a non-empty string, if it has been partially iterated, the next value of `i` will be the next character in the string, and the state of `row` would need to reflect that it has one less character available.

5. The variable `nRow` would not need to be adjusted unless we know the exact previous value of `i`. However, we can deduce that if `i` is not '9', it would append to `nRow`, and if it is '9', it would reset `nRow` to '1'.

To summarize, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` will take on the next character in `row`, and `row` would have one less character available.

State: **`nRow` remains unchanged, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` has one less character**
