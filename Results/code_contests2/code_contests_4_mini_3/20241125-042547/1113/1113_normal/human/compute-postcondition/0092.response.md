The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it takes input from the user and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of `nRow` and `res` are not affected by this input operation, and `i` retains its value of 9. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is a string that contains the characters from `row` with '9' replaced by '1'; `res` still includes `nRow` appended to it; `i` is 9.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the characters from `row` with '9' replaced by '1'; `res` still includes `nRow` appended to it; `i` is 9**
