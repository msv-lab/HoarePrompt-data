Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is a string representation of its previous integer value concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is a string representation of its previous integer value concatenated with the character `i`, which is the next character in `row`.***
