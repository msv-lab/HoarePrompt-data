The value of `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take input from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous value of `nRow` is not affected by this change, and `res` still contains the value of `nRow` appended to it. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 9. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is a string that contains the characters from `row` with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1', `res` contains `nRow` appended to it, and `i` is 9.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the characters from `row` with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1', `res` contains `nRow` appended to it, and `i` is 9**
