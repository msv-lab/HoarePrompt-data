The variable `nRow` is assigned the value `nRow + '1'`, which means that the string `'1'` is concatenated to the current value of `nRow`. The initial state does not provide the current value of `nRow`, but we know it will now include the character '1' at the end. The other variables `res`, `T`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'**.
