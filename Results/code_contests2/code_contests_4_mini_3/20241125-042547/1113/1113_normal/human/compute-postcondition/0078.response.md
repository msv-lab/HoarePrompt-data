The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, concatenating an integer `i` (which is not equal to 9) to it will result in `nRow` being the string representation of `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `i` is an integer not equal to 9, `row` is a non-empty input string, and `nRow` is the string representation of `i`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `i` is an integer not equal to 9, `row` is a non-empty input string, and `nRow` is the string representation of `i`**
