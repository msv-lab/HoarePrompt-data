The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, which means the string '1' is appended to the existing value of `nRow`. However, the initial state does not mention what `nRow` is, so we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `row` contains at least 10 characters, `i` is the 10th character in `row`, and '1' is appended to `nRow`.**
