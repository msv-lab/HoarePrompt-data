Output State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the characters from `row`, with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute and `nRow` remains an empty string. If `row` contains any non-string characters, there could be a type mismatch issue when concatenating with `nRow`. If all characters are '9', `nRow` will be composed only of '1's, and its length will equal the number of '9's in `row`. If `row` contains at least one character that is not '9', `nRow` will contain those characters in their original form, with '9's replaced by '1's.**
