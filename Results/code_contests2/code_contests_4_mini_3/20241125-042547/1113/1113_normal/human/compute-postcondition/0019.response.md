The expression `nRow += i` attempts to add the character `i` (which is a string) to the integer value of `nRow` (which is equal to the length of `row`). This operation is invalid because you cannot add a string to an integer in Python. Therefore, while the value of `t` remains 0 and `T` is greater than or equal to 1, the operation will raise an error and no valid output state can be generated.

Output State: **An error occurs due to invalid operation: cannot add a string to an integer**
