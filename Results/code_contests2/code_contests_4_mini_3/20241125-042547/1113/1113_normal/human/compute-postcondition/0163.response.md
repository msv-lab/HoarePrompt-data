According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as there are more characters in the string `row` to iterate over. The variable `i` takes on each character in `row` during the iterations. Since `row` is a non-empty string at the end of the last iteration, we need to determine the current state of `i` and the length of `row`.

Given that `i` is the current character being processed from `row`, to execute the loop one more time, `i` must be less than the total number of characters in `row`. If `i` is the last character of `row`, it will not execute again unless there are more characters to process.

Since `nRow` will become '1' if `i` is equal to '9', and will otherwise become the string representation of `i`, we need to ensure that `row` still contains more characters for the loop to execute again. 

To adjust the state for the next iteration:
- `row` must still be a non-empty string.
- The next value of `i` should be the next character in `row`.
- If `i` was the last character of `row`, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` should now be the first character of `row` again (if wrapping around) or just the next character in sequence.

Since we know that `row` is still non-empty and we need to continue iterating, we can assume that `i` can be incremented to represent the next character in `row`.

State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, where `row` remains a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
