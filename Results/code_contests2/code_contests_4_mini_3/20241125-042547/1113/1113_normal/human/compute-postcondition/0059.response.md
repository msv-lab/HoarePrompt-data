The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is the next character in `row`. The previous value of `nRow` remains unchanged, and `row` has one less character, but this does not affect the current operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` remains unchanged, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `row` has one less character.

Output State: **`nRow` remains unchanged, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` has one less character**
