The value of `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which accepts an input string and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The variable `res` is updated to include a value derived from `row`, but its exact value isn't affected by the current line of code. The variable `i` remains unchanged with a value of 9. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated to include `nRow`, which is constructed from `row`; `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, which is constructed from `row`; `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace**
