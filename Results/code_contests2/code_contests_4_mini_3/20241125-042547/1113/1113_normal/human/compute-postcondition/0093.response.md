The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous value of `nRow`, which contained characters from `row` with '9' replaced by '1', is overridden and lost. The states of the other variables (`res` and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is an empty string, `res` still includes the previous value, and `i` is 9.

Output State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` still includes the previous value, and `i` is 9**
