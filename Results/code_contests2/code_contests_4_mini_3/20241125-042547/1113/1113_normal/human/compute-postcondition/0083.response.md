Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, after executing the program fragment, `nRow` is updated to include '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is updated to include the value of `i`. This means if `i` is not '9', `nRow` will contain the original value plus the character represented by `i`, ensuring that `nRow` remains a string that reflects the characters processed from `row`.***
