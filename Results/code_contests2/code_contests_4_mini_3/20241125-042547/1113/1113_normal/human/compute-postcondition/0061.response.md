According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. If `row` still has at least one character left, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', and `nRow` is updated to append '1', which means that the next character in `row` has been processed, and `row` now has one less character. To execute the loop one more time, `row` must have at least one more character left for iteration.

Thus, since `i` was '9', it indicates that the next character in `row` must be processed, and `nRow` should be updated accordingly for the next character.

State: **`nRow` is updated to append the character that follows '9' in `row`, `row` has at least one character remaining.**
