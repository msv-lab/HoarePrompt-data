According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `i`, which goes from 0 to 8 (inclusive) for a total of 9 iterations. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be 8, which is the last valid index for the loop to execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9. Since the loop condition is based solely on `i` being less than 9, the state of `nRow` and `res` does not influence the continuation of the loop as they do not affect the loop's termination condition.

Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to 9.

State: **`nRow` is the result of processing `row`, `res` remains unchanged after appending `nRow`, `i` is 9**
