Output State: **`nRow` is constructed by replacing each occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1' while retaining all other characters unchanged. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute for each character in `row`, resulting in `nRow` being a string of the same length as `row`. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string. Additionally, `res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions.**
