Postcondition: ***`res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions. When `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to include '1'. For any other character in `i`, `nRow` is updated to include that character, ensuring `nRow` reflects the addition of either '1' or the character `i` from `row`.***
