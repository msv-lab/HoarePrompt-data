According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9, which would cause the loop to terminate. Therefore, to allow for one more iteration, we need to adjust `i` to 8 and clarify that the loop will not execute again since `i` will equal 9 after this adjustment.

No other states need to be adjusted since `nRow` and `res` do not affect the loop condition. 

State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the concatenation of elements from `row`, with each occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'; `res` is updated by appending `nRow`, `i` is 8**
