The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to the end of the string stored in `nRow`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after this operation, `nRow` will hold the value of `i`. The state of the other variables (`res`, `row`) is not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is the value of `i`, `res` has been updated to append the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is not equal to '9', and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is the value of `i`, `res` has been updated to append the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is not equal to '9', and `row` is a non-empty string.**
