According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. The loop will execute again if there are more characters in `row` for `i` to take. At the end of the last iteration, `row` contains at least 10 characters, and `i` is the 10th character in `row`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least 11 characters, and `i` should then be the 11th character in `row`.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `row` contains at least 11 characters, and `i` is the 11th character in `row`.**
