According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row` variable, specifically on its length and the current position indicated by the loop variable `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means the next loop iteration would involve the character immediately following '9' in `row`. 

If `i` is '9', `nRow` has been updated to include '1', and `res` has been updated to include the character after '9'. For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to be determined what the next character in `row` is after '9'. 

If `row` has more characters after '9', `i` should be updated to that next character, and we need to ensure that the character at that position is processed accordingly.

If `i` is any character other than '9', `nRow` is updated to include that character, and `res` is also updated to include the next character of `row`. 

To summarize, if the loop is to execute one more time, it must have a valid next character in `row` and the updated states need to reflect that character being processed.

State: **`nRow` includes '1' and the next character of `row`, `res` includes the next character of `row`, `i` is the next character in `row` after '9'**
