According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `T`. The loop will execute if `t` is less than `T`. At the end of the last iteration, it has executed 9 times, which means `t` is 9. For the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be greater than 9.

No other states need to be adjusted since `res` already contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions, and the loop's focus is solely on the variable `T`.

State: **`res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions, `T` is greater than 9, `t` is 9**
