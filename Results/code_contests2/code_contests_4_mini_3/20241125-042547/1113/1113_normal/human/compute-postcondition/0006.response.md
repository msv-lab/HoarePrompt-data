`T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` reads a line from the input buffer and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `t` is within the range of 1 to 10^4, but its specific value is not mentioned here. The other variables (`input`, `write`, `maxint`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `input` is assigned to read a line from the input buffer; `write` is assigned sys.stdout.write; `maxint` is float('inf'); `res` is an empty list; `T` is assigned the value of int(input())**
