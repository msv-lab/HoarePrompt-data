Postcondition: ***`nRow` remains unchanged or is updated to include '1'. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to append '1', otherwise, `nRow` is updated to append the character `i`, which is the next character in `row`. In all cases, `row` has one less character and `i` is the next character from `row`.***
