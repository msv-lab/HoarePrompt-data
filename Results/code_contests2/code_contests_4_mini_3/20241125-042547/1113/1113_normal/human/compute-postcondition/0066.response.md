Output State: **`nRow` is the result of appending '1' for each occurrence of '9' in `row`, and all other characters in `row` are appended unchanged. `res` holds the final value of `nRow` after processing all characters in `row`. If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string, while `res` also remains unchanged.**
