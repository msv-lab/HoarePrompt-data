The statement assigns `float('inf')` to `maxint`, which represents positive infinity in Python. This operation does not affect the previously defined variables `t`, `input`, or `write`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding those variables but now includes the new value of `maxint`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `input` is assigned to read a line from the input buffer; `write` is assigned sys.stdout.write; `maxint` is float('inf')**
