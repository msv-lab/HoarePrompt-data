The variable `nRow` is updated by appending the current value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, the new value of `nRow` will be equal to `i`. The variable `i` is still 0, so after this operation, `nRow` will be '0'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '0', `res` still includes the previous value, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty iterable, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is '0', `res` still includes the previous value, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty iterable, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
