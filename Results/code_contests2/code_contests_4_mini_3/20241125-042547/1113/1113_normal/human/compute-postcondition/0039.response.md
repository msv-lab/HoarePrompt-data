The variable `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. The value of `i` can either be '9' or some other value. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` will become '1' + '9' (resulting in '19'). If `i` is not '9', it will append the value of `i` directly to `nRow`. The variable `res` remains unchanged, and `row` also remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the possible new values of `nRow` based on the condition of `i`.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '19' (if `i` is '9') or `nRow` + `i` (if `i` is not '9'); `res` contains the previous value; `row` contains at least two elements**
