The value of `nRow` is appended with '1'. Since `nRow` originally is either '1' (if `i` is '9') or the value of `i` (if `i` is not '9'), the new value of `nRow` will be `nRow + '1'`. The values of `res` and `row` remain unchanged, but `nRow` changes based on its previous content.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '11' (if `i` is '9') or `i` + '1' (if `i` is not '9'); `res` contains the previous value; `row` contains at least two elements**
