According to the code, the loop iterates over `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one element. Since `nRow` is an empty string, it does not contribute to the loop execution, and `i` is currently set to 9. However, `i` will be overwritten by the loop variable during the execution. 

To ensure that the loop can execute, the state needs to reflect that `row` contains at least one element, and `i` should be set to the first element of `row` during the initial execution.

State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the previous value, `i` is the first element of row, `row` contains at least 1 element**
