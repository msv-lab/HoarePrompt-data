According to the code, the for loop executes a fixed number of times, specifically 9 iterations (from 0 to 8), since it is defined as `for i in range(9):`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop will have completed all its iterations when `i` reaches 8.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 with each iteration and starts from 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be less than 9. However, after the last iteration, `i` would be 9, which means the loop cannot execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `nRow` and `res` are not relevant to the loop's termination condition.

State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the characters from `row`, with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1', and `res` now contains `nRow` appended to it, `i` is 9**
