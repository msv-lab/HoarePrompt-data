Postcondition: ***`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`; if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1' and `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`, while if `i` is any other value, `nRow` is updated to that value of `i` and `res` still contains the previous value of `nRow`. In both cases, `row` remains a non-empty string.***
