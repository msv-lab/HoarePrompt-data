The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string `'1'` to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after this operation, `nRow` will contain `'1'`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `T`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1'**
