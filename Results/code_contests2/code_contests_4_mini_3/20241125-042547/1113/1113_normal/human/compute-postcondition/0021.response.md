According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`, which is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `nRow` is equal to the length of `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must point to the next character in `row` after the current character. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is updated to the next character in `row`, which means `nRow` should be adjusted accordingly to reflect the remaining length of `row`. 

Since `row` has at least 2 characters, after processing one character (i.e., `i`), `nRow` should be decreased by 1. 

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted so that `nRow` is one less than its current value, and `i` must be the next character in the string `row`. 

State: **`t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next character in `row` after the current character, `nRow` is equal to the length of `row` minus 1**
