According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row` variable. If `row` has at least one more element after the current iteration, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either '9' or another character (not '9'), and `nRow` is updated accordingly. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '1'. If `i` is any other character, `nRow` is updated to that character.

Since `i` can be '9' or any other character, we need to consider the next value of `i` in the `row` for the next iteration. Therefore, if the loop is to execute again, we must ensure that `row` has at least one more character after the current value of `i`.

Assuming that `row` has more elements remaining, we need to adjust the state of `nRow` based on the next value of `i`, and since `res` remains unchanged, it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`nRow` is either '1' or the value of the next character in `row`, `res` retains its previous value, `i` is the next character in `row`**
