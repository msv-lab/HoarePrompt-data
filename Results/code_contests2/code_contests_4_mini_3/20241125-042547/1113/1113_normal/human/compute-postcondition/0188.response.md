The code appends the character '1' to the variable `nRow`. The value of `nRow` is updated to include this new character, while the variable `res` is not directly modified in this code snippet. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `nRow` while keeping `res` and `i` unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include the next character of `row`, `nRow` is updated to include '1', `i` is the next character in `row`**
