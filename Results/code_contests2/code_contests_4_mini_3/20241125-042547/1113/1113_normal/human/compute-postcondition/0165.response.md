`nRow` is updated to include `i`, which is the next character in `row`. The previous value of `nRow` is updated with the value of `i`. The state of `row` remains unchanged as it is a non-empty string, and the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
