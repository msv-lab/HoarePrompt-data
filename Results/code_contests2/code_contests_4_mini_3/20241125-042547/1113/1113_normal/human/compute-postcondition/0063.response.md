The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since `nRow` is updated to append the character that follows '9' in `row`, the final state of `nRow` will depend on the particular value of `i`, but `nRow` itself will be updated. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is updated to include `i`.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated to include `i`**
