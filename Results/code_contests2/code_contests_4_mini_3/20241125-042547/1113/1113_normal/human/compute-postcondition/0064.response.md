Postcondition: ***`nRow` is updated based on the character `i`. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. For any other character `i`, that character is appended to `nRow`. In both cases, `row` has at least one character remaining, ensuring that the program correctly handles the scenario where `i` could be any character except for an empty one.***
