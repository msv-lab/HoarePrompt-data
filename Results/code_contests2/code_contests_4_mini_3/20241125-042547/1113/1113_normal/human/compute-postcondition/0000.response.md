The code `sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()` redirects the standard output to a bytes buffer instead of the default output stream. This means that any print statements or outputs that would normally go to the console will now be captured in this buffer.

No existing variables are modified by this line of code, and the integer `t` and the test case structure remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in where the output is directed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; the standard output is redirected to a bytes buffer**
