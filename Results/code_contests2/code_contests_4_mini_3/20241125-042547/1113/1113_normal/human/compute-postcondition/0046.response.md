Output State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the concatenation of elements from `row`, with each occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'. If `row` is an empty string or has no elements, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string. `res` retains its previous value throughout the execution. If `row` contains at least one element, the loop executes and processes each element of `row`.**
