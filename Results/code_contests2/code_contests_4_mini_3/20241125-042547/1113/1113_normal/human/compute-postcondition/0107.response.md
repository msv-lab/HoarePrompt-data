Postcondition: ***`nRow` is either '1' concatenated with `i` or the next character in `row` concatenated with `i`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to have '1' appended to it, resulting in '1' concatenated with `i` (thus forming '11' when `i` is '9'). If `i` is any character from '0' to '8', `nRow` is updated to have `i` appended to it, maintaining the original form of `nRow` with the new character.***
