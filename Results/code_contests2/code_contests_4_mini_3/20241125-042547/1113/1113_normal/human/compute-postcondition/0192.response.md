Output State: **`nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', while all other characters remain unchanged. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop executes for each character in `row`. If `row` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `nRow` remains an empty string. `res` is updated to include `nRow` at the end of the loop execution.**
