Postcondition: ***`nRow` is an empty string initially, `res` retains its previous value, `i` is either '9' or another character (not '9'). If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. If `i` is any other character (including '0' or any other digit), `nRow` is updated to that character. The empty string condition of `nRow` is replaced with either '1' or the value of `i`, while `res` remains unchanged.***
