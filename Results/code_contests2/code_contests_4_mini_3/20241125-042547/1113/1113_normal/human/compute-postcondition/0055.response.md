The variable `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string and `i` is 0, after the execution, `nRow` will be '0'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '0', `res` has been updated by appending the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is '0', `res` has been updated by appending the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
