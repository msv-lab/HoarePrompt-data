The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i` to it. The initial state indicates that `nRow` can either be '1' or the new character from `row`. After execution, if `nRow` was initially '1', it will become '1' concatenated with `i`, and if it was the new character from `row`, it will also concatenate `i` to that character. The variable `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions; `i` is the next character in `row`; `nRow` is the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions; `i` is the next character in `row`; `nRow` is the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with `i`**
