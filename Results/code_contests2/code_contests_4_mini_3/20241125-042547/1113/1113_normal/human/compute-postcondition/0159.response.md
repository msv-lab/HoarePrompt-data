The value of `nRow` is updated to include '1', which means the previous value of `nRow` (which is an empty string) will now be concatenated with '1'. After execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is a string equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is a string equal to '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1'**
