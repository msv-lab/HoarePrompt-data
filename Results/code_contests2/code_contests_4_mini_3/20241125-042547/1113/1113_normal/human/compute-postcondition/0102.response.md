The code `nRow += i` concatenates the value of `i` to the existing value of `nRow`. Given that `nRow` is either '1' or the value of the next character in `row`, and `i` is the next character in `row`, the resulting value of `nRow` will depend on its initial state.

If `nRow` is '1', after executing the line, `nRow` will be '1' concatenated with the value of `i`. If `nRow` is the value of the next character in `row`, it will concatenate that character with `i`.

Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is either '1' concatenated with `i` or the next character in `row` concatenated with `i`; `res` retains its previous value; `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '1' concatenated with `i` or the next character in `row` concatenated with `i`; `res` retains its previous value; `i` is the next character in `row**
