`nRow` is updated by concatenating the value of `i` to it. The value of `i` is 9, and since `nRow` is an empty string, the new value of `nRow` will be '9'. The values of `res`, `row`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '9'.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '9'**
