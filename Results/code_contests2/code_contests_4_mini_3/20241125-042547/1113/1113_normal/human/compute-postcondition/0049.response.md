The value of `row` is assigned to the variable after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of `nRow` and `res` are not affected by this line of code, but `row` will hold a new string value. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 8.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string that contains the concatenation of elements from `row`, with each occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'; `res` is updated by appending `nRow`; `i` is 8; `row` is an input string**
