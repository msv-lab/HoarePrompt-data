The value of `row` is assigned the value from `input().strip()`, which means `row` will now hold the string input provided by the user after removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The variable `i` is unchanged at 9, and `res` is updated to include `nRow`, which is not affected by this change. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is now the user input string, and `i` is still 9.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is now the user input string, `i` is 9**
