The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i`, which is the second character of `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, `i` holds a valid character (the second character of `row`). Therefore, after execution, `nRow` is updated to include this character. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is updated to include `i`**
