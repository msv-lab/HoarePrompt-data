The code snippet `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the current value of `nRow`. The value of `nRow` is updated based on the previous value of `nRow` and the new character '1'. The variable `res` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The variables `row` and `i` are also unaffected by this specific code execution. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow` while keeping the other variables' states unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated by appending '1', `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`**
