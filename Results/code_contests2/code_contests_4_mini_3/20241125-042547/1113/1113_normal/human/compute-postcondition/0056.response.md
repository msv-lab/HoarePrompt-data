Postcondition: ***`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is set to '1'. If `i` is any other value (including '0'), `nRow` is updated by appending `i` to its previous value. The variable `res` reflects the updated value of `nRow` after the operation, and `row` remains a non-empty string throughout.***
