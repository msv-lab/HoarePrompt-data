According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to 8 (a total of 9 iterations). At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 9. Since the loop's range is 9, this means that `i` must be equal to 9 for the loop to terminate, and there are no other states that need to be adjusted.

State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, which is constructed by replacing each occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', retaining all other characters unchanged, `i` is 9**
