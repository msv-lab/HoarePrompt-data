Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings, each derived from the corresponding input `row`, where every occurrence of '9' is replaced by '1'. If the input does not provide enough lines (less than 9), `res` will contain fewer than 9 elements, and if no input is provided, `res` remains an empty list. The loop always executes exactly 9 times based on the range, regardless of the content of the input rows. If `row` contains only '9's, `nRow` will be '1' for each occurrence of '9'. If `row` is empty, `nRow` will be an empty string, but still gets added to `res`. If the loop is interrupted before completing all iterations, `res` will only contain the successfully processed strings.**
