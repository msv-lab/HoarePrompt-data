The code assigns an empty string to `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` is a string that contains characters from `row` with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1', but now it is reset to an empty string. The values of `res` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the previous value, and `i` is 9.

Output State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the previous value, and `i` is 9**
