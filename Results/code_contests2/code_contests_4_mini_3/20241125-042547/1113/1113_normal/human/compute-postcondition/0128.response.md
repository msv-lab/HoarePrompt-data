According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over the characters in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` has been updated based on the last character `i` processed from `row`, and since `row` remains non-empty with at least one character left for processing, we need to ensure that `row` has at least one character remaining.

Since the loop processes each character in `row`, if `row` contains at least one more character after the current character `i`, the loop will execute again. Therefore, if `row` had a length of at least 2 before the last iteration, we can adjust it to indicate that `row` now has at least one less character.

To summarize:
- If `row` is non-empty, we need to ensure that it has at least one character remaining after the last processed character.
- If the last processed character `i` was the last character in `row`, we cannot have it execute again.

Thus, we need to update the state to reflect that `row` still has at least one character left to process.

State: **`nRow` is updated based on the next character from `row`, `row` contains at least one character left for processing**
