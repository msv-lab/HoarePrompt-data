According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over the elements in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` contains at least one element, and `i` represents the current element from `row`.

To execute the loop one more time, `row` must still contain at least one element after the last iteration, and `i` will take the next value from `row`. Given that `nRow` is a string that contains either '1' if `i` is '9', or the value of `i` if `i` is not '9', we need to ensure that `i` will be updated to the next element in `row`.

As `row` contains at least one element, the next state will depend on the remaining elements in `row`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is at least one more element in `row` after the current `i`.

State: **`nRow` is a string that contains either '1' if `i` is '9', or the value of `i` if `i` is not '9', `res` contains the previous value, `row` contains at least two elements**
