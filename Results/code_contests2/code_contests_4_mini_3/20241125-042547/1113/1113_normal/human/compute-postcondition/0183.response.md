According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row`. If `row` has more characters remaining after the current position of `i`, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string and `i` is the first character of `row`. 

If `i` is '9', then `nRow` has been updated to '1', indicating that the next character will be processed. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` reflects the current value of `i`, which is the first character of `row` that is not '9'.

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if there are more characters in `row` after the current character `i`. Since `i` is currently the first character of `row`, to execute again, `i` needs to be updated to the next character in the string.

So, we adjust the state to indicate that the next character in `row` is now `i`, and we also need to ensure that `row` has not been completely iterated through.

State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `row`**
