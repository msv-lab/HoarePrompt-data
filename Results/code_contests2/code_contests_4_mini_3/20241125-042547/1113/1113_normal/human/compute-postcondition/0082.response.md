The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`, which is the next character in `row`. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but it is updated based on the new value of `i`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated accordingly based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated accordingly based on the value of `i`**
