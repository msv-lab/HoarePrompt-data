The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`, which means it is now reset and contains no characters. The values of the other variables (`res`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `nRow` while indicating that the other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`nRow` is '', `res` is updated by appending the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 8, `row` is an input string**
