The variable `nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to its current value. The initial state indicates that `nRow` could contain '1' or the modified character from `row`. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will include '1' appended to its existing value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` includes the original value plus '1'**
