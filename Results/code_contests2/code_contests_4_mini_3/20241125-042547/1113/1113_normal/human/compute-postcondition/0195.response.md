Output State: **`res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions after replacing each '9' in the input strings with '1'. The loop executes exactly 9 times, as specified by the range, and will always append 9 modified strings to `res`. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string, but still gets added to `res`. If `row` contains only '9's, `nRow` will be '1' for each occurrence of '9'. If for some reason the input does not allow for 9 entries to be processed (e.g., the program is terminated early), the final length of `res` will be less than 9, and it will contain only the modified strings successfully processed.**
