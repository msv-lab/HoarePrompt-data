The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to the end of the string `nRow`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, the new value of `nRow` will be equal to `i`. The variable `res` remains unchanged, and the condition `i` is not equal to '9' does not affect the operation. The variable `row` also remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`nRow` is equal to `i`, `res` contains the previous value, `i` is not equal to '9', `row` contains at least 1 element**
