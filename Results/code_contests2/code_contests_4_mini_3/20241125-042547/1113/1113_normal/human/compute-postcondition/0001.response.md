The code registers a cleanup function to be called upon normal program termination. This function will write the contents of the standard output buffer to the actual standard output (file descriptor 1). The state of the variable `t` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and a cleanup function is registered to write the output buffer to standard output at program exit.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and a cleanup function is registered to write the output buffer to standard output at program exit.**
