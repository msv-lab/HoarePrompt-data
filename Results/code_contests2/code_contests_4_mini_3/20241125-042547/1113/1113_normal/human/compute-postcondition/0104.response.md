To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given state and the for loop.

1. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`, assigning each character to `i`.
2. After the last iteration, `i` has been updated to the next character in `row`.
3. The loop will continue as long as there are more characters in `row` to iterate over.

Given the conditions:
- If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '11' or the next character in `row` followed by '1'.
- If `i` is any character other than '9', then `nRow` is either '1' concatenated with `i` or the next character in `row` concatenated with `i`.
  
Since we need to ensure that the loop will execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is set to the next character in `row` and that there is indeed a next character to process.

Based on this understanding, if `i` is currently the last character in `row`, then there are no more characters left to iterate over, and thus the loop cannot execute again.

Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration:
- We need to ensure that `i` is set to a character that exists in `row` for the loop to continue. 
- If `i` is at the last character, we need to modify it to point to the next character.

Thus, the necessary adjustment will depend on the current state of `row` and `i`.

State: **`nRow` is either '1' concatenated with `i` or the next character in `row` concatenated with `i`, `i` is the next character in `row`.**
