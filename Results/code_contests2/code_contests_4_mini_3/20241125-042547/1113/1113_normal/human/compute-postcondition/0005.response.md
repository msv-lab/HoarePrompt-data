The line `res = []` initializes an empty list and assigns it to the variable `res`. The previous values of the affected variables (`t`, `input`, `write`, `maxint`) remain unchanged since this line only impacts the variable `res`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `res` while maintaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `input` is assigned to read a line from the input buffer; `write` is assigned sys.stdout.write; `maxint` is float('inf'); `res` is an empty list**
