The value of `nRow` is updated to include '1', and since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after executing `nRow += '1'`, `nRow` becomes '1'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`, `nRow` is '1', and the first character `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`, `nRow` is '1', and the first character `i` is equal to '9'**.
