According to the code, the loop iterates over the string `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` needs to be a non-empty string. The current state indicates that `row` is an input string, but we need to ensure it is not empty.

Since `i` starts at 0 but will be re-assigned during the loop, itâ€™s important to note that `i` will take on the values of each character in the string `row` during the iterations. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` will start at 0 but will be updated accordingly as the loop iterates over `row`. 

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is an empty string**
