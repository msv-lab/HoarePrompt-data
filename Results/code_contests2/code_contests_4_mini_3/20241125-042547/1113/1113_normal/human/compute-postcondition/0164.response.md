The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string `'1'` to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `res` is updated to include `nRow`, this operation will affect the value of `nRow` but not `row` or `i`. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it will now include the character `'1'` at the end.

Therefore, the output state indicates that `nRow` has been updated with the new character, while `row` remains a non-empty string and `i` is still the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, where `row` remains a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'**
