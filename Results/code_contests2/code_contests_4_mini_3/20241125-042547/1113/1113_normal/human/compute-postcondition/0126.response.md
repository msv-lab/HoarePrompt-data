The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating it with `i`, which represents the next character in the string `row`. The previous value of `nRow` is not explicitly stated, but since it is being updated based on the current character being processed, we can infer that `nRow` will now include the character `i`. The state of the other variables, `row` and `i`, is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is updated to include the next character `i`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated to include the next character `i`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
