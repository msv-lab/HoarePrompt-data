The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` to its previous value. Since `nRow` can either be '1' concatenated with `i` or the next character in `row` concatenated with `i`, the new value of `nRow` will depend on the previous value of `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is either '1' concatenated with `i` or the next character in `row` concatenated with `i`, and `nRow` is updated to its new value after concatenation with `i`.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '1' concatenated with `i` or the next character in `row` concatenated with `i`, and `nRow` is updated to its new value after concatenation with `i`**
