Postcondition: ***`res` is updated to include `nRow`, which is updated to include '1' if `i` is '9'. If `i` is any character other than '9', then `nRow` is updated to include `i`. In both cases, `row` remains a non-empty string with characters following '9', and `i` is the next character in `row`.***
