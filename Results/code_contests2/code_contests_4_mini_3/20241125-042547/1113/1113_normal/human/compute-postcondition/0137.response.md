According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one character. Since `nRow` is an empty string, it doesn't affect the loop's execution. The variable `i` is initialized to 0, but it will be re-assigned with each iteration.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `row` must be a non-empty string and `i` will take on each character in `row` during the iterations.

State: **`res` contains the original 9 strings and their modified versions, `i` will be each character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string**
