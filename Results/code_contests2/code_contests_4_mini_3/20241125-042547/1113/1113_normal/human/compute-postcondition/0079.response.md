Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `i` is a string representing a digit. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. If `i` is any other digit (from '0' to '8'), then `nRow` is updated to the string representation of `i`. The variable `row` remains a non-empty input string throughout the execution.***
