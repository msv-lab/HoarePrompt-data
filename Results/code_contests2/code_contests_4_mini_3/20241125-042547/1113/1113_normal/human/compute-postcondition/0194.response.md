According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i`, which iterates over a range of 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8 (the last value in the range since it is zero-indexed). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be 9, but the loop will not execute again because it only runs for values from 0 to 8. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 9 to indicate that the loop has completed its iterations. Since the loop is not designed to execute again, `nRow` and `res` do not need any adjustments.

State: **`nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'; `res` includes `nRow`; `i` is 9**
