According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will execute again if there are more characters in `row` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character in `row`, and since `row` is a non-empty string, we need to determine how many characters are left.

Given that the loop iterates over `row`, if `i` is the last character, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character to proceed. 

Since `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is set to '1'. If `i` is any other value, `nRow` is updated to that value of `i`. However, the key point here is that `row` must have more characters for the loop to continue, which means `row` needs to have at least one more character beyond the current `i`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is at least one more character in `row` and `i` should be updated to the next character in `row`.

State: **`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`**
