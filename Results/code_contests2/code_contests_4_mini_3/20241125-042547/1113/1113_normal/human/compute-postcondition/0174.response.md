In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over a range from 0 to 8 (inclusive), which means it will execute a total of 9 times. The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 8. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 9 since the loop condition is `for i in range(9)`. Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to 9, and since the loop does not utilize `nRow` or `row` in its control condition, no changes are necessary for those variables.

State: **`res` is updated to include `nRow`, `row` is unchanged, `i` is 9**
