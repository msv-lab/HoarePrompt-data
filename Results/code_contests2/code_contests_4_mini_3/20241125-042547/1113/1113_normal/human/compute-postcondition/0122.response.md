The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i` to it. The previous value of `nRow` is retained in `res`, while `row` remains unchanged, and `i` is the next character from `row`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow` along with the previous value of `res`. 

Output State: **`nRow` is updated by appending `i`, `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`**
