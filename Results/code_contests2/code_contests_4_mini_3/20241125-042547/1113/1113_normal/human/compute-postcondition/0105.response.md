The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` can either be '1' concatenated with `i` or the next character in `row` concatenated with `i`. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will be either '1' concatenated with `i` concatenated with '1' or the next character in `row` concatenated with `i` concatenated with '1'. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '1' concatenated with `i` concatenated with '1' or the next character in `row` concatenated with `i` concatenated with '1'; `i` is unchanged.**
