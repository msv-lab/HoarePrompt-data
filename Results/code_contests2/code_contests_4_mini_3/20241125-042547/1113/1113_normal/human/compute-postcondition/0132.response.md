Output State: **After the loop executes 9 times, `res` will contain the original 9 strings with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1', and `res` will have 18 elements (the original 9 plus the 9 modified strings). If the loop does not execute (if the initial state has fewer than 9 iterations, e.g., if the range is modified), `res` remains unchanged with only the original 9 strings.**
