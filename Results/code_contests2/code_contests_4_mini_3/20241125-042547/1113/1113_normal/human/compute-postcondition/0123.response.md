Postcondition: ***`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is any character other than '9', that character is appended to `nRow`. In both cases, `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character.***
