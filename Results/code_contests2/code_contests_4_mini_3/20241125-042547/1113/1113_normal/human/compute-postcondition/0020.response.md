Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next character in `row`, which is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `nRow` is equal to the length of `row`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` will attempt to add '1', resulting in a type mismatch error because `nRow` is an integer. If `i` is any other character, an error will occur due to the invalid operation of attempting to add a string to an integer.***
