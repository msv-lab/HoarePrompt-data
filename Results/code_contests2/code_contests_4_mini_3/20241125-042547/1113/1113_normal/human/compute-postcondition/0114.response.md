According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must be a non-empty string. The current states indicate that `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is set to 9, which may not be relevant since `i` will be reassigned to the first character of `row` during the loop execution. Therefore, the necessary adjustments are that `row` must be a non-empty string.

State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` is updated to append the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string**
