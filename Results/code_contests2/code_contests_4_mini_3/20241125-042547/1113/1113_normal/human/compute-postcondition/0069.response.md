Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, where each string is derived from the corresponding input `row` with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'. If there is no input provided for the loop (e.g., if it is interrupted or no input is given), then `res` remains empty. The loop will always execute exactly 9 times, as specified in the range, regardless of the content of the input rows. Therefore, `nRow` will be the processed string for each of the 9 iterations based on the corresponding input.**
