`nRow` is updated by appending the character `'1'` to its current value. The initial state indicates that `nRow` remains unchanged prior to this operation, so its previous value is not specified. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change to `nRow`.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated to include '1', `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` has one less character**
