According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`, which means that the loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in `row`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the current state indicates that `i` is a string representing a digit, and it can be any digit from '0' to '9'. The loop will execute for each character in `row`, and since `row` remains a non-empty string, it implies that there are still characters to iterate over.

If `i` is currently '9', then `nRow` would have been updated to '1'. If `i` is any other digit from '0' to '8', then `nRow` would be updated to that digit. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be updated to the next character in `row`. If there are still characters left in `row`, we need to adjust the state to reflect the next character:

- Since `row` is a non-empty input string, the next value of `i` will be the next character in `row`.
- The value of `T` and `res` do not need to be adjusted since they do not depend on `i`.

We need to ensure that `i` reflects the next character in `row`, and we need to maintain `nRow` based on the updated value of `i`. 

Hence, the next value of `i` must be the character following the current one in `row`.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is 10, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated accordingly based on the new value of `i`.**
