The value of `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The variables `res`, `i`, and `row` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is '1', `res` has the previous value of `nRow` appended to it, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` has the previous value of `nRow` appended to it, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string**
