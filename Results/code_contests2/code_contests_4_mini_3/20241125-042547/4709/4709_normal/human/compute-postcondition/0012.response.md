Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of length 3 containing lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing the string `a`, `A` is a string representing an integer value less than that of `B`, `B` is a string representing an integer value greater than that of `A`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if the first character of the string representation of `i` (which is equal to `int(A)`) is equal to the fifth character, and the second character is equal to the fourth character of that string representation. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.***
