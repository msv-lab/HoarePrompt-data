Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of length 3 containing lowercase English letters; `l` is a list containing the string `a`; `A` is the same as `a`; `B` is the same as `a`; if the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, then `ans` is set to 1. Since `A` and `B` are identical, `ans` will always be 1 after the execution of the program fragment.***
