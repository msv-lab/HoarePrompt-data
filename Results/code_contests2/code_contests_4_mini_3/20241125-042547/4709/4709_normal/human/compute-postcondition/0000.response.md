The variable `a` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts input from the user in the form of a string. Since the initial state specifies that the input consists of three strings, each of length 3, containing only lowercase English letters, `a` will be assigned one of those strings. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a string of length 3 containing lowercase English letters**
