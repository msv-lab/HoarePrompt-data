The variable `B` is assigned the value of `l[1]`, which refers to the second element of the list `l`. Since `l` contains the string `a` as its only element (assuming `l` is defined as `l = [a]`), `l[1]` does not exist. However, considering the context where `l` should contain more than one element, let's assume `l` has been defined as `l = [a, a, ...]` (with the second instance of `a` being the second element).

Therefore, `B` is assigned the value of the second element in the list `l`, which is `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is a string of length 3 containing lowercase English letters; `l` is a list containing the string `a`; `A` is the same as `a`; `B` is the same as `a`**
