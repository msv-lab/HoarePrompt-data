Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of length 3 containing lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing the string `a`, `A` is a string representing an integer value such that `int(A) + 2 < int(B)`, `B` is a string representing an integer value greater than that of `A`, `i` is equal to `int(A) + 2`, and `C` is a list of characters representing the string of `i`. If the first and fifth characters of `C` are equal and the second and fourth characters of `C` are equal, then `ans` is increased by 1. If the conditions for the characters are not met, `ans` remains unchanged.***
