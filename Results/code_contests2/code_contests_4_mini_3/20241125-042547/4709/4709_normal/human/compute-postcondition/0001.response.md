The variable `l` is assigned the value of `a.split()`, which splits the string `a` into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Since `a` is a string of length 3 containing lowercase English letters and does not contain any whitespace, the result of `a.split()` will be a list containing the original string `a` as its only element. The state of other variables is not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a string of length 3 containing lowercase English letters; `l` is a list containing the string `a`**
