The function reads a single line of input containing two space-separated integers, compares them, and initializes a counter `ans` to 1 if they are equal. It then attempts to iterate over the range from the first integer to the second integer, counting how many numbers in that range have the same first and last digits (and the same second and fourth digits). However, since the range is defined by the two integers and if they are equal, the loop does not execute, leaving `ans` as 1. Ultimately, it prints the value of `ans`, which will be 1 if the two numbers are equal or 0 if they are not. The function does not handle cases where the input is not formatted correctly or where the integers are not within the expected range.
