Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of length 3 representing one row of a 3x3 grid, `l` is a list of substrings derived from `a`, `ans` is increased by 1 if the first character of `C` is equal to the fifth character and the second character is equal to the fourth character; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The variable `i` is set to `int(A) + 1`, and `C` is a list of characters derived from the string representation of `int(A) + 1`.***
