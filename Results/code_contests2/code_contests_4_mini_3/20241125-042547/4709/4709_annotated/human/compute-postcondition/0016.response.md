Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of length 3 representing one row of a 3x3 grid, `l` is a list of substrings derived from `a`, `ans` is 3 if the first character of `C` equals the fifth character of `C` and the second character of `C` equals the fourth character of `C`, otherwise `ans` remains 2. `i` is `int(A) + 1`, and `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `int(A) + 1`.***
