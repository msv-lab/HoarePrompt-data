To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables involved:

1. **A** and **B**: The loop is set to iterate from `int(A)` to `int(B)`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(A)` must be less than `int(B)`. If `int(A)` is greater than or equal to `int(B)`, the loop will not execute.

2. **i**: The variable `i` will start at `int(A)` for the first iteration of the loop.

3. **ans**: The value of `ans` is related to the comparison of `A` and `B`. However, it does not directly affect the loop execution but indicates the relationship between the integer values of `A` and `B`. 

Based on this analysis, the conditions that need to be satisfied for the loop to execute are:
- `int(A) < int(B)` to ensure the loop runs.
- `i` should be initialized to `int(A)`.

Thus, the modified state must include these conditions:

State: **`a` is a string of length 3 representing one row of a 3x3 grid, `l` is a list of substrings derived from `a`, `ans` is 1 if the integer values of `A` and `B` are equal; otherwise, `ans` remains 0, `int(A)` is less than `int(B)`, `i` is `int(A)`**
