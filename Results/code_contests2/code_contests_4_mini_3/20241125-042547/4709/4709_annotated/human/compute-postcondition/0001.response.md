The variable `l` is assigned the value of `a.split()`, which splits the string `a` into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Since `a` is a string of length 3 representing one row of a 3x3 grid, `l` will contain the individual elements of that row as a list. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string of length 3 representing one row of a 3x3 grid; `l` is a list of substrings derived from `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a string of length 3 representing one row of a 3x3 grid; `l` is a list of substrings derived from `a`**
