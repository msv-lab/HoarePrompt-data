The function accepts user input as a string representing two integers (A and B). It checks if A is equal to B, setting a counter (ans) to 1 if they are equal. It then iterates through the range from A to B (exclusive), counting how many integers in that range have their first digit equal to the fifth digit and their second digit equal to the fourth digit (which only applies to integers with at least five digits). Finally, it prints the count. If A is greater than or equal to B, the loop does not execute, and the function will print either 0 or 1 based on the equality check. Additionally, if A or B are less than 10,000, the loop will not execute as there will be no valid five-digit integers to check.
