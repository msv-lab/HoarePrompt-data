The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the first character `i` of the input string is '1'. Since `pb` is initially 0, it will become 1 if `i` is '1' and will remain 0 if `i` is '0'. Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `i`. 

If `i` is '1', then `pb` becomes 1. If `i` is '0', `pb` remains 0. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pb` is either 0 or 1 depending on `i`, `i` is the first character of the input string (which is not empty)**
