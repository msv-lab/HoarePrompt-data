According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input string provided by `raw_input()`. The loop continues until all characters have been processed. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third character of the input string. For the loop to execute another time, the input string must have at least four characters, so that the next character can be processed. 

Given that `pa` can either be 2 or 3 if `i` is '1', or it remains either 0 or 1 if `i` is '0', we need to ensure that `i` represents the fourth character in the string for the next iteration.

Thus, we need to adjust the state such that:
- The input string must have at least 4 characters.
- `i` should be the fourth character of the input string.

State: **`a` is a 01-string with at least 4 characters, `b` is a 01-string, `pa` is either 2 or 3 (if `i` is '1') or remains either 0 or 1 (if `i` is '0'), `i` is the fourth character of the input string**
