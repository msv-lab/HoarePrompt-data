The value of `pb` is assigned to 0. This does not affect the other variables `pa`, `a`, or `b`, which retain their respective values. Therefore, the output state is: `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, and `pb` is set to 0.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, and `pb` is set to 0**
