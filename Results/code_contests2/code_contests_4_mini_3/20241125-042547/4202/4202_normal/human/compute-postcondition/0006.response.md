The expression `pa += i == '1'` increments `pa` by 1 if `i` is equal to '1', and adds 0 if `i` is '0'. The variable `pa` can be either 1 or 2 if `i` is '1', or it remains either 0 or 1 if `i` is '0'. Therefore, the possible states for `pa` after this operation are:

- If `i` is '1', `pa` will be incremented by 1, making it either 2 or 3 depending on its previous value.
- If `i` is '0', `pa` remains unchanged.

Thus, the output state will reflect the new possible values of `pa` depending on the value of `i`. 

Output State: **`a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pa` is either 2 or 3 (if `i` is '1') or remains either 0 or 1 (if `i` is '0'), `i` is the third character of the input string**
