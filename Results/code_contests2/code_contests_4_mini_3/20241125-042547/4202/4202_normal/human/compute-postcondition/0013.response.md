The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The value of `pb` can either be 0 or 1 depending on the second character of the input string, and `i` being the second character will determine if `pb` increases. Therefore, if `i` is '1', `pb` becomes 1 or 2; if `i` is '0', `pb` remains either 0 or 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string; `a` is a 01-string with at least 2 characters; `b` is a 01-string; `pb` is either 0 or 1 depending on the second character; `i` is the second character of the input string; `pb` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same**.
