To evaluate the provided snippet, we need to determine how the variable `pa` is affected by the condition `i == '1'`. 

1. The variable `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. 
2. The initial value of `pa` is 0. 
3. The value of `i` is given as the first character of a non-empty input string, which can either be '0' or '1'.

Therefore, if `i` is '1', `pa` will be incremented to 1. If `i` is '0', `pa` will remain 0.

The output state can be summarized as follows:

- If `i` is '1', then `pa` becomes 1.
- If `i` is '0', then `pa` remains 0.

Since we do not know the exact value of `i` (it depends on the input string), we can summarize the output state as:

Output State: **`a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pa` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first character of a non-empty input string**
