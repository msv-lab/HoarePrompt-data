The variable `pa` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of the variables `a` and `b` (which are 01-strings) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `pa` while indicating that `a` and `b` have not been modified.

Output State: **`a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pa` is 0**
