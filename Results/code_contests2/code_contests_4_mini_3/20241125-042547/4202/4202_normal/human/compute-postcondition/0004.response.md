The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. Since `i` is the second character of a non-empty input string, its value can either be '0' or '1'. 

- If `i` is '1', then `pa` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `pa` becomes `pa + 1`).
- If `i` is '0', then `pa` remains unchanged.

Since `pa` can either be 0 or 1, the possible outcomes for `pa` after the execution are:
- If `i` is '1', `pa` can be either 1 or 2 (if it started as 0 or 1, respectively).
- If `i` is '0', `pa` can remain 0 or 1.

Therefore, the output state reflects the possible outcomes for `pa` based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pa` is either 1 or 2 (if `i` is '1') or remains either 0 or 1 (if `i` is '0'), `i` is the second character of the non-empty input string**
