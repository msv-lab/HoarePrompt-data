To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the description carefully.

### Problem Description:
The task is to determine if it's possible to turn string `a` into string `b` using two operations:
1. Write the parity of `a` to the end of `a`.
2. Remove the first character of `a`.

The parity of a string is defined as 1 if there is an odd number of '1's in the string, and 0 otherwise.

### Code Analysis:
```python
pa = 0
for i in raw_input():
    pa += i == '1'
pb = 0
for i in raw_input():
    pb += i == '1'
print['NO', 'YES'][pa >= pb]
```
This code counts the number of '1's in the first string (assigned to `pa`) and the second string (assigned to `pb`). It then prints 'YES' if `pa` (the count of '1's in `a`) is greater than or equal to `pb` (the count of '1's in `b`), and 'NO' otherwise.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Strings:** The problem description indicates that the input strings will have lengths between 1 and 1000. However, if we consider if there were cases where strings could be empty, the program does not account for that. But as per the problem constraints, this case won't occur.
   
2. **Parities and Operations:** The operations described allow for the parity of `a` to change, which can add a '0' or '1' to the end of `a`. The code does not take into account whether it is possible to actually rearrange or modify `a` into `b` beyond just counting '1's. For example, if `a` has a significant number of '0's and fewer '1's compared to `b`, it may not be possible to convert `a` into `b`, even if the counts of '1's are adequate.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to the count in the second string, which is indeed what the code does. While this matches the code's behavior, it does not consider the actual ability to rearrange `a` to form `b`, which is crucial to the problem.

### Conclusion:
The code does not account for the necessary transformations that could be required to convert `a` to `b`, despite having a sufficient count of '1's. The hint acknowledges that the function only checks the counts of '1's, which could lead to incorrect conclusions, as the actual structure and order of characters in `a` compared to `b` matter significantly.

**Correctness: False**. 

The program fails to adequately solve the problem as described, especially in cases where the arrangement of characters in `a` and `b` is significant, despite potentially having enough '1's. For instance, `a = "0000"` and `b = "1111"` would return 'YES' from this code, which is incorrect.
