The function accepts two strings of '0's and '1's, counts the number of '1's in each string, and prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to the count in the second string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input strings may be empty, and it uses `raw_input()` for input, which may need to be adjusted for compatibility with Python 3.
