The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. Since `pb` can be either 2 (if `i` is '1') or 1 (if `i` is not '1'), the potential new values of `pb` will be either 3 (if `i` is '1') or 2 (if `i` is not '1'). The values of `pa`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `pa` is the count of '1's in the updated input string, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, and `pb` is either 3 (if `i` is '1') or 2 (if `i` is not '1').

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the updated input string, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, and `pb` is either 3 (if `i` is '1') or 2 (if `i` is not '1')**
