The code prints either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the comparison of `pa` and `pb`. Since `pb` remains 0 (as the input is empty), it is compared to `pa`. If `pa` is greater than or equal to `pb`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The states of `pa`, `pb`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged during this operation.

If `pa` is greater than or equal to `0`, the output will be 'YES'. If `pa` is negative (which is not possible in this context), the output would be 'NO'. 

Assuming `pa` is non-negative, the output state is: `pb` is 0, `pa` remains the count of '1's in the original input string, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, and it prints 'YES'.

Output State: **`pb` is 0, `pa` remains the count of '1's in the original input string, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, and it prints 'YES'**.
