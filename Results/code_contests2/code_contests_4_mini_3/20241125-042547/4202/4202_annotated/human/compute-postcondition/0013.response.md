The statement `pb += i == '1'` increments the value of `pb` by 1 if the variable `i` is equal to the string '1'. The initial state mentions that `pb` is 1 if the next character is '1', otherwise `pb` remains 0. 

- If `i` is '1', `pb` will increment from its initial value of 1 to 2.
- If `i` is not '1', `pb` will remain 0.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only conclude the possible outcomes based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `pb` is either 2 (if `i` is '1') or 1 (if `i` is not '1')**
