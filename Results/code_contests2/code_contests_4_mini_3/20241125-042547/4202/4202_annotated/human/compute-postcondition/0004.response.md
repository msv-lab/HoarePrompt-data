`pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. In the initial state, `i` is '1', so the condition `i == '1'` evaluates to True. Therefore, `pa` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is 2, `i` is '1'**
