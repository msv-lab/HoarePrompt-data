In the given code snippet, `pa` is updated based on the value of `i`. The expression `i == '1'` evaluates to `True` or `False`, which is equivalent to `1` or `0` when used in arithmetic operations. 

- If `i` is '1', `pa` will be incremented by 1.
- If `i` is '0', `pa` will remain unchanged.

Since `i` is the next character in the string `a`, we need to evaluate `i` to determine its value and how it affects `pa`.

The output state depends on the value of `i`, which can either be '0' or '1', affecting the value of `pa`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- If `i` is '1', then `pa` becomes `3`.
- If `i` is '0', then `pa` remains `2`.

Thus, the output state should reflect both possibilities:

Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is either 2 or 3, `i` is the next character in the string of '0's and '1's**.
