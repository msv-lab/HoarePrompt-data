The value of `i` is either '0' or '1'. The expression `i == '1'` evaluates to either `True` (1) or `False` (0). The value of `pa` is incremented based on this evaluation. Therefore, if `i` is '1', `pa` will be increased by 1; if `i` is '0', `pa` will remain the same. 

The output state is affected only by the change in `pa`, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the possible values of `pa` based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is either 0 or 1 (depending on the value of `i`), `i` is either '0' or '1'**
