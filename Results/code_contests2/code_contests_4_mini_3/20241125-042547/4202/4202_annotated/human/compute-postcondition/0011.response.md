The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is equal to '1'. Given that `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, this suggests that `pb` will increase by 1 for each '1' found. However, since the initial state does not provide the specific value of `i`, we cannot determine if `pb` will change. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `pb` is either unchanged or increased based on the evaluation of `i`.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `pb` is 0, and `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'**
