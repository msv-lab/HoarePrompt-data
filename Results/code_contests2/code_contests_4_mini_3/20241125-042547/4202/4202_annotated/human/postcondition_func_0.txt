The function accepts two strings of '0's and '1's from user input, counts the number of '1's in each string, and prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to the count in the second string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not take any parameters directly; instead, it relies on user input for its operation. Additionally, if either input is empty, the function will handle that by returning 'NO' since the count of '1's would be zero for the empty input.
