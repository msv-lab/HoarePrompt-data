To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the operations allowed (writing parity to the end of `a` and removing the first character of `a`) and how the program interprets these operations.

The provided program counts the number of '1's in both strings `a` and `b`:

```python
pa = 0
for i in raw_input():
    pa += i == '1'
pb = 0
for i in raw_input():
    pb += i == '1'
print['NO', 'YES'][pa >= pb]
```

### Analysis:

1. **Counting '1's:**
   - The program counts the number of '1's in both strings `a` (`pa`) and `b` (`pb`).
   - This is not sufficient to determine whether `a` can be transformed into `b` because the transformation process also depends on the parities of the strings, not just the counts of '1's.

2. **Logic of Transformation:**
   - The transformation from `a` to `b` can be affected by the parity of the string `a`. If `b` requires a certain parity (i.e., if the number of '1's in `b` is even or odd), the program does not check if `a` can reach that parity.
   - For example, if `a` has an even number of '1's and `b` has an odd number of '1's, it would be impossible to transform `a` to `b`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
a = "011"
b = "111"
```
- Here, `pa = 2` (even) and `pb = 3` (odd). 
- The output of the program would be "YES" because `2 >= 3` evaluates to `False`. However, it is impossible to transform `a` into `b` due to the parity mismatch.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the transformation logic described in the problem statement, as it only compares the counts of '1's without considering the parity of the strings. Thus, it can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
