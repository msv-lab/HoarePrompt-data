The value of `M` is assigned using the XOR operation with 3. The possible values of `M` are either 1 or 2. 

- If `M` is 1:
  - `1 XOR 3` results in `2`.
- If `M` is 2:
  - `2 XOR 3` results in `1`.

Therefore, after the execution, `M` will either be 2 or 1 depending on its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `M` is either 1 or 2; `N` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, remaining positive; `M` is either 1 or 2 after XOR operation.**
