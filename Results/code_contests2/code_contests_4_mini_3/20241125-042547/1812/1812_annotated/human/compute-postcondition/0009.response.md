Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `M` is either 1 or 2. If `M` is 1, then `N` is decreased by 1 and increased by 2, resulting in `N` being greater than or equal to `n + 1`. If `M` is 2, then `N` is decreased by 2 and increased by 1, resulting in `N` being greater than or equal to `n - 1`. In both cases, `N` remains a positive integer. The value of `M` is toggled to 2 or 1 respectively through the XOR operation with 3.***
