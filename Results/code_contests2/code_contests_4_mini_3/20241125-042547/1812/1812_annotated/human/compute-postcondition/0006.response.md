The value of `N` is decremented by `M`. Since `M` is either 1 or 2, `N` will either be reduced by 1 or 2. The exact new value of `N` depends on its initial value; however, since `N` is a positive integer, the new value remains positive. The other variable `M` is unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, and `M` is either 1 or 2; `N` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, remaining positive.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `M` is either 1 or 2; `N` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, remaining positive.**
