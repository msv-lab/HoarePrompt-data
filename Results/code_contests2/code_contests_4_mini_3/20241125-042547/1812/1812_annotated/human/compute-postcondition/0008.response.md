The value of `N` is incremented by `M`. Since `M` can be either 1 or 2, the new value of `N` will either be `N + 1` or `N + 2`. The initial state indicates that `N` can be either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and since `n` is a positive integer, both values for `N` are still positive. Therefore, the output state reflects the possible new values for `N` based on the two potential values of `M`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `M` is either 1 or 2; `N` is either `n` or `n + 1` or `n + 2`, remaining positive.**
