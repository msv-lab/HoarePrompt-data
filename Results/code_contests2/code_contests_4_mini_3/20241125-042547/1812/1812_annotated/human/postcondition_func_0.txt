The function accepts input consisting of a positive integer `N` (representing the row number, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18) followed by a character `C` (representing the seat in that row, which can be any letter from 'a' to 'f'). The function processes this input to compute a specific value based on the modified row number and seat character. It modifies `N` based on certain conditions involving `M`, where `M` is derived from the last character of the input. Finally, it prints a calculated result that incorporates the modified row number and the seat character. The function does not handle cases where the input does not conform to the expected format or ranges, which could lead to errors.
