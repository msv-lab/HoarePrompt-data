The function accepts a string input which consists of a positive integer followed by a single character ('a' to 'f'). It calculates and prints a value based on the integer and character, where the integer is used in calculations involving bitwise operations and specific arithmetic formulas. The output is affected by the last character of the input string, which determines part of the final calculation, but the function does not handle invalid input cases, such as if the string does not conform to the expected format or contains an inappropriate character.
