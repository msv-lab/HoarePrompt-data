Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18); `s` is a character ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'); `C` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 based on the last character of `s`; if `M` (calculated as (N - 1) & 3) is 1 or 2, then `N` is decreased by `M`, `M` is toggled using XOR with 3, and `N` is increased by the new value of `M`. If `M` is neither 1 nor 2, then `N` remains unchanged.***
