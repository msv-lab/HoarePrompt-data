The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that represents the row index and must satisfy the constraint (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18). The parameter `s` is a character that represents the seat in that row and can be one of the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'. After executing the function body, it returns a specific result based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a character `s`, where `n` represents the row index and `s` represents the seat in that row.**
