The function reads two integers `n` and `t` and a list of `n` integers from user input. It decrements `t` by the difference between 86400 and each value in the list until either `t` is less than or equal to 0 or all elements have been processed. It prints the number of iterations executed, which reflects how many elements were processed from the list. If `t` is initially less than or equal to 0, it prints `0`.
