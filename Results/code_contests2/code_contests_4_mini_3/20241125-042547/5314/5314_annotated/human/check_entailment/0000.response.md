To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it accurately implements the required logic.

### Code Analysis

The provided program is structured as follows:

1. It reads two integers `n` (number of days) and `t` (time required to read the book) from the input.
2. It reads a list `a` which contains the time Luba has to spend working during each day.
3. It initializes an index `i` to zero and enters a while loop that continues until `t` is greater than zero.
4. Inside the loop:
   - It calculates the free time for the day as `86400 - int(a[i])` and subtracts this from `t`.
   - It increments `i` to move to the next day.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `i`, which represents the day on which Luba finishes reading the book.

### Correctness Check

Let's consider the edge cases and the logic flow:

1. **Loop termination**: The loop continues until `t` is less than or equal to zero. If `t` is initially zero or negative, the loop does not execute, and `i` will be printed as zero. This is incorrect since Luba finishes reading on day 1 in this case.
   
2. **Index out of bounds**: If `i` reaches `n` (the number of days), the loop will attempt to access `a[i]`, which will result in an IndexError because there are no more days to process. This could happen if the total time required to read the book exceeds the total free time available over `n` days.

3. **Handling of the free time**: The program correctly calculates the free time available each day but does not handle the case when `t` is not fully decremented to zero before running out of days.

From the above analysis, we can identify a case where the program does not work correctly:

- **Case**: If Luba needs more time than what can be provided by the available work hours over all days. For instance, if `n = 3`, `t = 300000`, and `a = [86400, 86400, 86400]`, the program will run out of days without finishing reading the book, leading to an IndexError.

### Conclusion

Given the identified issues with the program, it does not cover all potential edge cases, particularly the handling of when `t` is still greater than zero and running out of days or when `t` is initially zero and the program fails to account for that correctly.

Thus, the program has flaws that make it incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
