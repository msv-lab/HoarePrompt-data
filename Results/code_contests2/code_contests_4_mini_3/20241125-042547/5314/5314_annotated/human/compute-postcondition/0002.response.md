The variable `i` is initialized to `0`. The values of `n`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the newly assigned value for `i` while holding the other variables constant.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000 inclusive, `a` is a list of strings from the input, and `i` is 0**
