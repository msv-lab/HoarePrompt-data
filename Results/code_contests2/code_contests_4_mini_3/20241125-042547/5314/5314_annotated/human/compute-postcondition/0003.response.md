The code decrements `t` by the value of `86400` minus the integer value of `a[i]`. The specific value of `a[i]` can be determined based on the provided list of strings. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000, inclusive, and `i` is 0, we need to consider the previous values of `t` and `a[i]` to compute the new value of `t`.

Let's assume `a[i]` is parsed to an integer. 

The calculation would be:
- New `t` = Old `t` - (86400 - int(a[i]))

Since we do not have the specific values of `t` and `a[i]`, we cannot calculate the exact new value of `t`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the changes without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is decremented by (86400 - int(a[i])), `a` is a list of strings from the input, `i` is 0**
