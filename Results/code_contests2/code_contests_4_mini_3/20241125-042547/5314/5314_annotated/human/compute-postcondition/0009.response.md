The statement `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])` modifies the value of `t`. Here, `t` is decremented by the result of the expression `86400 - int(a[i])`. Since `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented, its exact value is not specified, but it remains positive. The value of `a[i]` is accessed, but without prior information, we cannot determine its specific integer value. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `t` has been updated based on the expression while acknowledging the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` has been decremented and remains greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1, and `t` is updated based on `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])`.**
