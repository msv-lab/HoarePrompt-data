According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has been decremented but is still greater than 0. Therefore, there is no need to adjust `t` since it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute one more time. The variable `i` has been increased by 1, but this does not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` has been decremented but is still greater than 0, and `i` is increased by 1**
