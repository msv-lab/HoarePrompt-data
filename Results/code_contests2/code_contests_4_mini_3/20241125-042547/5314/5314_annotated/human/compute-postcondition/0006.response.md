The value of `t` is decremented by the expression `86400 - int(a[i])`. Since `t` is currently greater than 0 and `a[i]` is an element from the list `a`, `int(a[i])` will convert the value of `a[i]` to an integer. This operation affects only `t`, and the new value of `t` will be `t - (86400 - int(a[i]))`. The specific value of `t` after this operation will depend on the current value of `t` and the value of `a[i]`, but we know `t` remains greater than 0 post-operation.

Therefore, the output state remains:
`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive; `t` has been decremented but is still greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive; `t` has been decremented but is still greater than 0**
