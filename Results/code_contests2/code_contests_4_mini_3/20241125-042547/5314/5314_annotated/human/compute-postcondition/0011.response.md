According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has been decremented and remains greater than 0, meaning it is still possible for the loop to execute one more time without any adjustments. 

No other states need to be adjusted, as `n` and `i` do not influence the condition for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` has been decremented and remains greater than 0, and `i` is increased by 1**
