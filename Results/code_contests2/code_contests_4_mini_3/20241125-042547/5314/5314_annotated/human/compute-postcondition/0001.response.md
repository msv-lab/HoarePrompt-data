The variable `a` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which means it will store a list of strings split from the input received. The input can be any string, so the specific contents of `a` depend on the user input. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state indicates that `a` is now a list of strings based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000 inclusive, and `a` is a list of strings from the input**.
