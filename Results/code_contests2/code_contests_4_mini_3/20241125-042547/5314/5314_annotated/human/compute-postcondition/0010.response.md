The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variables `n` and `t` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state indicates that `i` has been increased by 1. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` has been decremented and remains greater than 0, and `i` is increased by 1**
