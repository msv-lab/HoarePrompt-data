The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and since `i` was initially 0, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is decremented by (86400 - int(a[0])), `a` is a list of strings from the input, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is decremented by (86400 - int(a[0])), `a` is a list of strings from the input, `i` is 1**
