The code assigns values to `n` and `t` by reading a line of input, splitting it into two parts, and converting those parts into integers. The specific values for `n` and `t` are not provided, but they will be integers within their respective ranges. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000 inclusive**
