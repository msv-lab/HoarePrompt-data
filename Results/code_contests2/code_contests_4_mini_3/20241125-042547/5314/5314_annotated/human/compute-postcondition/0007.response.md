The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` has been decremented but is still greater than 0, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` has been decremented but is still greater than 0, and `i` is increased by 1**
