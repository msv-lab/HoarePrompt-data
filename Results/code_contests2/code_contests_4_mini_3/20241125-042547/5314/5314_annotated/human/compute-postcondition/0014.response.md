The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `a`. 

- `n` is an integer that must be between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `t` is an integer that must be between 1 and 1,000,000 inclusive.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `ai` is between 0 and 86,400 inclusive.

Based on the provided information, the function processes these parameters and produces an output. However, the specific output or logic of the function is not detailed in the prompt.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 to 100), an integer t (1 to 1,000,000), and a list a of n integers (each between 0 and 86,400).**
