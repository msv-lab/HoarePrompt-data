The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but reads input from the user. It expects to read two integers `n` and `t`, where `n` is the count of subsequent integers, and `t` is an integer value that will be decremented. It also expects a list of `n` integers, which represent time values.

The function processes the input values by subtracting from `t` the difference between 86400 and each element in the list `a` for as many times as possible. The loop continues until either `t` becomes less than or equal to 0, or all elements of the list have been processed. The function then prints the number of iterations performed, which corresponds to how many elements were processed from the list `a`.

Key edge cases include:
- If `t` is initially less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and the function will print `0`.
- If the list `a` is shorter than `n`, it will stop processing when it runs out of elements in `a`, which may result in the function printing a value less than `n`.

Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `t` and a list of `n` integers from user input. It decrements `t` by the difference between 86400 and each value in the list until either `t` is less than or equal to 0 or all elements have been processed. It prints the number of iterations executed, which reflects how many elements were processed from the list. If `t` is initially less than or equal to 0, it prints `0`. **
