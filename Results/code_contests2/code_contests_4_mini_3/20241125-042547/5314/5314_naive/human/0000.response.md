To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code against the given problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
- Luba has `n` days and needs `t` seconds to finish reading a book.
- Each day, she has `a[i]` seconds of work, so the free time she has for reading each day is `86400 - a[i]` seconds.
- We need to find out the minimum day when she can finish reading the book.

### Code Analysis:
The program reads the input values for `n` and `t`, and then it reads the array `a` which contains the work seconds for each day. The while loop continues until `t` becomes less than or equal to zero, decrementing `t` by the number of seconds available for reading each day until Luba has finished reading the book. The variable `i` is used to count the number of days.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Index Out of Bounds**: The code does not check if `i` exceeds `n-1`. If `t` is large and `i` reaches `n` while `t` is still greater than zero, it will cause an IndexError when it tries to access `a[i]`.

2. **Infinite Loop**: If `t` is not reduced to zero or below by the time `i` reaches `n`, the loop will continue indefinitely as there are no checks to handle the case where all days are exhausted.

3. **Correctness of Final Output**: The code prints `i`, which represents the number of days taken, but if the loop exits due to `t` being exhausted after the last day, `i` will incorrectly represent the number of days since it is incremented after checking `t`.

### Example Case That Fails:
Consider the case:
```
Input
3 1000000
30000 30000 30000
```
- The first day allows for `86400 - 30000 = 56400` seconds.
- The second day allows for another `56400` seconds.
- The third day allows for another `56400` seconds.

After three days, Luba will have read `56400 * 3 = 169200` seconds, and `t = 1000000` - `169200` = `830800` seconds still remain. The program would attempt to access `a[3]` which does not exist, leading to an IndexError.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the potential case of running out of days before finishing the book and can lead to an IndexError. Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**.
