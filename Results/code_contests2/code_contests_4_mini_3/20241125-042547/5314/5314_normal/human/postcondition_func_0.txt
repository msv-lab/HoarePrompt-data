The function reads two integers `n` and `t`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing time intervals. It calculates how many intervals can be processed within the time `t` by subtracting the time taken for each interval from `t` until `t` is no longer positive or all intervals are processed, then prints the number of intervals processed. It does not handle cases where `t` remains positive after processing all intervals, potentially leading to an index out of range error.
