The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 1, so after execution, `i` is now 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `t` updated based on user input; `a` is a list of substrings from the input; `i` is 2; `t` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` and `t` updated based on user input; `a` is a list of substrings from the input; `i` is 2; `t` is greater than 0**
