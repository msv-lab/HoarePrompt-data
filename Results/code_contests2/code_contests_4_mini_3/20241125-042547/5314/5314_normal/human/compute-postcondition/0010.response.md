The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 2. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `a`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` and `t` updated based on user input; `a` is a list of substrings from the input; `i` is 3; `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[2]))**
