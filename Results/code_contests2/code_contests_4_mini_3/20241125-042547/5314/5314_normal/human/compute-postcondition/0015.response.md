The function `func` accepts no parameters explicitly but reads input from the user. It expects the first line of input to contain two integers, `n` (the number of time intervals) and `t` (total time in seconds), followed by a second line with `n` integers representing the time taken for each interval. The function computes how many intervals can be processed within the given time `t` by reducing `t` by the difference between 86400 seconds (the total seconds in a day) and the value of each interval until `t` becomes less than or equal to 0 or until all intervals have been processed. The function prints the number of intervals processed before `t` runs out. 

However, the code does not handle the case where `t` could become negative or where there could be an index out of range error if the number of intervals is less than `n` and `t` remains positive after exhausting all intervals. 

Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `t`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing time intervals. It calculates how many intervals can be processed within the time `t` by subtracting the time taken for each interval from `t` until `t` is no longer positive or all intervals are processed, then prints the number of intervals processed. It does not handle cases where `t` remains positive after processing all intervals, potentially leading to an index out of range error. **
