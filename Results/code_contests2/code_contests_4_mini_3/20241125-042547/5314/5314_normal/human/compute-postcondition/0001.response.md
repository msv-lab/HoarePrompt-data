The variable `a` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes user input as a string, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns that list to `a`. The values of `n` and `t` are not directly affected by this operation, but they may influence the user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is now a list containing the split input values.

Output State: **`n` and `t` updated based on user input; `a` is a list of substrings from the input**
