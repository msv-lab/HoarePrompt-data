According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `t` updated based on user input; `a` is a list of substrings from the input; `i` is 2; `t` is greater than 0**
