In the given code snippet, the variables `n` and `t` are assigned values from the input, which is expected to be a space-separated string of two integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is already an integer between 1 and 100, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000. 

The impact of the code is that `n` and `t` will now be reassigned based on the input received. The previous values of `n` and `t` will be replaced by whatever integers are inputted. Since the values for `n` and `t` are not explicitly given in the initial state and are subject to change through user input, we cannot specify their exact new values.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` and `t` have been updated based on user input, while the previous values are no longer relevant. 

Output State: **`n` and `t` updated based on user input**
