The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer that must be between 1 and 1,000,000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` must be between 0 and 86,400. The function's output is not detailed in the provided information, so we cannot specify the return values based on conditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n`, an integer `t`, and a list `a` of `n` integers, while ensuring all parameters meet their specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 100), t (an integer between 1 and 1,000,000), and a (a list of n integers where each integer ai is between 0 and 86,400).**
