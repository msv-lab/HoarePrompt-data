Output State: **`if t is greater than 0 then t` is reduced by the sum of (86400 - int(a[j])) for j from 0 to i-1, `i` is equal to the number of iterations (which will be less than or equal to the length of `a`). If t is less than or equal to 0 initially, the loop does not execute and `t` remains unchanged, `i` remains 0, and `a` is unchanged. If the loop executes until the end of `a` and `t` still remains positive, it will lead to an index out of range error when trying to access `a[i]` beyond its length.**
