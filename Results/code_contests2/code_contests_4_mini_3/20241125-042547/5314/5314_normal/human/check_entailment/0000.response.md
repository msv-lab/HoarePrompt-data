Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description:
The task is to help Luba determine the minimum number of days it will take her to finish reading a book given the time required to read the book (`t` seconds) and the amount of time she spends working each day (`a[i]` seconds). There are 86400 seconds in a day, so the free time she has for reading each day is `86400 - a[i]`.

### Program:
```python
(n, t) = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
a = raw_input().split()
i = 0
while t > 0:
    t -= 86400 - int(a[i])
    i += 1
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Logic of the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of days `n` and the total reading time `t`.
   - It reads the list `a`, which contains the working time for each day.
   - It then enters a loop where it calculates the free time for reading each day and subtracts it from `t` until `t` is no longer positive.
   - It increments the counter `i` to keep track of how many days have been used.
   - Finally, it prints the number of days `i`.

2. **Potential Issues**:
   - The loop does not check whether `i` exceeds the length of the list `a` (which is `n`). If `t` does not reach zero before all days are used, `i` could go beyond the bounds of the list, leading to an `IndexError`.
   - The program does not handle the case where `t` may still be positive after processing all available days. In such cases, the program would incorrectly print the number of days processed without confirming if the reading was completed.

3. **Output Hints**:
   - The output hints state that the function reads two integers `n` and `t`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing time intervals. It suggests that the program calculates the intervals processed within time `t`, noting that it does not handle cases when `t` remains positive after processing all intervals.
   - This aligns with the issues identified above.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle cases where Luba may still have time left to read after all days have been processed, and it risks an `IndexError` if `t` does not reach zero. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
