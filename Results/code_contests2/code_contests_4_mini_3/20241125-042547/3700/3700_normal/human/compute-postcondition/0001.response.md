The variable `s` is assigned the value of the sum of integers from the input. The input is read as a string from `raw_input()`, split into individual components, converted to integers, and then summed. The initial state indicates that `H` is a list of integers from input, meaning the input will affect `s`, but `N`, `K`, and `H_i` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `s`.

Output State: **`H` is a list of integers from input; `N` is the first integer from input; `K` is a non-negative integer; `s` is the sum of the integers from the input**
