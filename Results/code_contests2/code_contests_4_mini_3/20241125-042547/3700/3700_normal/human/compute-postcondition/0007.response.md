The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: `N`, `K`, and a list of integers `H` representing the health of each monster. `N` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 200,000, `K` is a non-negative integer constrained between 0 and 200,000, and each element of the list `H` (denoted as `H_i`) is an integer representing the health of a monster, with each `H_i` constrained between 1 and 10^9.

The output of the function is determined by the values of `N`, `K`, and the health values in the list `H`, but specific return values or cases are not provided in the output details. Therefore, we can summarize the functionality based on the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N, a non-negative integer K, and a list of integers H representing the health of N monsters. The output will depend on the values of N, K, and the health values in H.**
