Postcondition: ***`H` is a list of integers, `N` is the first integer from the input, `K` is a non-negative integer, and `s` is the sum of the integers from the input. If the sum `s` is greater than or equal to the first element of the list `H`, the output is 'Yes'. Otherwise, if `s` is less than the first element of `H`, the output is 'No'.***
