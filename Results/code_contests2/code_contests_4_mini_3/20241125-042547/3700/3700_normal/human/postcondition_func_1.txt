The function accepts two lines of input where the first line contains two integers (H and N) and the second line contains N integers. It calculates the sum of the N integers and compares it to H. If the sum is greater than or equal to H, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. Note that the function does not handle any input validation or exceptions, so it assumes the input is always correctly formatted.
