Precondition: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 200,000, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 200,000, and H_i are integers representing the health of each monster, where 1 <= H_i <= 1,000,000,000. The input consists of two lines where the first line contains N and K, and the second line contains the health values H_1, H_2, ..., H_N.**
