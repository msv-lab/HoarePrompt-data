The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calculates their sum `c`, and returns `c` after subtracting a constant value `mod` if `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`. It does not handle the case where `mod` is not defined, which could lead to an error if `mod` is not available in the scope of the function.
