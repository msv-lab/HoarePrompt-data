The function `func_2` does not explicitly take any parameters as input. Instead, it reads from standard input, where the first line contains two integers, `N` (a positive integer) and `K` (a non-negative integer). The second line contains `N` integers representing the health values of each monster, denoted as `H_1, H_2, ..., H_N`.

After processing the input, the function will return a value based on the conditions derived from the parameters. The specific output is not detailed, but it is implied that the function will produce a result based on the health values and the parameters N and K.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to read input values for N, K, and the health of monsters from standard input, and return a specific result based on these values.

Functionality: **The function reads two integers N and K, followed by N integers representing the health of monsters, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
