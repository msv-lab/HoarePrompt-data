Postcondition: ***`H` is a list of integers representing the health values of the monsters, `N` is a positive integer representing the number of monsters, `K` is a non-negative integer, and `s` is the sum of the input integers. If `s` is greater than or equal to the maximum health value in `H`, the output is 'Yes'. Otherwise, if `s` is less than the maximum health value in `H`, the output is 'No'.***
