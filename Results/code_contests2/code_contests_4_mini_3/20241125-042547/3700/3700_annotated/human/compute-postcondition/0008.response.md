The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers from input: the first integer is `H`, which represents the health threshold, and the second integer is `N`, which represents the number of monsters. The function then reads `N` integers from input that represent the health values of the monsters. It calculates the sum of these integers, denoted as `s`. Finally, it checks if `s` is greater than or equal to `H`. If it is, the function prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, the annotations imply that `H` is a list of integers, which is incorrect as `H` is a single integer representing a health threshold. Additionally, the variable `K` mentioned in the comments is never defined or used in the function. 

Thus, the functionality of the function should accurately reflect these points, focusing on the actual behavior of the code.

Functionality: ** The function reads a health threshold `H` and the number of monsters `N`, then calculates the sum of the health values of `N` monsters. It prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to `H`, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters and does not utilize a variable `K`. **
