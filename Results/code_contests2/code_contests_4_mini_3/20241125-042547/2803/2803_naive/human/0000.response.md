To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements step by step.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
1. **Input**: Two integers, `n` (number of candies) and `k` (maximum candies Grisha can take).
2. **Output**: The largest possible xor-sum of the tastiness of the candies Grisha can take.
3. **Constraints**: `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18`.
4. **XOR-Sum Calculation**: The xor-sum of selected candies should be maximized.

### Provided Program:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1 if k - 1 else n)
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Understanding the Logic**:
   - The program calculates the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` using `len(bin(n)[2:])`.
   - It computes `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`, which gives the maximum value that can be obtained by XORing all numbers from `1` to `2^m - 1`, where `m` is the number of bits in `n`.
   - The conditional checks if `k-1` is non-zero, implying `k > 1`, in which case it returns the maximum possible XOR sum. If `k == 1`, it simply returns `n`, which means if Grisha can only take one candy, he will take the candy with tastiness `n`.

2. **Evaluating Edge Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: When `n = 1` and `k = 1`.
     - Expected output: `1` (Grisha can only take the only candy available).
     - Program output: `1` (correct).
   - **Case 2**: When `n = 2` and `k = 1`.
     - Expected output: `2` (Grisha can only take the candy with tastiness `2`).
     - Program output: `2` (correct).
   - **Case 3**: When `n = 4` and `k = 3`.
     - Expected output: `7` (Grisha can take candies `1, 2, 4`, resulting in an XOR of `7`).
     - Program output: `7` (correct).
   - **Case 4**: When `n = 6` and `k = 6`.
     - Expected output: `7` (Grisha can take all candies).
     - Program output: `7` (correct).
   - **Case 5**: When `n = 3` and `k = 2`.
     - Expected output: `3` (Grisha can take candies `2` and `3`, resulting in an XOR of `1` but also `3`).
     - Program output: `3` (correct).

### Summary of Findings:
- The provided program correctly handles the required output for a variety of test cases, including edge cases and typical cases.
- The logic used in the program accurately reflects the requirements of maximizing the xor-sum based on the constraints given.

### Conclusion:
Since I could not find any case where the program does not work as specified in the problem description and all tested cases yield the correct output, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
