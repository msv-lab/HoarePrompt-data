The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It computes and prints `2` raised to the power of the number of bits required to represent `n` minus one, unless `k` is equal to `1`, in which case it simply prints `n`. This means that if `k` is `1`, the output is `n`, and if `k` is greater than `1`, the output is based on the binary representation of `n`. The function does not handle any input validation or error cases.
