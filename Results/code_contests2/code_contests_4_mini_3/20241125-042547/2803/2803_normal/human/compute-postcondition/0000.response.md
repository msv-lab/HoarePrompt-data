The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input, where the input is expected to be two positive integers separated by a space. The constraints indicate that `k` is always less than or equal to `n`, and both are within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\). Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `n` and `k` as positive integers provided by the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
