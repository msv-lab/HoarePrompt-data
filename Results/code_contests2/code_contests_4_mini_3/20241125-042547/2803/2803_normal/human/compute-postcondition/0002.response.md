The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, constrained such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). Since the output specifics are not given, we cannot detail the return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k` that meet the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, which are positive integers with constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.**
