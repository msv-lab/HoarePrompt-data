To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to find the largest possible xor-sum of a selection of candies labeled from 1 to n, with the constraint that we can only select up to k candies.
- The xor-sum is defined as the bitwise XOR of the selected integers.

### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print(2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1 if k - 1 else n)
```

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, which define the range of candies and the maximum number of candies that can be selected, respectively.
2. **XOR Calculation**: 
   - The expression `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1` computes the largest possible XOR-sum for the candies from 1 to n.
   - `len(bin(n)[2:])` calculates the number of bits needed to represent `n` in binary. The largest value that can be represented with that number of bits is `2**(number of bits) - 1`, which is the maximum XOR-sum achievable by selecting all bits set (i.e., all numbers up to that range).
3. **Conditional Logic**: 
   - The code checks if `k - 1` (i.e., if `k` is greater than 1). If true, it calculates the maximum XOR-sum as described above. If `k` is equal to 1, it simply returns `n`, which corresponds to selecting only one candy.

### Checking Against the Problem Description:
- For `k = 1`, the code correctly returns `n`, as we can only take one candy, which would have the maximum tastiness value of `n`.
- For `k > 1`, the calculation of `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1` should yield the maximum XOR-sum from the range. This works because it accounts for the maximum number of bits available in the representation of `n`.

### Potential Issues:
- Let's consider edge cases:
  - If `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the output should be `1`, since Grisha can only select the single candy available.
  - If `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the output should be `2` (selecting the candy with tastiness 2).
  - If `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output should be `3` (selecting both candies 1 and 2, yielding XOR-sum of 3).

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic for both cases (`k = 1` and `k > 1`), and it handles the maximum possible values for `n` and `k` appropriately.

Since I cannot find any input case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
