The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). The function does not specify a return value in the provided output, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k` within the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and k, both are positive integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The return value is not specified.**
