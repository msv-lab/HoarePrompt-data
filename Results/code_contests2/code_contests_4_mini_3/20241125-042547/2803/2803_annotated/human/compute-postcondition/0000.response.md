The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input provided, which consists of two positive integers. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers with the condition that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18, their exact values will be determined by the user input. The execution does not affect other variables, so the output state reflects the assignment.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers assigned from user input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
