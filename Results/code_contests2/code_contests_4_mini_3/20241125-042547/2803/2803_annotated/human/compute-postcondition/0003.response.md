Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` from user input. It returns `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1` if `k` is greater than 1, which calculates the number of non-negative integers that can be represented with the same number of bits as `n` minus 1. If `k` equals 1, it returns `n` directly. The function does not handle invalid input cases, such as when `k` is less than 1 or greater than `n`. **
