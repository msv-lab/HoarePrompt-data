The function accepts no parameters and reads two integers `n` and `m` from user input. It generates a string that consists of '10' repeated `n // 2` times, and appends '1' if `n` is odd. The function does not return any value, and it mainly produces output based on the value of `n`, ignoring `m` entirely, which may lead to confusion regarding its relevance.
