The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. It performs operations based on the defined constraints and relationships for integers `n` and `m`, along with the ranges defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. However, since the function does not take input parameters directly, it likely operates on predefined or global values. The output is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, without specific output details, we can only state that the function operates within the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and operates under the constraints that n and m are integers between 1 and 1000, with specific ranges for visitors defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i. The exact return value is not specified.**
