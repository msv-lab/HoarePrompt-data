The line of code assigns values to `n` and `m` based on user input. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not known since they are being defined by the input. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state will indicate that `n` and `m` are now assigned values from user input, but we do not know their specific values.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from user input**
