The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `m` from input. It constructs and prints a string consisting of '10' repeated `n // 2` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd. The variable `m` is captured from the input but not utilized within the function, indicating that it does not influence the output or functionality. The function does not handle any edge cases related to the values of `n` and `m` because it does not validate or check their ranges. 

Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from input, and prints a sequence of '10' repeated n//2 times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd; the integer `m` is ignored in the process. **
