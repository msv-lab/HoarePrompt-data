The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as its signature does not include any input variables. Instead, it processes a predefined set of input data, which consists of two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are both integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. Additionally, it handles `m` segments defined by pairs of integers `(l_i, r_i)` where the constraints 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n hold true.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but it operates on the segments defined by the pairs of integers and likely returns a result based on the processing of these segments. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but processes two integers n and m along with m segments defined by pairs of integers (l_i, r_i), returning a result based on these segments.**
