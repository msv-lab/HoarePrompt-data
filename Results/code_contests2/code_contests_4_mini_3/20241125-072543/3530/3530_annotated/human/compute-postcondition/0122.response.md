According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `i` from 1 to `n`, inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to 1, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. 

However, since the current value of `i` is 1, after this iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the new value of `i`, which will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1**
