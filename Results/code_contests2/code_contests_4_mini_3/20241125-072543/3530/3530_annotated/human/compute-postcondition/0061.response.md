The line `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. This operation does not affect the other variables (`dp`, `mask`, and `j`), so we only need to reflect the change in `dp[i][mask]`.

The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` can be derived from the previous operation where it was updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. However, the actual value before the modulus operation is not provided in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state after applying the modulus operation is:
`dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`, while `dp`, `mask`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, `j` is 1**
