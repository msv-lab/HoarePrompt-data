Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, and `j` is `k + 1` (where `k` is less than `n - 1`). If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `mask` includes the bit at position `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
