The line of code modifies the `dp` list at the `i`th index and the specified `mask`. Specifically, it adds the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to `dp[i][mask]`. The `mask` variable is a bitmask where the `j`th bit is set to 1, indicating that the corresponding state is being considered.

Given the initial state:
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, meaning it can hold values for indices from 0 to `n`.
- `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, which is a binary representation where only the `n`th bit is set.
- `j` is 0, meaning we are considering the least significant bit.
- `n` is greater than 0, so there are valid indices in `dp`.
- The `i-1`th element of `a` at index `j` is equal to 1, indicating that this state is valid for the update.
- `mask` has the `j`th bit set to 1, which confirms that this computation is feasible.

The specific computation being performed is:
- The value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` is retrieved. Here, `mask ^ (1 << j)` evaluates to `mask ^ 1`, effectively toggling the least significant bit of `mask`.
- This value is then added to `dp[i][mask]`.

Since we do not have the specific initial values of `dp`, we cannot specify exact values, but we can state the effect of this operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it**.
