The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `mask` is 1
- `j` is 2

The expression `1 << j` calculates to `1 << 2`, which is `4` (binary `100`).
Then, `mask ^ (1 << j)` computes to `1 ^ 4`, resulting in `5` (binary `101`).

Therefore, the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` becomes:
`dp[2][1] += dp[1][5]`.

The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`.**
