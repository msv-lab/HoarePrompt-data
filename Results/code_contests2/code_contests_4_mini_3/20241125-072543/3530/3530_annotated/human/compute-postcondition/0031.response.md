According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is still within the range of the loop, and since the loop increments `j` with each iteration, for it to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Therefore, if the loop executes once more, `j` will be equal to the next value, which is `j + 1`. 

However, we need to ensure that `j` remains within the bounds defined by `n`. Since `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `j` needs to be adjusted to be `n - 1` (the last valid index) to ensure that the loop can execute one more time if `j` is currently less than `n - 1`.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `j` is less than `n`, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21**
