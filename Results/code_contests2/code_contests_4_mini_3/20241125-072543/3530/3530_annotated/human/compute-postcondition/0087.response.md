Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `mask` is 1, and `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it and taking modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged. If `mask` is 0, the loop will execute but no updates will occur since `mask & 1 << j` will always be false.**
