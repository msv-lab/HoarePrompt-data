The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `a`. Here, `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\), and `a` is a 2D list of integers where each element `a[i][j]` is either 0 or 1, representing the compatibility between Man \(i\) and Woman \(j\). The function returns a value based on the compatibility relationships defined in the 2D list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list a of integers (elements being either 0 or 1), representing compatibility between men and women, and returns a value based on these compatibility relationships.**
