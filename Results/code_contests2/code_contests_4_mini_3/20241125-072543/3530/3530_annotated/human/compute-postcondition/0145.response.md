According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 1 and it must still be less than `n`. 

Since `n` is at least 1, for the next iteration, we need to adjust `j` to 1. No other states need to be adjusted since `dp`, `i`, and `mask` do not affect the ability of the loop to continue.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
