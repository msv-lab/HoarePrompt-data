The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The variables `dp`, `mask`, and `j` are involved in this operation. 

Given that `mask` is 1 and `j` is 1, we calculate `mask ^ 1 << j`. The expression `1 << j` results in `2` (since `1 << 1` shifts the binary representation of `1` one position to the left). Therefore, `mask ^ 1 << j` becomes `1 ^ 2`, which equals `3` (since `1` in binary is `01` and `2` in binary is `10`, and the XOR operation gives `11` which is `3` in decimal).

Thus, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value of `dp[i - 1][3]`. The previous states of other variables are unchanged. 

The output state reflects the modification made to `dp[i][mask]`. 

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21; `mask` is 1, `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated with `dp[i - 1][3]`.**
