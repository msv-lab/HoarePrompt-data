According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from `j = 0` and going up to `j = n - 1`. Given that `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute as long as `n` is indeed greater than or equal to 1. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is 2, which does not affect the execution of the loop. The variable `mask` is 1, but it is not relevant for the loop execution itself. 

To ensure the loop executes, the relevant states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should start from 0 at the beginning of the loop's execution.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0**
