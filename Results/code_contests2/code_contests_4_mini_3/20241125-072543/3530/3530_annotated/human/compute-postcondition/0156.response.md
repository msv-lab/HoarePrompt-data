According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop executes if `n` is at least 1, since `range(n)` generates a sequence from 0 to n-1. Given that `i` is currently 2, it does not affect the loop execution directly, and `mask` is also not relevant for this loop's execution.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need `n` to be at least 1. At the start of the loop, `j` should be initialized to 0, as the loop will iterate from 0 to n-1.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `mask` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0**
