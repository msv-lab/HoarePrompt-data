According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over a range defined by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will have been incremented to the next value in the range. 

Since `j` is iterating from `0` to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be equal to `n`. Therefore, the state of `j` needs to be adjusted to `n`, and no other states need to be modified since `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `j` is `n`**
