The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. 

Initially, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0. The bitwise operation `1 << j` results in `1`, and since `mask` is 1, the expression `mask ^ 1 << j` evaluates to `1 ^ 1`, which results in `0`. 

Thus, `dp[i][mask]` becomes `dp[2][1] += dp[1][0]`. The value of `dp[1][0]` is not specified in the initial state, but it is used to update `dp[2][1]`. 

The value of `dp[2][1]` increases by whatever the value of `dp[1][0]` is. 

Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, `dp[2][1]` is updated with `dp[1][0]`.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, `dp[2][1]` is updated with `dp[1][0]`**
