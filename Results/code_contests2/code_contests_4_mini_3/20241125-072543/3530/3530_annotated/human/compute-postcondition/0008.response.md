The code appends the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to the list `a`. The `raw_input()` function accepts input, which is then split into separate strings, each converted to an integer by `map(int, ...)`. The previous state of `a` will change with the addition of these new integers. The variables `N`, `MOD`, and `n` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is a list containing integers including new integers from input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
