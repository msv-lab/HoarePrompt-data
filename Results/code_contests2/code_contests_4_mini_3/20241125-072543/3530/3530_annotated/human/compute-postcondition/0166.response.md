The line of code updates the `dp` list at the index `[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The value of `j` is `n`, so `1 << j` is a bitwise left shift of `1` by `n` positions, which creates a mask where the nth bit is set. The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` computes a new mask by flipping the nth bit of the current `mask`. 

The values of `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` are affected by this operation, but we do not know the specific values of `dp[i][mask]` or `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` beforehand. Therefore, the output state will indicate the update that occurs.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index `[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `j` is `n`**
