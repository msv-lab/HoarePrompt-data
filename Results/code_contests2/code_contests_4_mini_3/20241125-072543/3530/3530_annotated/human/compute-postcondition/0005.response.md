According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, which means the loop has executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be decremented by 1, which means it should be adjusted to `n` must be at least 1. Therefore, to execute one more time, `n` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 1 after decrementing.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
