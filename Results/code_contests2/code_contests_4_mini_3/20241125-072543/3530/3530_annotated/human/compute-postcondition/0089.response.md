According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting with `j` at 0 and incrementing it until it reaches `n - 1`. Given that `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, this ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

At the end of the last iteration (when `j` is `n - 1`), the variable `j` will hold the value `n - 1`. Before the loop starts, `i` is set to 2, which does not affect the loop execution but is part of the state. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, we need to confirm that `n` is within the specified range and that `j` is initialized to 0.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0**
