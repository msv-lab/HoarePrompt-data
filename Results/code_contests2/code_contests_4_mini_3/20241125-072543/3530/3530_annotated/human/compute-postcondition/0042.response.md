Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range of 1 to 21. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` is 2 (indicating that the second bit is set), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and subsequently taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
