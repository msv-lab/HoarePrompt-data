Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the `j`-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the sum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, followed by taking the modulo with `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
