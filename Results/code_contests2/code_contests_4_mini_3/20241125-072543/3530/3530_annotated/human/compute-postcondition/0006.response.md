The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into separate strings, converts each string to an integer, and then appends the resulting map object (which is an iterable) to the list `a`. The current state of `N`, `MOD`, and `n` does not change, and since `a` is being modified, we can state that `a` will contain additional integers as specified by the input.

Given that `a` is a list containing integers from input, the new integers from the user's input will be appended to it. However, without knowing the specific integers that will be inputted, we can only generalize the impact.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing integers including new integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
