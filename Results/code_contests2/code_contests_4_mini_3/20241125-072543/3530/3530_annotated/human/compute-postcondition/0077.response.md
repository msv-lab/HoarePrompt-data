Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the bit corresponding to `j` set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it and taking modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
