According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `j` will start at 0 for the first iteration. The current values of `dp`, `i`, and `mask` do not impact the ability of the loop to execute, but we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run.

Thus, for the loop to be executed:
1. `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. `j` starts at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0**
