The code modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. The specific values of `i`, `n`, and the contents of the `dp` list are not given, so we cannot determine exact numerical values for these variables. However, we do know that `mask` is initially equal to `1 << n` and `j` is equal to 2.

The expression `mask ^ (1 << j)` computes a new mask by flipping the j-th bit of the original mask. The values of `dp` are affected, but we cannot determine specific values due to the lack of information about `i`, `n`, and the initial state of the `dp` list.

Thus, the output state reflects the impact of the operation on `dp`, but does not specify any numerical values.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, where `mask` is `1 << n` and `j` is 2**
