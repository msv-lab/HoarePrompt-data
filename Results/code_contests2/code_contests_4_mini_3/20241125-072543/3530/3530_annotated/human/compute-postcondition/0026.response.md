Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the value of `dp[i][mask]` plus `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and then taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
