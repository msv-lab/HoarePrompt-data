Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop executes `n` times, iterating over `j` from 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is non-zero, then `dp[2][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged.**
