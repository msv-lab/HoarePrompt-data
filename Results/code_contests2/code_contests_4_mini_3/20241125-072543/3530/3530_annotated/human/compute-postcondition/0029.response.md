The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value at `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is affected by the operation. The other variables (`dp`, `n`, `mask`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21; `mask` is 1, `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated with `dp[i - 1][3]` and `dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
