Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND (1 shifted left by `j`) is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask XOR (1 shifted left by j)]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
