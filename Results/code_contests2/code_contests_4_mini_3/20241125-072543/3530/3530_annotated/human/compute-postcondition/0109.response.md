Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range of 1 to 21. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[2][3]` is updated to `dp[2][3] + dp[1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[2][3]` remains unchanged.***
