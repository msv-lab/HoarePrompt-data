According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`, which is the loop index. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, and `j` is currently at its last value of `n - 1` (since `j` starts from 0). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`, which is the condition to terminate the loop.

Since there are no modifications to `dp` or any other variables that influence the loop's execution, only the value of `j` needs to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `j` is `n`**
