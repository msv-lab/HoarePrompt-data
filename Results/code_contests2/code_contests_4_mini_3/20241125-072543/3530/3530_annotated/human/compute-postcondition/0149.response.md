According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` ranging from `0` to `n - 1`. The loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, which means the loop can execute one more time if `j` is incremented to 2. 

No other states need to be adjusted. Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `j` is now 2.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 2.**
