According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `k + 1` (where `k` is less than `n - 1`), which implies that `j` is currently at a value that allows the loop to execute once more. 

Since the loop iterates over `j` in the range of `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state of `j` should be adjusted to reflect this. 

Since `j` is currently `k + 1` and we need it to be `k + 2` for the next iteration, we can express this as `j` being `k + 2`. 

The other states (`dp` and `mask`) do not need to be adjusted because the loop's execution depends solely on the increment of `j` within the defined range.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, and `j` is `k + 2`**
