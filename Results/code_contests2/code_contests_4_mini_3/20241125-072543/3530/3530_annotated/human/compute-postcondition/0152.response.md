Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise operation `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[2][2]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[2][2]` remains unchanged.***
