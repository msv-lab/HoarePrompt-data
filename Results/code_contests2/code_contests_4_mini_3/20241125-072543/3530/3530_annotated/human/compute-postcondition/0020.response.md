According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop executes if `n` is within the range of 1 to 21. Additionally, before the loop starts, `i` needs to be initialized to 1, which is the starting value for the loop.

It is also important to note that the state of `dp` can be relevant depending on how the loop body interacts with it, but since the body is omitted, we focus on the loop execution conditions.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 21. The initial value of `i` is set to 1.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `i` is 1**
