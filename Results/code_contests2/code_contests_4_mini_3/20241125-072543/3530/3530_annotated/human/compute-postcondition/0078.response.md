According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `n`. The variable `j` is used as the loop variable and iterates from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Hence, the next state of `j` should be 1. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` being adjusted to 1 allows the loop to continue executing.

No other states, such as `dp`, `i`, `n`, or `mask`, need to be adjusted because they remain valid for the next iteration.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1**
