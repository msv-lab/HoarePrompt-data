Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range of 1 to 21. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
