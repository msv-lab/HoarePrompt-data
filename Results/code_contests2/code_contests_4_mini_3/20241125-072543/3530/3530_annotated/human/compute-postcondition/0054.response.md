According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop runs for `j` in the range from `0` to `n - 1`, meaning that for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be `n - 1`. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than `0` and initialize `j` to `0`, which is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
