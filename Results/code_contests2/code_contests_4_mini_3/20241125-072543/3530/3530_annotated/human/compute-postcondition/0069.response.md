According to the code, the loop iterates over `mask` values ranging from `1` to `1 << n - 1`. The loop will execute again if `n` is greater than 0, as it allows the range of `mask` to include at least one value. 

At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, which means it is currently equal to `2^n`, and the loop condition (`mask < 1 << n`) will not hold true in the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `mask` to be within the valid range. 

To ensure the loop can execute again:
- `mask` should be adjusted to be in the range of `1` to `1 << n - 1`.

Since `mask` is currently equal to `1 << n`, we will need to set it to `1` (the first value of the valid range).

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `mask` is equal to 1, `j` iterates from 0 to n-1**
