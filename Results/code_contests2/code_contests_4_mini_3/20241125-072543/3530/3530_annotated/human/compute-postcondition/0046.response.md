Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range of 1 to 21. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If these conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
