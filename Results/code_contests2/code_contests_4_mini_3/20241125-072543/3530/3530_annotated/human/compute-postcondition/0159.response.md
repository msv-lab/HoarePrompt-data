The line of code updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This operation affects the variable `dp[i][mask]`, but does not change any other variables. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is reduced to its remainder when divided by `MOD`. 

Since the previous values of the affected variable `dp[i][mask]` are not specified, the output state can only express that `dp[i][mask]` is now its previous value modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
