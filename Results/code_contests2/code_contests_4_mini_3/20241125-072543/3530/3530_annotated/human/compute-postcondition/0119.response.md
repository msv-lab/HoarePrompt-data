Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range of 1 to 21. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is non-zero, then `dp[2][3]` is updated by adding `dp[1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` and taking modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or `mask & (1 << j)` is zero, then `dp[2][3]` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 1 or if `j` does not iterate through the range of 0 to `n-1`, the loop does not execute, and `dp[2][3]` remains unchanged from its initial state.**
