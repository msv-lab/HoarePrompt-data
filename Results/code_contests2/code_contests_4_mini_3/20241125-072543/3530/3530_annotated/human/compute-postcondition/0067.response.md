According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. The state at the end of the last iteration provides no specific value for `j`, but it implies that the loop has iterated at least once, so `j` must be equal to `n - 1` at the end of that iteration (the maximum value for `j` in the range).

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`, which is the terminating condition for the loop. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `j` is now equal to `n`, and there are no other states that need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `j` is n**
