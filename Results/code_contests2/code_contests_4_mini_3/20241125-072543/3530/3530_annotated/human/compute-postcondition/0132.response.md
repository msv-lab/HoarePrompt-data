Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[2][1]` is updated by adding `dp[1][0]` and taking modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[2][1]` remains unchanged.***
