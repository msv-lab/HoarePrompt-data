Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
