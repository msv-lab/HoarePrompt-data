According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` in the range of `n`. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the state does not specify the exact value of `j`, so we assume `j` must be adjusted to be equal to `n - 1` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the next value of `j` must be `n` which means the loop will not execute again.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `j` is equal to `n`**
