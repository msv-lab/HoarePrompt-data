Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and the bits of `mask`. If `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, the loop executes for each `mask` from 1 to `2^n - 1`, and for each `mask`, `j` varies from 0 to `n - 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` modulo `MOD`. If `n` is less than 1, or if `mask` does not satisfy the conditions for all values of `j`, then `dp` remains unchanged.**
