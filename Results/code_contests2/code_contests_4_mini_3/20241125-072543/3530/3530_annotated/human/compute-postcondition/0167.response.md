The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is affected by the previous calculation where it was updated using `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Since no specific values for `dp`, `MOD`, `i`, or `mask` are given, we can only state that the value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified based on the modulo operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
