Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not equal to 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
