Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `mask` is 1, and `j` varies from 0 to `n - 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it, followed by taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not satisfied for a given iteration of `j`, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 1 or if the loop's range is not valid, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged.**
