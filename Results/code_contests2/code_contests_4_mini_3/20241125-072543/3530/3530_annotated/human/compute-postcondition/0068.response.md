Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, and `j` iterates from 0 to n-1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set for all `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` will not change during the loop.**
