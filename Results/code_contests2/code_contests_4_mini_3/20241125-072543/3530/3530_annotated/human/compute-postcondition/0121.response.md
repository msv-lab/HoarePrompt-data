Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`. If `mask` ranges from 1 to `2^n - 1`, and for each `mask`, if there exists any `j` such that `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` and taking modulo `MOD`. If `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, the loop will execute `2^n - 1` times (i.e., for all non-zero masks). If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged. If `mask` is 0, the loop will execute but no updates will occur since `mask & (1 << j)` will always be false for all `j`, leaving `dp` unchanged for that iteration.**
