According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3, which is the next value in the range. Additionally, since `n` is greater than 2, it also needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 3 for the next iteration. 

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `j` should be incremented to 3.
- `n` should be stated explicitly to be greater than or equal to 3, as it must support the new value of `j`.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 3.**
