The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulo of its current value with `MOD`. This operation does not change the length of the list `dp` or the structure of the values but ensures that the value of `dp[i][mask]` stays within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The other variables, `j`, `n`, and the structure of `dp`, remain unaffected.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range of 1 to 21; `j` is the next integer (current `j + 1`); `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo `MOD`.**
