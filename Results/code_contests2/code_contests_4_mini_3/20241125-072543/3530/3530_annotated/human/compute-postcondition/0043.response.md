According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, which is less than `n` (since the loop has not yet completed for all values in the range). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since there is no information provided about the current value of `j`, we can only state that `j` will be incremented to the next integer, which will still need to be less than `n`.

Thus, we can summarize the state adjustments needed:

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, j is the next integer (current j + 1)**
