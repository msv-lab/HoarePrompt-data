Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions defined in the loop for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If no conditions are met for any iterations, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
