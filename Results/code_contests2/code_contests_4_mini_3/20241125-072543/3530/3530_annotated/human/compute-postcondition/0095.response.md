To analyze the given code snippet, we note the following:

- The variable `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, which means it has at least one element (since `n` is in the range of 1 to 21).
- The variable `i` is currently 2.
- The variable `mask` is 2.
- The variable `j` is 1.

The operation `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]`. 

1. We first compute `1 << j`, which results in `1 << 1 = 2`. 
2. Next, we compute `mask ^ (1 << j)` which translates to `mask ^ 2`. Since `mask` is also 2, we have `2 ^ 2 = 0`.
3. The term `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` translates to `dp[1][0]` (because `i - 1` is 1 and `mask ^ 2` is 0).
4. Finally, we update `dp[i][mask]` which is `dp[2][2]`, so we add `dp[1][0]` to `dp[2][2]`.

The exact values of `dp[1][0]` and `dp[2][2]` are not specified in the initial state, but we note that the operation modifies the list `dp` as described.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1, and `dp[2][2]` is updated by adding `dp[1][0]` to it.**
