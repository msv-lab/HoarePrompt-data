The value at `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Given that `mask` is 1 and `j` is 0, we calculate `mask ^ 1 << j` which results in `1 ^ 1` (since `1 << 0` is 1). This equals 0. 

The value at `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, which indicates that `dp[i][mask]` will increase by the value of `dp[i - 1][0]`. The specific values for `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][0]` are not directly provided, but we acknowledge that the operation updates `dp[i][1]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is updated at index `[i][1]` by adding `dp[i - 1][0]`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [i][1] by adding `dp[i - 1][0]`**
