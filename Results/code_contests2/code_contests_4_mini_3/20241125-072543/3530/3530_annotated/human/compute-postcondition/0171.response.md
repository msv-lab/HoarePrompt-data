According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates over `mask` from `1` to `1 << n - 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `mask` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, if `n` is greater than 0, `mask` must be adjusted to the next value for the loop to execute again.

Since the last value of `mask` before exiting the loop would be `mask = 1 << n - 1`, to execute the loop one more time, `mask` should be adjusted to `1 << n` (which is out of the loop's range). However, since this is the case where we'll not be able to execute the loop again, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to have executed at least once.

Thus, if `n` is still greater than 0, we cannot adjust `mask` but we must confirm that `n` remains unchanged. If the loop has executed at least once, then `mask` would need to be adjusted to the next value, which would logically be `1 << n`.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is `1 << n`**
