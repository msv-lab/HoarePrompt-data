Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions defined in the loop for each `mask` in the range `1` to `2^n - 1` and for each `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes for all masks, and `dp[i][mask]` will reflect the cumulative updates according to the conditions related to `a[i - 1][j]` and the bitwise operations. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, leaving `dp` unchanged. Additionally, if for any `mask` there are no valid `j` such that `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged for that specific mask.**
