Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, and `j` is `k + 2`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the value of `dp[i][mask]` plus `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
