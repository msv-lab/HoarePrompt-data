The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value at `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is not explicitly provided, but it is affected by this operation.

Since `dp[i][mask]` is being updated, and assuming the previous value at `dp[i][mask]` was modified by the previous assignment, we cannot determine its exact value before this operation. However, we know that it will now be the remainder of that value when divided by `MOD`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` is now the value of `dp[i][mask]` after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, while the specifics of `dp[i][mask]` before this operation remain unknown.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
