To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to analyze the provided information closely:

1. The loop iterates over `j` in the range of `n`. The current value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration is 1.
2. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n` (i.e., `j < n`).
3. Given that `j` is currently 1, and `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `j` can be incremented for the next iteration.
4. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, so for the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted since `dp`, `i`, `n`, and `mask` remain the same across iterations unless modified within the loop body.

Thus, the necessary adjustment for the state is simply to reflect the increment of `j`.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 2**
