According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` which ranges from 0 to `n-1`. The current value of `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. This means that `j` should be 2 for the next iteration. 

Additionally, we are given that `n` is at least 1, meaning that the loop can still execute if `j` is less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3 (since `j` would be incremented to 2, and the range is from 0 to `n-1`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be updated to 2.
- `n` should be greater than or equal to 3 to ensure that the loop can execute again.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 2**
