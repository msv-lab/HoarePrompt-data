According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `k + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state of `j` needs to be adjusted to reflect this increment. Since `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue executing. 

To ensure that the loop can run again, we need to adjust `j` to `k + 3`, as this will allow the loop to potentially execute again if `k + 3` is still less than `n`. 

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, and `j` is `k + 3`**
