According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not specified, but it can be inferred that it is less than `n` since the loop is still running. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `j` was the last value it could take (which is `n - 1`), it would need to be adjusted to `n`. However, given that `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, it can also be inferred that `j` could be any value from 0 to `n-1`. 

So, if `j` was `n - 1`, it needs to be increased to `n` to exit the loop. If `j` was less than `n - 1`, it simply needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, we will assume `j` was `k`, where `k` is less than `n - 1`, and will adjust it to `k + 1` (which is still less than `n`).

The value of `n` does not need to change since it is still valid within the given range.

Thus, the state should be updated to reflect `j` as `k + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, j is `k + 1` (where `k` is less than `n - 1)**
