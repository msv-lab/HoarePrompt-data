According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `1`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to `2`. Since `n` is at least `1`, it is also necessary to ensure that `n` is greater than `2` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 2**
