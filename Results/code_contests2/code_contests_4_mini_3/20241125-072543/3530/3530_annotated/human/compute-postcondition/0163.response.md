The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulo of its current value with `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not provided, but we know that `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, and `j` is equal to `n`. This operation does not affect other variables directly, but modifies `dp[i][mask]` to ensure it remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`, while the values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo with `MOD`, other variables remain unchanged.**
