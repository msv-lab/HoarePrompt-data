According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `1 << n`, which is equivalent to `2^n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1, which it is in this case as `n` is in the range of 1 to 21.

Before the loop starts, `i` is 1, which does not impact the execution of the loop. The loop variable `mask` will start at 1 for the first iteration, so `mask` is now set to 1.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `mask` is 1**
