According to the code, the for loop iterates with `i` ranging from `1` to `n`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been equal to `n` if the loop executed its last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n + 1`. 

Additionally, since `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, it will not be altered during this iteration when `i` is `n + 1`, but we can note that the loop will not execute again as `i` will exceed `n`.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1**
