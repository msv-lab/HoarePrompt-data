According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, the loop can execute because there is at least one iteration (when `j` is 0). Before the loop starts, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, which is valid given the constraint on `n`. The variable `j` will start at 0 and increment up to `n - 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `n` should be at least 1, `j` should start at 0, and `mask` remains as 1, which does not affect the loop execution. 

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0**
