The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The current values are `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To determine the new value of `dp[i][mask]`, we need to evaluate `mask ^ 1 << j`. Here, `1 << j` is `1 << 2`, which is `4` (or binary 100). The bitwise XOR operation `mask ^ 4` results in `2 ^ 4`, which equals `6` (or binary 110). 

Therefore, we are updating `dp[2][2]` by adding `dp[1][6]` to it. The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[2][2]` is updated by adding `dp[1][6]`**.
