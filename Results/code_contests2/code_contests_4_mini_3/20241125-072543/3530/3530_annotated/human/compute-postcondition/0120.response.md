According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `mask` in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` must take on the next value in this range.

At the end of the last iteration, the `mask` variable is at its current value, which is less than \(2^n\) (since the loop runs while `mask` is less than \(1 << n\)). Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, the value of `mask` needs to be adjusted to the next integer, which is `mask + 1`.

Since `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, and the loop condition guarantees that `mask` is valid for values up to \(2^n - 1\), no further adjustments to `n` or other states are necessary.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, mask is `mask + 1`**
