The line of code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value in `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not explicitly given, but we know that `dp[i][mask]` will be modified to ensure it remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The other variables in the state are not affected. 

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
