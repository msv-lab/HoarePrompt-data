According to the code, the loop will execute for each `mask` in the range from `1` to `1 << n`. The value of `mask` will increment with each iteration of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` would have taken on the last value in the range, which is `1 << n - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be equal to `1 << n` (i.e., the loop must evaluate one more value). However, since the range is defined as `range(1, 1 << n)`, this means the loop cannot execute for `mask = 1 << n`, and thus it needs to be adjusted to allow for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `n` is defined as an integer and its value was not adjusted in the previous iteration, we do not need to change `n`. However, we must ensure that the loop state reflects the next potential value of `mask`. The only adjustment needed is to indicate that the loop has finished and `mask` would be ready for the next theoretical increment which is out of bounds for the loop.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`**
