Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, followed by taking the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` with `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` does not equal 1 or the condition fails, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
