According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be incremented.

Thus, the next state should reflect that `j` is now 1, and `n` remains greater than 0.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `mask` is equal to `1 << n`, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0**
