According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the value of `j`:
- Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to 3.

Additionally, since `n` is stated to be greater than or equal to 1, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time (to allow `j` to be 3).

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for `j` to be 3.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 3.**
