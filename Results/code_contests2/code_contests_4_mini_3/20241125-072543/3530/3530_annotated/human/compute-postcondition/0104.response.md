According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `mask`. The loop will execute for each value of `mask` in the range from 1 to `1 << n` (which is `2^n`). 

At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 2. The loop iterates from 1 to `1 << n`, and since `mask` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be incremented. 

Given that the loop continues to execute until `mask` reaches `1 << n`, we need to adjust `mask` to 3 for the next iteration, as it is the next value in the sequence. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `i` is 2, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, and they are not affected by the loop's execution.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `mask` is 3, and `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.**
