Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If these conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
