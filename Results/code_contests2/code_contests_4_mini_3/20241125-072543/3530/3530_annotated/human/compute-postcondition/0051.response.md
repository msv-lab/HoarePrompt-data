According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. The loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at `n - 1` (since the loop has completed its run from 0 to `n - 1`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`. This means that `j` will no longer satisfy the loop condition (`j < n`), and thus the loop will not execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted because the `dp` list will not change unless the loop condition is satisfied. 

Since `j` will be `n`, the state must reflect that the loop can no longer execute.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, j is n**
