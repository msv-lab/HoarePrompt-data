According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `n`, meaning that `j` can be incremented to allow the loop to execute again.

Since `j` is less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, we can simply increment `j` by 1. The variable `n` remains in the range of 1 to 21, and the condition regarding `dp` and `mask` does not require adjustment as they are not directly related to the state at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `j` is equal to `j + 1`, and `n` is in the range of 1 to 21.**
