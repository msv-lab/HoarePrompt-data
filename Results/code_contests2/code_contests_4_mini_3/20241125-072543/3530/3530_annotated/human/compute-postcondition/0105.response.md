According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, which is guaranteed since `n` is in the range of 1 to 21. The variable `j` will start from 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n - 1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `j` should be 0 as it is the initial value for the first iteration. 

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0**
