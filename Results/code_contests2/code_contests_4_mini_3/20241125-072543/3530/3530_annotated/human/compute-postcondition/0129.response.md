According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will iterate for `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1. 

Since `n` is at least 1, it allows the loop to run for `j` equal to 1. Therefore, no changes are needed for `n` or any other variables besides `j`.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1**
