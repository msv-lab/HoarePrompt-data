Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise 'AND' of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
