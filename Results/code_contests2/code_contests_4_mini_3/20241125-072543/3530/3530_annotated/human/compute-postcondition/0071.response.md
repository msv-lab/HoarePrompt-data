According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 (since it starts from 1) and we need to ensure that it can proceed to the next iteration.

If `i` is currently 1, then for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2. The variable `n` must also be in the range of 1 to 21 for the loop to be valid. No other variables need to be adjusted based on the given information.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is in the range of 1 to 21**
