The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of itself with the constant `MOD`. This operation does not affect the previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, but it ensures that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` is now the result of `dp[i][mask] % MOD`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`**
