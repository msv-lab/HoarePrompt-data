The code updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not provided, but it is affected by the operation. The state of `dp[i][mask]` will be the result of the current value modulo `MOD`, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`, where `mask` is 2.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`, where `mask` is 2**
