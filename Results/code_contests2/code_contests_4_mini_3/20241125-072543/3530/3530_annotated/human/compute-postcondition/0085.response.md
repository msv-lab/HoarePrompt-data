Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
