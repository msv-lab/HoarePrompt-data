Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. This ensures that `dp[i][mask]` retains its previous value when the condition is false.***
