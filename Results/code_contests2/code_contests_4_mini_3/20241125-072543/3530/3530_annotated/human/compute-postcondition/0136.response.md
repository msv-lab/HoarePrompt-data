Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and the result is then taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
