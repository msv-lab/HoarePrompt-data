The line `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits the input string into separate components, converts each component to an integer, and appends the resulting iterable to the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `a` is empty, and the input will determine the new contents of `a`. Since the specifics of the input are not provided, we can only state that `a` will now contain a list of integers based on the user's input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
