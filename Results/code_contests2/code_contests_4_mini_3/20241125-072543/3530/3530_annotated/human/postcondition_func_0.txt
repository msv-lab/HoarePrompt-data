The function accepts an integer input `n` (which represents the number of compatibility relationships) and a 2D list `a` consisting of integers (0 or 1) that indicates the compatibility between `n` men and `n` women. It computes and returns a value based on the number of ways to pair the men and women according to the compatibility relationships defined in `a`. The function is expected to handle inputs where `n` is between 1 and 21, inclusive. If `n` is less than 1, the function will not execute the loops that populate the compatibility list, and the returned value may not be meaningful. The function does not explicitly handle invalid inputs or errors, such as non-integer inputs or values of `n` outside the specified range.
