According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `j` in the range of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. The state indicates that the loop is processing the current value of `j` and has completed the update for that value. 

Since there are no constraints on `dp[i][mask]`, `a[i - 1][j]`, or `mask` that affect the continuation of the loop, we only need to adjust the value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at its last value (which would be `n - 1` if it has executed `n` times). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1. 

Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to `n`, which is outside the current range of `j`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged, j is n**
