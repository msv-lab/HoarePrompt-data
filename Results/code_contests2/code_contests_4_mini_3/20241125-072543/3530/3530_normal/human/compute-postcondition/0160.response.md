Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions from previous states. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` includes the `j`-th bit (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. The condition `mask < 2^n - 1` is maintained, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
