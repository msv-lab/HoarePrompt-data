Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `dp` remains unchanged except for the case where `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise condition `mask & 1 << j` holds true. In this case, `dp[2][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, followed by taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[2][mask]` remains unchanged.***
