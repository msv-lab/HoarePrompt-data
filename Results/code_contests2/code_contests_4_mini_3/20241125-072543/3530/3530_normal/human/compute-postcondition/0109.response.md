Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and subsequently taken modulo `MOD`. This operation ensures that the value of `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD` after the update. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. Additionally, `mask` is guaranteed to be less than `2^n - 1`, and `n` is greater than 0, ensuring that the bit manipulation is valid.***
