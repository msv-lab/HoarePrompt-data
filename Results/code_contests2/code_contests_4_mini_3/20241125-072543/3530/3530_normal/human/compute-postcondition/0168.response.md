Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bit corresponding to `j` in `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. This operation is valid for `j` equal to 2 and `n` greater than 2.***
