According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which ranges from 0 to `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would be at its current value, which is `n - 1`. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `j` to `n`, which means the loop will no longer execute as it will not satisfy the condition `j < n`.

Since there is no further information provided about `n`, we can only adjust the value of `j` to reflect the completion of the last iteration. The value of `dp[i][mask]` does not change as it is based on the conditions from the previous iterations.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions; j is n**
