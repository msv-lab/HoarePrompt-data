According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, with `n` being a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.

However, since we don't have a specific value for `n`, we should note that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 (to allow `j` to take the value of 2). Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `j` is now 2 and `n` is at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 2; `j` is 2**
