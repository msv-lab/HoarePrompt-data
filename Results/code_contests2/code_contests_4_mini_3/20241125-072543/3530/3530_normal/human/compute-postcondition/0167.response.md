The expression `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` to be the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but since `n` is greater than 2, `dp[i][mask]` must have been previously calculated based on valid transitions. The operation does not affect the values of `j` or `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` without specifying its exact value.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions; `j` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `dp[i][mask]` is now dp[i][mask] % MOD**
