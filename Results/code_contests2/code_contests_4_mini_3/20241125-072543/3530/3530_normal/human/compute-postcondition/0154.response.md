Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions from previous states; for each `j` in the range `n`, if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains as it was before the loop. If `mask` is such that no bits are set that correspond to a valid transition (i.e., all bits for valid `j` are 0), then `dp[i][mask]` could also remain unchanged.**
