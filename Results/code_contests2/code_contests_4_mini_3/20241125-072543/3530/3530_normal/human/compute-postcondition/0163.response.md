The statement updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. This means that `dp[i][mask]` is now effectively reduced to a value between `0` and `MOD - 1`, preserving the remainder when divided by `MOD`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0**.
