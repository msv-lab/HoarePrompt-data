According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop executes for each value of `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 1, and it must be ensured that `j` remains less than `n`. Since `n` is at least 1, this condition is satisfied. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `j` should be set to 1.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and `mask` is 1**
