Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1` where `n` is at least 2, `mask` is `1 << n` which is at least 4, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` & (1 << j) holds true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition does not hold, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
