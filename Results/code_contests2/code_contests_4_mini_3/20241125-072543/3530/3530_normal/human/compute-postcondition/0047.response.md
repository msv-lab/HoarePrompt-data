According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 2, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` should be 2. Since `n` is at least 2, this condition is satisfied, allowing the loop to run again.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `mask` is `1 << n`, `j` is 2**
