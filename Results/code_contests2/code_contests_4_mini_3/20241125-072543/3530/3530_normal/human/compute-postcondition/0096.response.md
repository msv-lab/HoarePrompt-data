The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is influenced by its previous value and the constant `MOD`. The specific values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not provided, but we know that the operation will ensure that `dp[i][mask]` stays within the bounds defined by `MOD`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`**
