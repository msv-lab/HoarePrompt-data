Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions determined by the conditions in the nested loop. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` accumulates values from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` taken modulo `MOD`. If `n` is at least 1, the outer loop for `mask` will execute `2^n - 1` times, iterating through all valid masks. If `n` is 0 or negative, or if `mask` exceeds `2^n - 1`, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. The values of `dp[i][mask]` depend on the valid transitions defined by the array `a` and the mask bits.**
