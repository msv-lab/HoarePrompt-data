The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated using the modulo operation with `MOD`. This operation ensures that the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` remains within the limits defined by `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is modified to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. The other variables (`mask`, `j`, `n`, and `a[i - 1][j]`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `mask` is less than 2^n - 1, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1**
