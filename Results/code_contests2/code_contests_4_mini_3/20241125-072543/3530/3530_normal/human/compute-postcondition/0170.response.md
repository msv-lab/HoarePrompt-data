Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions from previous states for each `j` in the range of `0` to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is `1` and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` modulo `MOD`. If `mask` is less than `2^n - 1`, the loop will execute for all `j` from `0` to `n-1`. If `n` is `0` or `mask` does not satisfy the conditions for any `j`, the loop does not execute, leaving `dp[i][mask]` unchanged. Thus, if `n` is greater than `0`, the loop executes up to `n` times. If `n` is `0`, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
