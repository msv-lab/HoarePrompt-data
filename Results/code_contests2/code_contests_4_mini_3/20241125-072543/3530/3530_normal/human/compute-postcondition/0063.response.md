According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j` in the range of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which means the loop has not executed yet for `j` values from `0` to `n - 1`. Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is at least 1.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`, and `j` is 2**
