The code appends a list of integers, which are produced by mapping the `int` function over the split input string received from `raw_input()`. The initial values of `N`, `a`, `MOD`, and `n` are unaffected by this operation. The specific integers that will be mapped from the input are not known, as they depend on user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that a new list of integers has been added to `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is a list containing mapped integers including new input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a string representing a positive integer (n >= 2), and a new list of integers has been appended to `a`.**
