The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulo of its current value with `MOD`. The specific values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not provided in the initial state, but we know that `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on its previous value.

Since `n`, `i`, and `j` are not directly modified by this operation, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `i`, and `j`, along with the updated state of `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated with `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`.**
