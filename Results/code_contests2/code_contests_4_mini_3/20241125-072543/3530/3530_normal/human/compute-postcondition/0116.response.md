The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and performing a modulo operation with `MOD`. This operation does not change the values of other variables, but it guarantees that `dp[i][mask]` stays within the bounds defined by `MOD`. 

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after applying the modulo operation, while noting that the previous values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`**
