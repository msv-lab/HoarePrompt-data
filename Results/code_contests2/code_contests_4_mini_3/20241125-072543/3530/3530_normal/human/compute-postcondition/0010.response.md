Output State: **`a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers mapped from user input if `n` is a positive integer (n >= 1). If `n` is less than 1 or not a valid positive integer, the loop does not execute, and `a` remains an empty list. `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, and `MOD` is 1000000007.**
