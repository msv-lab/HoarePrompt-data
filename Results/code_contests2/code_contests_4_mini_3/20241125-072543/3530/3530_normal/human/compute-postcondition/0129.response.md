According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, and `j` is 0. This means the loop was at the beginning of its iterations.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. After the last iteration, `j` would be updated to 1. Since `n` is at least 2, `j` being 1 means the loop can execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1**
