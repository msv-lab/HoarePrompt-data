Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions of `a[i - 1][j]` and the bitwise operation of `mask` with `1 << j` for each `j` in the range of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute exactly `n` times, with `j` taking values from `0` to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` will reflect the calculated value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` added to its previous value, taken modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or `mask & (1 << j)` is false, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0 (though the initial state specifies `n` is at least 1), the loop would not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` would remain unchanged.**
