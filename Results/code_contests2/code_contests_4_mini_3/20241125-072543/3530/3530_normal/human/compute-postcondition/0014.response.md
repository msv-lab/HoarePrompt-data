According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `i` would be 1 for the next iteration. 

Since `n` is a positive integer, `1 << n` will always be greater than 1 when `n` is at least 1. Thus, there are no additional adjustments needed for `n`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are just the values of `i` and potentially the next value of `dp[0][0]`, but since `dp[0][0]` remains unchanged and `n` remains a positive integer, the only adjustment is to increment `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `dp[0][0]` is 1, and the rest of dp remains unchanged**
