According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over the range of `n`, meaning it will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, it will allow the loop to execute with `j` equal to 1.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0**
