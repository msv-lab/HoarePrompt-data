Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. Given that `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, and `n` is at least 2, this operation will only occur under the specified conditions, ensuring that `dp[i][mask]` reflects the cumulative transitions while adhering to the modulo constraint.***
