The code appends a list of integers to `a` by mapping the integers from the input received through `raw_input()`. The variable `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, and `a` will now include the integers inputted by the user. The state of `N`, `MOD`, and `n` remains unchanged, but the list `a` is modified to include new values. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is a list containing mapped integers including new input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a string representing a positive integer (n >= 2)**
