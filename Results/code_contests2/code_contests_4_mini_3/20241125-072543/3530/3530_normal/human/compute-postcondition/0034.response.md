Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 2; `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise condition `mask & 1 << j` holds true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, followed by taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition does not hold, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
