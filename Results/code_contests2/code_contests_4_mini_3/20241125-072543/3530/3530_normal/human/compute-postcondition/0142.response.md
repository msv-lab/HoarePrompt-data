The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the `dp` array at the position `[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The `mask` variable is set to 1, which means its binary representation has only the least significant bit set (i.e., `0001`). The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` computes the XOR between `mask` and the value represented by shifting 1 to the left by `j` bits. Since `j` is 0, `1 << j` equals 1, and thus `mask ^ 1 << j` equals `1 ^ 1`, which results in 0. 

Since `dp[i - 1][0]` is being accessed, we need to assume that it has a certain value that can be added to `dp[i][1]`. The previous values of `dp[i][1]` are modified based on the transitions allowed. The exact value of `dp[i - 1][0]` is not provided, but it will be added to `dp[i][1]`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `dp[i][1]` after this addition. 

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions, `dp[i][1]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][0]`**
