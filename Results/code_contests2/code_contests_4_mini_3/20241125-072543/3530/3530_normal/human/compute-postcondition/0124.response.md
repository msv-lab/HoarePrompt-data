According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since the state indicates that `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. At the beginning of the loop, `j` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting value for the loop variable in the `range(n)`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the states need to be adjusted to indicate that `j` starts at 0.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `mask` starts at 1, `j` is 0**
