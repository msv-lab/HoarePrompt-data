Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`. Specifically, if these conditions are satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
