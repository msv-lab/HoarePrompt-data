The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values for `i`, `mask`, and `j` are given as 2, 1, and 1 respectively. The operation involves computing `mask ^ 1 << j`, which evaluates to `1 ^ 2` (since `1 << 1` equals 2). The result of this operation is `3` (because `1 XOR 2` is `3`). 

Therefore, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to include the value from `dp[1][3]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `mask`, `j`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[1][3]`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1**.
