Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `mask` is `1 << n`, `j` is 1, and if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the value of `dp[i][mask] + dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
