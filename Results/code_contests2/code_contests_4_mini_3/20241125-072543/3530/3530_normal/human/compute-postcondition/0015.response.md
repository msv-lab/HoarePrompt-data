The value of `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value `1`. Since `i` is currently `1`, `dp[0][1]` is set to `1`. The state of the other variables, including `n` and `dp[0][0]`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `dp[0][0]` is 1, and `dp[0][1]` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `dp[0][0]` is 1, and `dp[0][1]` is 1**
