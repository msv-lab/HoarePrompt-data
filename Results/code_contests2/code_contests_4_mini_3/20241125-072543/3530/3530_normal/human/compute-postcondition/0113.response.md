Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set (indicating that the transition is valid), then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and subsequently taken modulo `MOD`. The conditions ensure that `mask` remains less than `2^n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is equal to `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` does not equal 1 or the j-th bit in `mask` is not set, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
