The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Given that `mask` is less than `2^n - 1`, `j` is 0, and the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, it implies that the transition from the previous state is valid. The bit corresponding to `j` in `mask` is set, which ensures that the condition for the update is fulfilled.

This means that `dp[i][mask]` is now incremented by the value found in `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `mask ^ 1 << j` computes a new mask by toggling the j-th bit of the current mask. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions from previous states; `mask` is less than 2^n - 1, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
