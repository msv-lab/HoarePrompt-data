The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This means that the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified, while other variables remain unaffected. The exact previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is now constrained to be within the range defined by `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on its previous value and taken modulo `MOD`**
