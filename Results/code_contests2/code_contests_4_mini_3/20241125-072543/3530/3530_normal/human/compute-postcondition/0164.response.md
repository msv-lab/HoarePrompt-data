Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the jth bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
