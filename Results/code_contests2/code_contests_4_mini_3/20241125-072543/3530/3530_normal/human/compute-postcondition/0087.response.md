Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the valid conditions for each `j` in the range of `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` accumulates values from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` taken modulo `MOD`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times for `j` from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
