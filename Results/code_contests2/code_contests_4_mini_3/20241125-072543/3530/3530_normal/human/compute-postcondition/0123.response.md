According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `mask`. The loop will execute for values of `mask` starting from 1 up to `1 << n` (which is 2 raised to the power of `n`). Since `n` is at least 2, the loop will execute at least for `mask` values of 1 and 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute, the variable `mask` needs to be initialized to 1, and since `n` is at least 2, the range of `mask` will allow it to loop through values up to `3` (when `n` is 2).

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `mask` starts at 1**
