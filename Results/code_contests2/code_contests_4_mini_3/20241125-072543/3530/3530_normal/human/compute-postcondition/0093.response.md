Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid conditions, where if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
