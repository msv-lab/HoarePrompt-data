Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`, `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` added to its previous value, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
