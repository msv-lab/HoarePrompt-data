Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by summing values from `dp[i-1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` for each `j` in the range of `0` to `n-1`, where `a[i - 1][j]` equals `1` and the `j`-th bit in `mask` is set. If `n` is at least 2, the loop executes for all valid `mask` values from `1` to `2^n - 1`. If `n` is less than 2, or if `mask` contains no bits set corresponding to valid transitions (i.e., `a[i - 1][j]` is `0` for all `j`), then the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
