Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `j` is 2, and `mask` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND (`1` shifted left by `j`) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask XOR (1 shifted left by j)]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
