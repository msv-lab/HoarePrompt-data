According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 1. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3. Since `n` is at least 1, we don't need to change its condition, but we need to ensure that `n` is at least 4 for the loop to continue executing after this iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `j` is 3, `mask` is 1**
