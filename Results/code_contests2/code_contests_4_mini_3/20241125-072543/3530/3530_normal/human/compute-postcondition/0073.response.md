According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1, which is already satisfied in the provided state. The loop variable `j` will start at 0 and increment until it reaches `n - 1`. Since the initial state indicates `i` is `n`, it seems to imply that `i` is not relevant to the execution of the loop and does not need adjustment. The variable `mask` is not directly affecting the loop execution either. 

However, for clarity, we can assume that `j` should start at 0 when the loop begins, which is the default behavior for a range loop in Python. Therefore, we can finalize the state as follows.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `mask` is 1**
