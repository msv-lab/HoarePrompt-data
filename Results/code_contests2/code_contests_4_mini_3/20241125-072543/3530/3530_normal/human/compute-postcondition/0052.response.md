Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is `1 << n`, and `j` ranges from 0 to `n - 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` modulo `MOD`. If either condition fails for all `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 1, then the loop does not execute, and `i`, `mask`, and `dp` remain unchanged, with `dp` being unaffected by any updates.**
