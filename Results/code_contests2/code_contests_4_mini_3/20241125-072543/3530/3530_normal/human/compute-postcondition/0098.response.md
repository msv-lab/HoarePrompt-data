According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range specified by `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Since the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`, at the end of the last iteration, `j` must be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again.

Given that the state mentions `dp[i][mask]` being updated based on a condition involving `a[i - 1][j]`, for the next iteration to occur, `j` needs to be set to the next value, which is 1 greater than its current value. 

Therefore, if we assume `j` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` would need to be at least `n`. However, if `j` is less than `n` (which is implied since we are in the loop), we will set `j` to the next value.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition that `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`, `j` is equal to the next value in the range (which is the previous `j + 1)`**.
