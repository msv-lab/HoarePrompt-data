According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`, which means the loop cannot execute again since it exceeds the upper limit of `n + 1`. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be reset to `n`, which is the last valid value before the loop condition fails. The variable `mask` also needs to be adjusted to its previous valid state, which would be `mask` ranging from `1` to `2^n - 1`, but since we don't know its exact value at the end of the last iteration, we can indicate that it remains valid for the loop to run.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is n, `mask` ranges from 1 to 2^n - 1**
