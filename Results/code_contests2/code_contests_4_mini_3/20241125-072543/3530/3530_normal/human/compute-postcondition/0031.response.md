According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1. 

Since `j` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it is valid for the loop to execute again at `j` = 1, provided `n` is at least 2. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:

- `j` should be incremented to 1.
- `n` should remain unchanged as it is already greater than or equal to 1, and should remain valid for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `dp` remains unchanged except for the case where `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise condition `mask & 1 << j` holds true.**
