According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` in the range from `0` to `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the index `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`, which means the next increment would make `j` equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted to `n`. 

No other states need to be adjusted as the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions, `mask` is less than `2^n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is n**
