According to the code, the loop executes for values of `mask` that are in the range from 1 to `2^n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `mask` needs to be adjusted to the next value in this range. Since the current `mask` is guaranteed to be less than `2^n - 1`, we can increment `mask` by 1 to allow the loop to execute again. 

Furthermore, since the loop can only execute if `n` is greater than 0, we must ensure that `n` remains valid for the next iteration. 

No other states need to be adjusted as the loop body and transitions are not specified to affect any other states.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions, `mask` is the next value in the range (mask + 1), `n` is greater than 0**
