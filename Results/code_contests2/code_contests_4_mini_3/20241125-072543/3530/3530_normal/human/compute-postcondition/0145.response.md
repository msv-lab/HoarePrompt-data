According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `j` should be `j + 1`, and for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions; if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and the result is taken modulo `MOD`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `n` is greater than `j + 1`**
