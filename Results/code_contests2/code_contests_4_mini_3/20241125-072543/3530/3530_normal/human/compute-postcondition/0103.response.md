Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the number of valid transitions from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` where `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bit corresponding to `j` is included in `mask`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taken modulo `MOD`. If `mask` does not include the bit corresponding to `j` or if `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, or if `mask` is invalid (greater than or equal to `2^n - 1`), the loop does not execute, and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged from its previous state.**
