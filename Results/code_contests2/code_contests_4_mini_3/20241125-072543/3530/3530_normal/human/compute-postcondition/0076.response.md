The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value, which was previously incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This ensures that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. Other variables' states are not affected.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is modified to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
