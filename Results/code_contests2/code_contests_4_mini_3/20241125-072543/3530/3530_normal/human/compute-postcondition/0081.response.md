Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and `mask` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking it modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
