Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bit corresponding to `j` is set in `mask`, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and subsequently taken modulo `MOD`. Since `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `mask` starts at 1, and `j` is 0, the update reflects valid transitions where the condition holds true. If the condition does not hold, there are no changes to `dp[i][mask]`.***
