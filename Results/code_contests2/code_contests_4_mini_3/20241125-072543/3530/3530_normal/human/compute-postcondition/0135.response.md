The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but the operation ensures that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds of `MOD`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `j` is 2**
