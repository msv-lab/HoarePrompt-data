According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is a string representing a positive integer, it must be converted to an integer for the loop to determine how many times to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is still a string representing a positive integer (n >= 1). For the loop to execute one more time, the integer value of `n` must be greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred. 

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state but indicates how many times the loop has executed, we need to ensure that `n`, when converted to an integer, is at least 2. Thus, we will adjust `n` to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing mapped integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a string representing a positive integer (n >= 2)**
