According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `1 << n`. The value `1 << n` is equivalent to \(2^n\). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is a positive integer, \(2^n\) will be greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. We also need to ensure that \(2^n\) remains greater than the updated `i`. Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` has increased to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is 1, and `dp[0][1]` is 1**
