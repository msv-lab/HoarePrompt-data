The expression `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The variable `dp[i][mask]` is updated, but the values of other variables (`mask`, `n`, `j`) are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`, while the states of the other variables remain as they were.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on modulo `MOD`, `mask` is less than `2^n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is n**
