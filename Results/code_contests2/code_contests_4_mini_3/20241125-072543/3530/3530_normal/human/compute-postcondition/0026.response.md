Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `dp` has been updated such that if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` & 1 << j is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and then `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
