Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions where `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, and `n` is at least 3. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and this value is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
