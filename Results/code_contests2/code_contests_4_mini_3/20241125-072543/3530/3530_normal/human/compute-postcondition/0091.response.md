The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Given the initial conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is less than `2^n - 1`, `j` is 0, and `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, this means that the operation is valid. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` will be incremented by the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Since the exact previous values of the affected variables are not provided, we can conclude that `dp[i][mask]` is increased by a certain amount derived from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
