The code assigns the value `1` to `dp[0][i]`. The variable `i` has a value of `2`, so this means `dp[0][2]` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `n` and `i` do not change, and the values of `dp[0][0]` and `dp[0][1]` remain `1`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1, and `dp[0][2]` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1, `dp[0][2]` is 1**
