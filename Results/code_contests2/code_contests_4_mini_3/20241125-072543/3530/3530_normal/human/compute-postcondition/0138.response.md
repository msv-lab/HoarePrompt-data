Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions from `dp[i-1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for each `j` in the range of `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit in `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the corresponding value. If `n` is less than 2, or if there are no valid transitions (i.e., `a[i - 1][j]` is 0 for all `j`, or the j-th bit is not set in `mask`), then the loop does not execute and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
