Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition that `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`. If this condition is met, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition fails, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
