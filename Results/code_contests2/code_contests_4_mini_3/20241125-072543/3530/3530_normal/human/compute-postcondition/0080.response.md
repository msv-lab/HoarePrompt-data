The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and computing the remainder when it is divided by `MOD`. The values of `n`, `j`, and `mask` do not change, but the value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified based on its previous value. Since we do not have the specific value of `dp[i][mask]` before the operation, we can only state that it is updated.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `mask` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on its previous value mod MOD.**
