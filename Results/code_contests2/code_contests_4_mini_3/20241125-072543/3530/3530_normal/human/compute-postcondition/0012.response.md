According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a valid positive integer, ensuring that `1 << n` (which is equivalent to `2^n`) evaluates to at least 1. If `n` is less than 1 or invalid, the loop will not execute because `1 << n` would yield 0 or an undefined state for `dp`. 

Assuming `n` is a positive integer, `dp` is initialized correctly, and the loop will start iterating. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 since the range function starts counting from 0.

Hence, to ensure the loop can execute, the states need to be set as follows: `n` must be a positive integer, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `dp` is a list with dimensions (n + 1) x (2^n) initialized to 0**
