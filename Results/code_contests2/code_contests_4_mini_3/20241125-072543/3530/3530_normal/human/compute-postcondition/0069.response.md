According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mask`, which iterates from `1` to `1 << n` (exclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `mask` must be less than `1 << n` for the loop to execute again. Since `mask` starts from `1` and goes up to `1 << n - 1`, the last value of `mask` after the previous iteration must be `1 << n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be adjusted to `1 << n`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions described, and `n` is already at least 1.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on conditions, `mask` is `1 << n`**
