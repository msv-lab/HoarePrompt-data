According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, and `j` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. The value of `n` remains at least 1, which is still sufficient for the loop to run.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`, `j` is 1**
