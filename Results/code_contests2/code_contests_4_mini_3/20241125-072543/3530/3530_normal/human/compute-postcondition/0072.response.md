According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `mask`, which ranges from 1 to `1 << n` (or `2^n - 1`). Given that `n` is at least 1, the range for `mask` is valid, and the loop will execute starting from 1 up to `2^n - 1`. 

At the beginning of the loop, `mask` should be adjusted to the starting value of the range, which is 1. The variable `i` does not affect the execution of the loop in this context, as it is not used within the loop itself.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed correctly, we need to ensure that `mask` starts at 1.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is n, `mask` is 1**
