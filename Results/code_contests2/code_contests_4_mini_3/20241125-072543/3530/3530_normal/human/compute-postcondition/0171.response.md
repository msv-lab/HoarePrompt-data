According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `mask` in the range from `1` to `2^n - 1`. The loop will execute again if `mask` can take on the next value in this range, specifically `mask + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions for each `j`. Since `mask` is currently less than `2^n - 1`, we can increment `mask` by 1 for the next iteration.

Thus, the required adjustments are:
- `mask` is currently less than `2^n - 1`, so it needs to be adjusted to `mask` is equal to `2^n - 1` for the loop to execute one more time.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `n` is assumed to be greater than `0` for the loop to execute in the first place.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions from previous states, `mask` is equal to `2^n - 1`**
