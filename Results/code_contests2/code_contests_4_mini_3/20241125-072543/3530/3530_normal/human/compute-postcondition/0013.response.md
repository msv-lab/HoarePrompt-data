The code assigns the value `1` to the element at the 0th row and the ith column of the `dp` list. The value of `i` is currently `0`. Therefore, `dp[0][0]` is set to `1`. The dimensions of the `dp` list are `(n + 1) x (2^n)`, but only the specific element `dp[0][0]` is affected. The other values in the list remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `dp[0][0]` is 1, and the rest of dp remains unchanged**
