Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions; if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and this updated value is taken modulo `MOD`. If either condition is not satisfied (i.e., `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or the j-th bit of `mask` is not set), `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
