According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2. Additionally, since `j` is now 2, it is necessary for `j` to be less than `n`, which means `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
