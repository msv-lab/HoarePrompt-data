According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute because `range(n)` will generate a sequence of indices from 0 to `n-1`. However, the starting value of `i` (which is `n + 1`) is not relevant to the loop execution itself, but it indicates that it is outside the range of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will take values from `0` to `n-1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we must ensure that `j` starts at `0` and iterates up to `n-1`. Therefore, the relevant state adjustments are:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`, `j` is 0**
