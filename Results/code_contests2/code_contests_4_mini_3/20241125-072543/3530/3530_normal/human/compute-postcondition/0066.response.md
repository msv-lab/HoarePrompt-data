Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is `1 << (n - 1)`, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
