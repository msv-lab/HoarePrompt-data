The statement updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The transition depends on the condition that `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and that the j-th bit of `mask` is set. The previous values of the affected variables, `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, are assumed to be known in this context, but the specific values are not provided.

This operation increases `dp[i][mask]` based on the value from the previous state, and the `MOD` operation ensures the result remains within the specified bounds. The variable `j` is incremented, and it is implied that `n` is greater than `j + 1`, allowing the loop to potentially continue.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on previous values and valid transitions; the result is taken modulo `MOD`**.
