The statement updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The value of `j` is `n`, which means `1 << j` shifts `1` left by `n` bits, creating a new mask. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are used to compute the new value, but since we do not have specific values for those variables, we can only describe the operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and `j` is `n`**.
