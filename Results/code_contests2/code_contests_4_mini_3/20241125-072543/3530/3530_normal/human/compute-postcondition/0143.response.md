The line `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value at `dp[i][mask]` to be the remainder when divided by `MOD`. This operation ensures that the value does not exceed the limits of typical integer representations, especially in competitive programming scenarios.

The previous state indicates that `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions and that `dp[i][1]` has been increased by `dp[i - 1][0]`. However, the specific previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not given. 

Since the operation is a modulo operation, we can conclude that `dp[i][mask]` is now the same value as before, but reduced by the modulo if it was larger than `MOD`. The output state will reflect the modified state after this operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
