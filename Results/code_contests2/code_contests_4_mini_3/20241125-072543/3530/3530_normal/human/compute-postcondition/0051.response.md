According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which means the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. 

Currently, `j` is 2, which is the last iteration for a range of `n` (where `n` is at least 2), since `j` will take values from 0 to `n - 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be reset to 0, and `i` should remain `n + 1`, as we are not changing `i` in the context of this loop execution.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is `1 << n` which is at least 4, `j` is 0**
