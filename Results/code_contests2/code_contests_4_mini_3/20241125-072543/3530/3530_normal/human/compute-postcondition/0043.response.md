According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `0` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least `1`, and `j` is `0`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. 

Since the loop starts with `j = 0`, it will execute for `j = 0` and increment on the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be `1`, and `n` must be at least `2` (to ensure that the range for `j` still allows for further iterations).

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `mask` is `1 << n`, and `j` is 1**
