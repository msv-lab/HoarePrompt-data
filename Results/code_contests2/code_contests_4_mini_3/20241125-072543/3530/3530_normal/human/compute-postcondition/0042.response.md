Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `mask` is `1 << n`, and `j` is 0. If the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` is true and `mask & 1 << j` results in a true value, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
