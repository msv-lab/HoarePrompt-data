Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taken modulo `MOD`. If `mask` is such that it does not have any bits set corresponding to valid transitions, the loop won't execute and `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `dp[i][mask]` remains unmodified. The `mask` is guaranteed to be less than `2^n - 1`, ensuring valid bit manipulation.**
