The statement `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` based on the previous value `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The operation suggests that the current state of `dp[i][mask]` is being incremented by the value from a previous state in the dynamic programming table, specifically when the bit corresponding to `j` is toggled (using the bitwise XOR operation) in the `mask`.

Since `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`, this means that the condition to update `dp[i][mask]` is satisfied, and thus a valid contribution to this state is added from the previous state.

The other variables and states do not change, so we only reflect the updated state of `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
