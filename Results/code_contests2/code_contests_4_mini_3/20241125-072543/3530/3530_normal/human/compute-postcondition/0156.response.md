According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1; otherwise, it will not run at all. Additionally, since the loop variable `j` will start from 0, it will be initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop. The statement mentions that `mask` is less than \(2^n - 1\), which suggests that `mask` is valid for the loop execution, but it does not directly affect the looping mechanism itself.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and that `j` starts at 0.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on valid transitions from previous states, `mask` is less than 2^n - 1, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
