The code executes a print statement that outputs 'YES'. The previous values of the affected variables `p`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's', and the function prints 'YES'.

Output State: **`p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's', and the function prints 'YES'**
