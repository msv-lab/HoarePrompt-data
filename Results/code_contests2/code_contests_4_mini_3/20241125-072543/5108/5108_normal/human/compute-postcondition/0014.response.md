The value of `a` is assigned the string 'tstr123', which is already equal to its current value. Therefore, the state of `a` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. The function also prints 'YES', but this does not alter any variable states.

Output State: **`p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's', and the function prints 'YES'**
