The variable `a` is assigned the value 'tstr123'. The other variables (`p`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. The value of `i` is not explicitly stated after this change, but since `i` is defined as the first character in `a`, it becomes 't'. The output remains 'YES' as specified in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 't', and the output is 'YES'.

Output State: **`p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 't', and the output is 'YES'**
