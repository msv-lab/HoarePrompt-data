Postcondition: ***`p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and `i` is 's'. If `i` is one of 'H', 'Q', or '9', the function prints 'YES', sets `a` to 'tstr123', and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not in this set, no changes are made to `a`, and the program continues without printing or breaking.***
