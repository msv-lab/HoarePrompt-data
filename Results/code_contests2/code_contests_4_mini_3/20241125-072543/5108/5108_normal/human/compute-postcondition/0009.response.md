The variable `a` is assigned the value `'tstr123'`. The previous state of the variables indicates that `p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters, `a` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `a`. After the assignment, `a` now holds the value `'tstr123'`, which does not affect `p` or `i` directly. However, `i` is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, so its value remains unknown. The function also prints 'YES', but this does not change any variable states. 

Therefore, the output state is: `p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and `i` remains undefined.

Output State: **`p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and `i` remains undefined**
