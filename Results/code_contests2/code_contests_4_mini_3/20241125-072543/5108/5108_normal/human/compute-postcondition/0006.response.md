Postcondition: ***`p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters, `a` is a non-empty string. If the first character `i` of `a` is either 'H', 'Q', or '9', the output is 'YES', `a` is updated to 'tstr123', and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not one of these characters, no changes are made to `a`, and the output is not specified.***
