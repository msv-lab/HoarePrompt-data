Postcondition: ***If `a` contains at least one character that is either 'H', 'Q', or '9', the loop will print 'YES', set `a` to 'tstr123', and exit the loop. If `a` is empty or does not contain any of these characters, the loop will not execute, leaving `a` unchanged, and if the subsequent condition checks if `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', it will print 'NO'.***
