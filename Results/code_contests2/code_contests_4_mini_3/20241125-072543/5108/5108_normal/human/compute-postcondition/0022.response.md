The function `func` accepts a parameter `p`. `p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters, where each character has an ASCII code between 33 and 126 inclusive. The function processes the string `p`, considering only the characters 'H', 'Q', '9', and '+' as valid instructions, while other characters are ignored. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a string `p` and process specific instructions from it, ignoring any irrelevant characters.
