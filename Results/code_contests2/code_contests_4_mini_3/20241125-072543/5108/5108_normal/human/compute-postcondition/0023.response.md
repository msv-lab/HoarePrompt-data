Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input from the user and checks if it contains any character that is either 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If it does, it prints 'YES' and sets a variable to 'tstr123'. If none of these characters are found, it prints 'NO'. If the input string is empty, it does not print anything and simply returns.**
