Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a string input from the user. It checks if the input contains at least one character from the set ['H', 'Q', '9']. If it does, it prints 'YES' and sets the internal variable `a` to 'tstr123'. If none of these characters are present, or if the input is empty, it prints 'NO'. Thus, the function outputs 'YES' if 'H', 'Q', or '9' is found in the input and 'NO' otherwise. **
