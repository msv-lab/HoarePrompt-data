Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is updated to 'tstr123' if the first character `i` of `a` is either 'H', 'Q', or '9', and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not in ['H', 'Q', '9'], `a` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing without making any modifications to `a`.***
