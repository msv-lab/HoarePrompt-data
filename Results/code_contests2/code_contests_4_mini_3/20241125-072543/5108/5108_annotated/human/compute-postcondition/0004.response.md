The variable `a` is assigned the value `'tstr123'`. The previous variable `i` was either 'H', 'Q', or '9', but after the assignment, `i` no longer holds its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and `i` is no longer defined in this context.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and `i` is no longer defined in this context.**
