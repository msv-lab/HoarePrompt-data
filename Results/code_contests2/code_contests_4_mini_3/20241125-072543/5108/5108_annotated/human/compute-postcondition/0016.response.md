Postcondition: ***`a` is a string with at least 2 characters, and `i` is a character from `a` that is not 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If `i` is one of 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program outputs 'YES', assigns 'tstr123' to `a`, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since `i` cannot be 'H', 'Q', or '9' by precondition, this case will not occur, and therefore no changes to `a` or the program flow will happen.***
