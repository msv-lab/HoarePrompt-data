Postcondition: ***`p` is a string of 1 to 100 characters. If `a` does not contain at least one character from the set ['H', 'Q', '9'], or if `a` is an empty string, then `a` remains unchanged and the output is not 'YES'. If `a` has been updated to 'tstr123', then `a` is equal to 'tstr123' and the output is 'NO'. If `a` is not equal to 'tstr123' and has not been updated, the output is also 'NO'.***
