The function accepts no parameters, reads an integer `n` from input, then reads a permutation `p` of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of 0s and 1s. It computes the number of connected components based on the indices in `p` and evaluates whether all elements in `b` are zero. The function returns 0 if there is only one component, otherwise it returns the number of components found, plus 1 if the sum of elements in `b` is zero. If `n` is 0, it simply returns 0.
