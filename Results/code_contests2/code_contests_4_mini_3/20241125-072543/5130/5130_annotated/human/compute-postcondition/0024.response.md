The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` has been incremented by 1 from its initial state, but since its exact value is not specified, we cannot determine the specific value of `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros with `comps[i]` updated to `col`; `i` is incremented by 1; `col` is increased by 1; `j` is assigned the value of `i`**.
