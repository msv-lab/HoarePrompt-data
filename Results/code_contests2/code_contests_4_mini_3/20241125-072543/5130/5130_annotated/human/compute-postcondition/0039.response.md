The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is equal to its previous value plus 1, which must be less than `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is equal to the previous value of `i + 1`; `col` is the previous value increased by 1; `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`; `j` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is equal to the previous value of `i + 1`; `col` is the previous value increased by 1; `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`; `j` is equal to `i`**
