To analyze the output state of the loop, we will consider how the loop operates based on the provided initial state and code. 

**Initial State:** 
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. 
- `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`. 
- `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, where `comps[i]` will be updated to `col` during the loop execution.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though its initial value is not specified, we know it will be at least 1).
- `col` is increased by 1.
- `j` is assigned the value of `i`.

**Code of the loop:**
``` 
while comps[p[j]] == 0:
    j = p[j]
    comps[j] = col
```

### Loop Execution Analysis:
- The loop will continue executing as long as `comps[p[j]]` equals 0. 
- Each iteration updates `j` to the value `p[j]` and assigns `comps[j]` to `col`.
  
### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `comps[p[j]]` is initially non-zero:** 
   - The loop will not execute at all. 
   - `j` remains unchanged and `comps` will consist entirely of zeros.

2. **If `comps[p[j]]` is zero:** 
   - The loop will execute multiple times until `comps[p[j]]` becomes non-zero. 
   - As the loop executes, `j` will be updated to traverse through the indices defined by `p`, and `comps` will be updated to reflect the value of `col` at those indices.

### Output State after Loop Execution:
- If the loop executes:
  - `j` will eventually point to an index `k` where `comps[k]` is non-zero, either because it was updated in this loop or because of previous updates.
  - `comps` will have several indices set to `col`, specifically those that were reached by following the links in `p` starting from the initial `j`.

- If the loop does not execute:
  - `j` remains equal to the initial value assigned from `i`.
  - `comps` remains unchanged, all zeros.

### Edge Cases:
- If `i` starts at a point that immediately leads to a non-zero value in `comps`, the loop will not execute at all.
- If `p[j]` leads to a cycle or points to itself and never reaches a non-zero value in `comps`, it could potentially lead to an infinite loop if not properly controlled (though this is unlikely with proper input constraints).

### Final Output State:
Considering all the possible scenarios:

Output State: **`if comps[p[j]] is non-zero before the loop starts then j is the initial value of i, comps remains all zeros. if comps[p[j]] is zero, j will point to the first index where comps becomes non-zero, and all accessed indices in comps will be set to col.`**
