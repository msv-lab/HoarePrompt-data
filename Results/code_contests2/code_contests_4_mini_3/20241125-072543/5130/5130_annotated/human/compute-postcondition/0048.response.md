According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `comps[p[j]]`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`, which means that `comps[p[j]]` may need to be equal to 0 for the loop to execute again.

To ensure that `comps[p[j]]` remains equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `comps[p[j]]`. Since `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`, and `col` is the previous value increased by 1, we need to ensure that `comps[p[j]]` does not change and remains equal to 0.

Thus, we must ensure that `comps[p[j]]` is still equal to 0 after the last iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is equal to the previous value of `i + 1; col` is the previous value increased by 1; `j` is updated to `p[j]`; `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0**
