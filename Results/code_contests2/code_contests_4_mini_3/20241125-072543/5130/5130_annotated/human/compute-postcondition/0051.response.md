According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the previous value of `i + 1`, which means `i` is now one less than `n` (i.e., `i` is less than `n`). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since `i` is already at its maximum value for the current iteration, it will be incremented to `n` in the next iteration. The loop condition will still hold true because `i` will be equal to `n`, and therefore the loop will terminate.

No other states need to be adjusted because the values of `col`, `comps`, and their states are not affected by the loop's execution condition, as they would only change within the loop body.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is equal to `n`, `comps` retains its original state, `col` remains unchanged**
