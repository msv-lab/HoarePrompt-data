The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The variable `j` has a previous value that is determined by its last assignment, which is the value of `i`. However, since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, `j` is updated to the value stored in `p` at the index of the previous `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

The output state will therefore reflect the new value of `j`, which is now `p[j]`, and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros with `comps[i]` updated to `col`; `i` is incremented by 1; `col` is increased by 1; `j` is now `p[j]`.**
