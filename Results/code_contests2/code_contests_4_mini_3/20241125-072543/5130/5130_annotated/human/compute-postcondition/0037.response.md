The value of `col` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `col` is unknown. The values of `n` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is equal to the previous value of `i + 1` (which must be less than `n`); `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is equal to the previous value of `i + 1` (which must be less than `n`); `col` is increased by 1.**
