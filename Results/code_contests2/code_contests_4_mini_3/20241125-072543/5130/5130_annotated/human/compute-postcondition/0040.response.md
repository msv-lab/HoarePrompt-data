The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Since `j` is equal to `i`, the new value of `j` will be whatever `p[i]` is. The values of `n`, `i`, `col`, and `comps[i]` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `j` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is equal to the previous value of `i + 1`; `col` is the previous value increased by 1; `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`; `j` is now equal to `p[i]`**
