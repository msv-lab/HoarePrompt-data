According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Given that `n` is a positive integer and the loop is defined to iterate from 0 to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. 

Since `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, it is now equal to `i + 1`. Therefore, to allow the loop to run again, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`, and we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is equal to the previous value of `i + 1` (which must be less than `n`)**
