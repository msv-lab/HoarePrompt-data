The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The previous state indicates that `comps[p[j]]` is 0 and `comps[j]` was previously equal to `col`. Since `j` is now `p[j]`, the value of `comps[j]` is updated with the value of `col`. The states of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is now `p[j]`, and `comps[j]` is equal to `col`.

Output State: **`comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is now `p[j]`, and `comps[j]` is equal to `col`**
