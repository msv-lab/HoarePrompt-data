The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The previous value of `comps[p[j]]` is 0, and `j` is now updated. The state of `comps` is not directly affected in this line, but we know that `comps[j]` is equal to `col`. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `j` and the existing values of `comps` and `col`.

Output State: **`comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `j` is now `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is equal to `col`**
