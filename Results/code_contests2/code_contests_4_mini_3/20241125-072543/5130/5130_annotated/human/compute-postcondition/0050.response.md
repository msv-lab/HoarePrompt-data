Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is equal to the previous value of `i + 1` (which is less than `n`). If `comps[i]` is 0, then `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is set to `col`, and `j` is initialized to `i`. The while loop updates `j` based on `p[j]` until `comps[p[j]]` is not 0, setting `comps[j]` to `col` for each iteration where `comps[p[j]]` is 0. If `comps[i]` is not 0 before the loop starts, `col` remains unchanged, and `comps` retains its original state.***
