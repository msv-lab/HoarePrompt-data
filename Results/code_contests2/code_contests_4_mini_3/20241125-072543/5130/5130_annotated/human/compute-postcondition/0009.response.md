The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers containing only the input integers; `comps` is a list with the first element updated to 1; `col` is 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.
