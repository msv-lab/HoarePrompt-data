The variable `b` is assigned the values produced by `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which reads a line of input, splits it into separate strings, converts each string to an integer, and creates an iterable of integers. The list `b` will contain integers (0s and 1s) based on the input provided. The values of `n` and `p` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` based on the input permutation; `b` is a list of integers containing only the input integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` based on the input permutation; `b` is a list of integers containing only the input integers.**
