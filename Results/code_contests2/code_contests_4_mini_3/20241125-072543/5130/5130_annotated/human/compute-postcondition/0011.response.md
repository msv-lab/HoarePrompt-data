The value of `comps[j]` is updated to `col`. Given that `j` is 0 and `col` is 1, `comps[0]` will be assigned the value 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers containing only the input integers; `comps` is a list with the first element updated to 1; `col` is 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers containing only the input integers; `comps` is a list with the first element updated to 1; `col` is 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 0 and `comps[0]` is updated to 1.**
