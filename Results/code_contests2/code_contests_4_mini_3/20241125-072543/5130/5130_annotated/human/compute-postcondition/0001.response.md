The variable `p` is assigned a list comprehension that converts each value `v` from the input to an integer, subtracts 1 from it, and collects these values into a list. The input is expected to be a sequence of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, the input will contain `n` integers.

The output state will include the variable `p`, which reflects the transformation of the input values into zero-based indices. The other variables `n` and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` based on the input permutation; `b` is a list of integers containing only 0s and 1s with a length equal to `n`.**
