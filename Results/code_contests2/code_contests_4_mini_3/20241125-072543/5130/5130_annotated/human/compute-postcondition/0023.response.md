The value of `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1, so it now holds a value of `i + 1`. The variable `col` has been increased by 1, so it now holds a value of `col + 1`. The previous value of `comps` at index `i` will be updated to the new value of `col`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros with `comps[i]` updated to `col`; `i` is incremented by 1; `col` is increased by 1.
