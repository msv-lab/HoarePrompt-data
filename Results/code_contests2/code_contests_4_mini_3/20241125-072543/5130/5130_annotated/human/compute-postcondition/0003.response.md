The code initializes a list `comps` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The previous values of `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of the list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` based on the input permutation; `b` is a list of integers containing only the input integers; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros.**
