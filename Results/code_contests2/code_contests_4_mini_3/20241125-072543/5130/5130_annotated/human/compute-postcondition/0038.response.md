The value of `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `col` has been increased by 1 and `i` is less than `n`, we can deduce that the value of `comps[i]` will be the new value of `col`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state indicates the updated values of `comps[i]` and the previous values of `n`, `i`, and `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is equal to the previous value of `i + 1` (which must be less than `n`); `col` is the previous value increased by 1; `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`.**
