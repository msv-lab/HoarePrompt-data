The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\).
- `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `b` is a list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, with a length equal to `n`.

The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the relationships and constraints of the parameters. However, specific return values based on conditions are not provided in the output description. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept a positive integer `n`, a permutation `p` of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` of integers containing only 0s and 1s, and then perform some operations which lead to a return value that is not explicitly detailed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a permutation p of integers from 1 to n, and a list b of integers containing only 0s and 1s, and returns a result based on these parameters.**
