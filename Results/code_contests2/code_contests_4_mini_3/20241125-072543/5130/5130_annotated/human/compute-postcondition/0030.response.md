According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. For the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` must still be equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, which means it satisfies the loop condition, allowing it to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, and `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`**
