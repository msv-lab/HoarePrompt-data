Output State: **`if comps[p[j]]` was 0 initially, then after the loop executes, `comps[j]` will be set to 1 for every index `j` encountered via the list `p` until a `j` is found such that `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0. The final value of `j` will be the last index visited before encountering a non-zero in `comps`. If `comps[0]` was already 1 initially, the loop will not execute, and `j` will remain 0, while `comps` will remain unchanged.**
