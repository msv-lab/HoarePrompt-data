The code assigns the value of `col` to `comps[j]`. The previous value of `comps[p[j]]` is 0, indicating that the index `j` derived from `p[j]` does not affect the assignment directly. The state of `comps[j]` will now reflect the value of `col`. Therefore, the output state is: `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, and `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.

Output State: **`comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, and `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`**
