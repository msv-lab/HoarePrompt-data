Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, and `comps`, initially a list of `n` zeros, will have the index `i` updated to `col`, which is incremented by 1 if `comps[i]` was initially 0. The loop will set `comps[j]` to `col` for every index `j` visited that satisfied `comps[p[j]] == 0`, stopping when a non-zero value is encountered in `comps`. If `comps[i]` was already non-zero at the start, `comps` and `col` remain unchanged, and `j` will stay as 0. The final value of `j` will be the last index visited before a non-zero `comps` entry was found.***
