The statement `comps[j] = col` assigns the value of `col` to the index `j` in the list `comps`. The initial state indicates that `comps` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as `0`, and specifically, it states that `comps[2]` is `1`. The value of `j` is `p[2]`, which is an unknown index derived from the permutation `p`. 

Since `comps[j]` will be updated to `col`, and `col` has a value of `1`, we need to consider that the value of `j` could be any index from `0` to `n-1`, depending on the specific permutation `p`. Hence, the value at `comps[j]` will change to `1`, while all other indices of `comps` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is that `comps[j]` is set to `1`, and the value of `comps[2]` remains `1` (as it was initialized to `1`).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `j` is now `p[2]`, `p` is a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps` is a list of length `n` with `comps[j]` set to 1, `comps[2]` is 1, and `col` is 1**.
