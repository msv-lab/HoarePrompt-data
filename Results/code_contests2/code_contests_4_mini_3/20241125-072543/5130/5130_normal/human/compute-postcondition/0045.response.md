According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `comps[p[j]]`. The loop will execute as long as `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, we have `comps[j]` equal to 1, which means `comps[p[j]]` must also be equal to 1 since `j` is equal to `p[2]`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, it is necessary that `comps[p[j]]` is adjusted to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `j` is `p[2]`, `p` is a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps[j]` is 1, `comps[2]` is 1, and `comps[p[j]] is 0`**
