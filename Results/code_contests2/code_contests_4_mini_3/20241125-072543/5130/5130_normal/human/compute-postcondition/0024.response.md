The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. Therefore, after execution, `j` will also be 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `b`, `comps`, and `col`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps` is a list of length `n` with all elements as 0 except for `comps[1]`, which is 1, `col` is 1, `j` is 1**
