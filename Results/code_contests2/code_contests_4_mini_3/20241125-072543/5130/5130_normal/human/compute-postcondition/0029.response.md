The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, which is currently 1. The variable `j` has been updated to `p[j]`, and since `comps[j]` was initially 0 for some `j`, it will now be set to 1. The previous state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps[j]` is now 1, `col` is 1, and `j` is updated to `p[j]`.
