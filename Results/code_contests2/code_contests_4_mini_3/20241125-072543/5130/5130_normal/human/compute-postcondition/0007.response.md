The value of `col` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0. Therefore, after execution, `col` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as `0`, `col` is 1, and the element at index `i` of `comps`, which is `comps[0]`, is equal to 0.**
