Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as `0`, `col` is 0. The element at index `i` of `comps`, which is `comps[0]`, is equal to 0.***
