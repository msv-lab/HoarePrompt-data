In this case, the variable `col` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `col` is 0, so after the execution, `col` will be 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `p`, `b`, and `comps`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as `0`, `col` is 1**
