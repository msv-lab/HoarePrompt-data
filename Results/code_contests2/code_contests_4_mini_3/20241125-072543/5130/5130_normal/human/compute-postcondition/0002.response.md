The statement `b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into separate strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting map object to `b`. Since `raw_input()` is expected to give a list of integers, `b` will contain integers based on the input provided. The other variables, `n` and `p`, are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of values from 0 to n-1; `b` is a map object containing integers from input.**
