The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i`. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is 0, after execution, `j` will also be 0. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps` is a list of length `n` containing elements as 1 at index 0 and 0 elsewhere, `col` is 1, `comps[0]` is 1, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps` is a list of length `n` containing elements as 1 at index 0 and 0 elsewhere, `col` is 1, `comps[0]` is 1, and `j` is 0**
