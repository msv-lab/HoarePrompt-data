Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements, a list `p` which is a permutation of values from 1 to n, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones. It counts the number of connected components in the permutation defined by `p`, and if there is only one connected component, it returns 0. If there are multiple components, it returns the count of those components plus one if the sum of `b` is zero; otherwise, it returns only the count of components. The function does not return the maximum value from list `p` as stated in the annotations.**
