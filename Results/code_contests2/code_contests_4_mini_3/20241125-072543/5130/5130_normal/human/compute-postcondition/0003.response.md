The variable `comps` is assigned a list that consists of `n` elements, all initialized to `0`. The statement creates a list comprehension that iterates over a range of `n` and assigns `0` to each element. The values of `n`, `p`, and `b` are not directly affected by this operation, but the new list `comps` is created. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of values from 0 to n-1; `b` is a map object containing integers from input; `comps` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of values from 0 to n-1; `b` is a map object containing integers from input; `comps` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as `0`.**
