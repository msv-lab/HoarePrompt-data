Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps` is a list of length `n` containing all elements as `0`, and `col` is 0. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is set to `col`, and all indices reachable from `i` through `p` that have `comps` value of 0 are also updated to `col`. If `comps[i]` is not 0, `comps` remains unchanged except for `comps[i]`, which is still set to 1. After execution, `j` reflects the last updated index from `p`.**
