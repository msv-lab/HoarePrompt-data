Output State: **`if comps[p[j]] is 0, then j will be updated through the permutation p until comps[j] is not 0. At the end, comps[j] will be set to 1 and remain unchanged for previously visited indices. If comps[p[j]] is already 1 at the start, the loop will not execute and comps will remain unchanged, with all elements still 0 except comps[2] which is 1.`**
