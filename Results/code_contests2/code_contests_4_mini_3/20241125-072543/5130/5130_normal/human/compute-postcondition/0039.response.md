The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `p` is a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as `0`, `comps[2]` is 1, and `col` is 1.
