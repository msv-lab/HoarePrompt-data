The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. Here, `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. The parameter `p` is a list of integers that represents a permutation of values from 1 to `n`, and `b` is a list of integers consisting only of zeros and ones with a length of `n`. 

The function's output is determined by several cases based on the values in the input parameters:

- Case 1: If any value in list `b` is 1, the function returns the index (1-based) of the first occurrence of 1 in `b`.
- Case 2: If all values in list `b` are 0, the function returns the maximum value from the permutation list `p`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process the parameters `n`, `p`, and `b`, returning the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `b` if present, or the maximum value from the list `p` if `b` contains only zeros. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer), p (a list of integers representing a permutation of values from 1 to n), and b (a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones). It returns the index of the first occurrence of 1 in b if present; otherwise, it returns the maximum value from the list p.**
