The value of `col` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `col` is 0, so after execution, `col` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `p`, `b`, `comps`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `p` is a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as `0`, and `col` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `p` is a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as `0`, and `col` is 1**
