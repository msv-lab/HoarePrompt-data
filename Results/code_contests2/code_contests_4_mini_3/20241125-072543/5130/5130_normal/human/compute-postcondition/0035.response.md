Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, `p` is a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as `0`, and `col` is 0. If `comps[i]` is 0, `col` is incremented by 1 and `comps[i]` is set to `col`. The variable `j` is initialized to `i`, and while `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is updated to `p[j]` and `comps[j]` is set to `col`. If `comps[i]` is already non-zero, `comps` will remain unchanged, and `j` will still equal `i`. Thus, after execution, all elements in `comps` corresponding to the indices reached via the permutation `p` starting from index `i` will be set to the same incremented value of `col`, while other elements will remain 0.***
