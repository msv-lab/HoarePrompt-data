Output State: **`if comps[p[j]] is 0, then comps[j] will be set to 1, and j will be updated to the value of p[j]. The loop continues until comps[p[j]] is no longer 0. At the end, if the loop executes, comps will have elements set to 1 corresponding to the indices reached via the permutation p starting from index 1, and j will contain the last index accessed. If comps[p[1]] is already 1 initially, the loop won't execute and comps will remain unchanged, with j still equal to 1.`**
