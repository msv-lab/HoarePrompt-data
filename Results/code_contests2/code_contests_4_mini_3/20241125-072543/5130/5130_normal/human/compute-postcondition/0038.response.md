`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `i` has a value of 2, and `col` has a value of 1. Therefore, `comps[2]` is set to 1. Other variables (`n`, `p`, `b`, and `col`) remain unchanged. The output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `p` is a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, `comps` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as `0`, `comps[2]` is 1, and `col` is 1**
