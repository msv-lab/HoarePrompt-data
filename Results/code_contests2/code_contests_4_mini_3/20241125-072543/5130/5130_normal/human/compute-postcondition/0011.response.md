The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. Given that `j` is currently `p[0]`, which is an integer between `0` and `n-1`, the operation updates `comps[p[0]]` to `1` (since `col` is `1`). 

Since `comps` initially has `1` at index `0` and `0` elsewhere, if `p[0]` is `0`, `comps` remains unchanged. However, if `p[0]` is any other index, that index in `comps` will be updated to `1`.

Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `p[0]`:

- If `p[0]` is `0`: `comps` stays the same.
- If `p[0]` is any other index (from `1` to `n-1`): `comps[p[0]]` is set to `1`.

However, since the specific value of `p[0]` is not provided, we can only express the general impact on `comps`.

Output State: **`comps` is updated at index `p[0]` to 1, with `comps[0]` remaining 1, and other indices either remaining 0 or being updated to 1 based on `p[0]`.**
