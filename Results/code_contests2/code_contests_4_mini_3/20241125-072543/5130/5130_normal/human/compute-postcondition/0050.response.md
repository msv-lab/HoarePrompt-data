Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `p` is a permutation of values from 0 to n-1, `b` is a map object containing integers from input, and `comps` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as `0`. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is set to `col`, and `comps[j]` will be set to `col` for all `j` reachable through the permutation `p` until a non-zero entry is encountered in `comps`. If `comps[i]` is already non-zero at the start, the values in `comps` remain unchanged except for `comps[2]` which will be set to 1 if it was originally 0. All previously visited indices in the loop will still reflect their initial state in `comps`, which are 0 unless they have been modified during the execution.***
