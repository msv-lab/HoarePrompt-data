The provided code snippet only defines a function `func_1(ch)` that checks if a character is a consonant. This is just a small part of what would be needed to solve the entire problem, which requires identifying typos in a word based on the specific definition of consecutive consonants.

The problem requires a comprehensive solution that analyzes the whole word to determine if there are any typos (i.e., three or more consecutive consonants with at least two different letters). The current code does not implement any logic to check for typos in the input word, nor does it include any functionality to split the word into parts without typos.

Given that the code is incomplete and does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, we can determine that it does not work as expected. 

A potential input case that would lead to a failure is "hellno", which should be split into "hell no". However, the provided code does not handle this scenario at all.

Correctness: **False**
