The function `func_1` accepts a character parameter `ch`. It checks if `ch` is not a vowel by determining if it is not present in the string 'aeiou'. If `ch` is not a vowel, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This functionality means it effectively identifies consonants and returns `True` for them, while returning `False` for vowels. However, the function does not handle uppercase vowels or other characters (such as digits or punctuation), which could lead to unexpected results if such inputs are provided. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a character `ch` and returns `True` if `ch` is not a lowercase vowel (i.e., it is a consonant or not a vowel), and `False` if `ch` is a lowercase vowel. It does not account for uppercase vowels or other types of characters. **
