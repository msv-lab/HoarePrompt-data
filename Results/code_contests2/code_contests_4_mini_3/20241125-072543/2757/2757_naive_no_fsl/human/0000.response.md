To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we must analyze how it processes the input word according to the problem description.

The main requirement is to identify blocks of three or more consonants that do not consist of the same letter and separate them with spaces. The program accomplishes this with the following logic:

1. It defines a function `func_1` that checks if a character is a consonant.
2. It iterates through the input string, checking for blocks of three consonants.
3. If it finds such a block, it checks if the consonants are not all the same. If they are not the same, it writes the first two consonants followed by a space.
4. If there are not three consonants in a row or they are all the same, it continues writing characters without adding spaces.

However, there are issues in the implementation:

- The program only considers the first three consonants found, which can lead to incorrect behavior in cases where the word contains multiple blocks of consonants. For example:
  - Input: `"hellonnoo"` (Contains "llonn" which has "lon" as a block of three consonants, and it is not handled correctly).
- The program does not correctly separate all identified typos if they occur after the initial detection. For example, if there is a sequence of consonants that is valid after a separation, the program does not correctly handle that, leading to missed cases.

### Example of failure:
For the input `"hellonnoo"`, the expected output should be `"hell on noo"`, as "lon" has three different consonants. However, the program as written will not separate "lon" correctly.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the identified failure case, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
