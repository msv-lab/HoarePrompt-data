Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. There are issues with the logic that lead to incorrect outputs.

One critical flaw is in the handling of the `nums` list, particularly when checking the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2`. The way the program is structured, it will break out of the loop and set `flag` to `False` when it finds any adjacent elements that differ in height by 2 or more, but it does not correctly take into account the scenario where the tallest stack is removed and leads to a potential change in stack heights.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1 3
```
In this case, the algorithm would first remove the '3' stack, which leads to the output being `2` because the heights `2` and `1` do not differ by 2 or more. However, the correct sorted output should be `[1, 2, 3]`.

Moreover, the program is using `raw_input()` and `xrange()`, which are not valid in Python 3. The correct function should be `input()` and `range()` instead.

Therefore, the program fails to handle certain edge cases and does not implement the logic as described, resulting in a determination of **False** for correctness.
