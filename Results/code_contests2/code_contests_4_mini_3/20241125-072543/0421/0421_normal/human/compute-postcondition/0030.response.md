The variable `flag` is explicitly set to `False`. The previous value of `flag` was determined based on the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]`, which could have been either `True` or `False` depending on that difference. However, after the assignment, `flag` is now definitively `False`. The other variables `nums` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is `len(nums) - 1**
