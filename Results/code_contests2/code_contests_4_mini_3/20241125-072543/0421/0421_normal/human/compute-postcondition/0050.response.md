According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to the length of `nums`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and since `nums` contains at least 3 elements, `len(nums)` is at least 3, making `len(nums) - 1` at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted since `flag` and the contents of `nums` do not affect whether the loop can execute again. The only required change is to update `i`.

State: **`nums` contains at least 3 elements, `i` is 3**
