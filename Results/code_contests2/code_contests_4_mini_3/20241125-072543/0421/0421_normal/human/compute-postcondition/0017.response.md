Output State: **`flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of consecutive integers in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2. If `n` is an empty string or `nums` has fewer than 2 integers, the loop does not execute, and `flag` remains True. If `nums` has exactly 1 integer, the loop also does not execute, and `flag` remains True.**
