According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop iterates from `i` starting at 0 up to `len(nums) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `nums` contains at least 2 elements, allowing the loop to execute a second time. 

For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The condition for continuing the loop is that `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. Since `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `len(nums) - 1` will be at least 1.

No other states need to be adjusted based on the provided information. 

State: **`flag` is True if the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` is less than 2; otherwise, `flag` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1.**
