According to the code, the loop execution depends on the length of the `nums` list. The loop will run if `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1, which means `len(nums)` must be at least 2. Since `nums` contains at least one element, it needs to be adjusted to ensure it has at least 2 elements for the loop to execute. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`flag` is True, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
