The value of `flag` is assigned to `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables (`nums` and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is now False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`flag` is now False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0**
