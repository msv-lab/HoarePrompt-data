According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of consecutive integers in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, `flag` remains True. 

Since `flag` is currently False, it must be adjusted to True for the loop to execute again. Additionally, `nums` must not be empty, but we know from the context that `nums` has at least 2 integers and the maximum integer has been removed, so it still contains elements.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `flag` becomes True while keeping `nums` as it is (as long as it still has elements).

State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is not empty**
