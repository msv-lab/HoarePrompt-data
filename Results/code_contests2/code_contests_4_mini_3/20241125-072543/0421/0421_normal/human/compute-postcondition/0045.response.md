Postcondition: ***If the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains True, and the program continues execution without any changes to `flag`. Additionally, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1 throughout this process.***
