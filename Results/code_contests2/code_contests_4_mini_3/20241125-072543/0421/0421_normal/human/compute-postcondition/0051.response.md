Output State: **If `nums` contains at least 2 elements, then `flag` is True if the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in `nums` are less than 2; otherwise, `flag` is set to False upon detecting the first such pair with a difference of 2 or more. If `nums` contains less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and `flag` remains True. In cases where the loop runs, `i` will take values from 0 up to `len(nums) - 2`.**
