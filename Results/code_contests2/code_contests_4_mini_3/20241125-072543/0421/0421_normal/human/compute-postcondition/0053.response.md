According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will continue executing as long as `flag` is true and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has one less element, meaning it still contains elements, and `flag` remains unchanged.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must be true and `nums` must not be empty.

Since `flag` is unchanged and `nums` has one less element but still contains elements, no adjustments are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute again.

State: **`nums` has one less element and `flag` remains unchanged**
