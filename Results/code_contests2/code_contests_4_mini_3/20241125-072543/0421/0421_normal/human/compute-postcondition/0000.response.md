The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input as a string. Since `n` is initially defined as a positive integer representing the size of the array, its previous value is overwritten with the input string. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an input string**
