The initial state defines `flag` based on the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]`. However, the code snippet sets `flag` to `False` directly. Since we don't know the values of `nums[1]` and `nums[2]`, but we know that `flag` is originally determined by their difference, now the value of `flag` is explicitly set to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state includes the current state of `flag`, `nums`, and `i`.

Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
