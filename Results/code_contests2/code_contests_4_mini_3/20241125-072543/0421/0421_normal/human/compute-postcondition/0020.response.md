According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. Since `nums` is not empty, we can determine that it has at least one element. The expression `len(nums) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute. This means that `len(nums)` must be at least 1. 

If `len(nums)` is 1, then `i` will iterate from 0 to `-1`, which means the loop will not execute. For the loop to execute, `len(nums)` needs to be at least 2, which means `nums` must have at least 2 elements.

In summary, for the loop to execute:
1. `nums` must have at least 2 elements.
2. `i` will start at 0.

State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
