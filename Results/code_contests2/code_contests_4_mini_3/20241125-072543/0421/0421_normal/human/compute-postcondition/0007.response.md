Postcondition: ***`n` is a string containing at least one number, `flag` is set to False if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, indicating a significant gap between these two integers. If this condition is not met, `flag` remains True, and the program continues execution without alteration to `flag`.***
