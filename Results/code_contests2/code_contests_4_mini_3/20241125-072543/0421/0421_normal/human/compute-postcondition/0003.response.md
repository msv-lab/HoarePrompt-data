According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. The expression `len(nums) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute, which means that `len(nums)` must be at least 1. Hence, the input string `n` must contain at least one number when split by spaces. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` will be equal to `len(nums) - 2`, and before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0. Therefore, the adjusted states should reflect that `n` is a string containing at least one number, `nums` is a map object of integers derived from `n`, and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a string containing at least one number, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object of integers from `n`, `i` is 0**
