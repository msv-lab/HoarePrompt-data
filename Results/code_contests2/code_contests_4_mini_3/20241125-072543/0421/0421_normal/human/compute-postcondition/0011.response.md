Postcondition: ***`n` is a string containing at least one number, `flag` is set to False as the absolute difference between `nums[len(nums) - 2]` and `nums[len(nums) - 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, indicating a significant gap between these two integers. If this condition is not met, `flag` remains True, and the program continues execution without alteration to `flag`, while `i` is `len(nums) - 1`.***
