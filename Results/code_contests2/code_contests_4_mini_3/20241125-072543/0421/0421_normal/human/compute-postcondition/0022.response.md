The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables `nums` and `i` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
