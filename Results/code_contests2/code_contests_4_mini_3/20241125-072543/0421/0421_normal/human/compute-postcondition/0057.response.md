Functionality: ** The function accepts a sequence of integers input by the user and checks for the presence of at least one pair of consecutive integers with an absolute difference of 2 or more. It removes the maximum integer from the list in each iteration until either a pair is found or there are fewer than 2 integers left. Finally, it prints 'YES' if all consecutive integers have an absolute difference less than 2, and 'NO' if at least one such pair is found. The function does not accept any parameters directly and relies on user input for its operation. It also does not handle cases where the input may not be valid integers. **
