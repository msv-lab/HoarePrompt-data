The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it operates on an internally defined array of size `n`, which is a positive integer. The constraints specify that `n` can range from 1 to 10, and the array consists of `n` space-separated integers, each of which ranges from 1 to 100. Based on these inputs, the function produces an output based on the values in the array. However, since the output details are not provided, I cannot specify the exact return value.

Functionality: **The function operates on an internally defined array of size n, where n is a positive integer between 1 and 10, and the array consists of integers ranging from 1 to 100. The specific output behavior is not detailed.**
