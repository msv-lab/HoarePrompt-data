According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `len(nums) - 1`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be such that it is less than `len(nums) - 1` for the loop to execute again. Given that `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `len(nums)` is at least 3, which means `len(nums) - 1` is at least 2. Therefore, `i` must be less than 2 for the loop to run one more time.

If we assume `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration (the maximum it could be while still allowing the loop to execute again), then `i` needs to be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration to allow the loop to run again.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be incremented to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the list `nums` remains the same and `flag` is not relevant for the continuation of the loop.

State: **`nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
