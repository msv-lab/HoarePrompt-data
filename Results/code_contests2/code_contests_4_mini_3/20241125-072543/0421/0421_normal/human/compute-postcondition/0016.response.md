To determine the necessary adjustments for the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop is structured to iterate `i` from `0` to `len(nums) - 2`. The current value of `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, which is the last valid index for the loop.

2. **State Before the Loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`. This means that the loop has completed its last iteration for the current value of `i`.

3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to increase. In the next iteration, `i` would be `len(nums) - 1`. However, this would be the last iteration, as `i` cannot exceed `len(nums) - 1`.

4. **Condition Checks**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, but since `i` is currently `len(nums) - 2`, the loop can execute once more with `i` becoming `len(nums) - 1`. 

5. **Flag and Other States**: The `flag` does not change unless the absolute difference condition is met. The current state indicates that `flag` is `False`, and there are no changes to it unless specified by the loop body, which is omitted. The condition in the loop body concerning `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` will only affect the continuation of the loop but does not need to be adjusted since we are only concerned with the loop's ability to execute an additional iteration.

6. **Final Adjustments**: Since `i` is currently `len(nums) - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to reflect that in the state. Specifically, `i` should be updated to `len(nums) - 1` and `nums[i]` should be the last element in the list.

Thus, the adjusted state would be:
State: **`n` is a string containing at least one number, `flag` is False, `len(nums)` is at least 3, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`**
