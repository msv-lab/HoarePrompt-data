To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop operates. The loop will continue executing as long as both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty.

1. **Condition on `flag`:** The statement mentions that `flag` remains True or False based on the initial state of `nums`. To allow the loop to execute again, `flag` must be True.

2. **Condition on `nums`:** The loop also checks if `nums` is not empty. Since the maximum element has been removed from `nums`, it is important to know how many elements were in `nums` initially to determine if it can still hold any elements after the removal. If `nums` had at least one element initially, then after removing the maximum, `nums` still contains elements. 

- If we assume `nums` originally had at least two elements, then after removing the maximum element, `nums` will still be non-empty.

Given these points, we can summarize the necessary adjustments:

- We need to ensure that `flag` remains True.
- We need to ensure that `nums` is not empty by confirming it originally had at least two elements.

Therefore, the state modifications required for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`flag` is True and nums contains at least one element**
