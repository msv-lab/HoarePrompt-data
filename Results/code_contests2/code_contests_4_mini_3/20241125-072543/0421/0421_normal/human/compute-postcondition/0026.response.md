The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value of `True`. The states of the other variables (`nums` and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1**
