Postcondition: ***`n` is a string containing at least one number, `flag` is False, `len(nums)` is at least 3, and `i` is `len(nums) - 2`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop or if statement is exited; otherwise, the execution continues without any change to `flag`.***
