Postcondition: ***`nums` contains at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is less than 2, `flag` remains unchanged, and the program continues execution.***
