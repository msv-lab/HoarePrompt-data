Postcondition: ***`flag` is True initially, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains True and no changes occur to `flag`.***
