Output State: **`if nums contains at least 2 integers and there exists at least one pair of consecutive integers in nums with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2, then flag` is False and the maximum integer is removed from nums. If all pairs of consecutive integers have an absolute difference less than 2, flag remains True and the maximum integer is removed from nums. If nums has fewer than 2 integers, the loop does not execute and flag remains True, while nums remains unchanged.**
