The function accepts a list of integers and checks if all adjacent elements in the list have an absolute difference of less than 2. If such a difference is found, it sets a flag to False and stops checking. It then removes the maximum element from the list until either the flag is False or there are no more elements to check. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the flag remains True after processing, indicating that all adjacent elements met the condition, or 'NO' if the flag became False. The function does not explicitly check or enforce any constraints on the input size or values.
