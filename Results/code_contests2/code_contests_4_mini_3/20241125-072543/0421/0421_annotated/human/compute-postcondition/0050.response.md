According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the `nums` list. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `nums` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.

Since `nums` has at least 2 elements, we need to ensure that `len(nums)` is greater than 3 to allow `i` to be 3 and for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `len(nums)` must be at least 4.

State: **`nums` has at least 4 elements, `i` is 3**
