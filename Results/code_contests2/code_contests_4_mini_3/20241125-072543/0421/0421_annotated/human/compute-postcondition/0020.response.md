According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. The loop will execute if `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1, which means `len(nums)` must be at least 2. Since the state indicates that `nums` has at least 1 element, we need to adjust this to ensure that it has at least 2 elements for the loop to execute at least once. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`flag` is True, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
