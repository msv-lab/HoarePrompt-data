To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions based on the provided state.

1. The loop condition is `flag and nums`. This means that for the loop to execute, `flag` must be `True` and `nums` must not be empty.
2. The variable `flag` is `True` if all adjacent elements in `nums` have an absolute difference of less than 2. It becomes `False` if at least one adjacent pair has an absolute difference of greater than or equal to 2.
3. The state of `nums` has been modified by removing the maximum value from it. We do not know the exact content of `nums`, but we know that it must contain at least one element for the loop to execute again.

Given these points, if `flag` is currently `True`, and `nums` has at least one element, the loop can execute again without needing adjustments. 

However, if `flag` is `False`, the loop cannot execute again since the loop condition is not satisfied. If `nums` is not empty, we need to ensure that it still satisfies the conditions of `flag` being `True`.

Since the prompt does not provide information about whether `flag` is currently `True` or `False`, we cannot make assumptions about its state. 

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to maintain `flag` as `True` and ensure that `nums` remains non-empty.

State: **`flag` is True and nums is not empty**
