The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer that must be between 1 and 10 (inclusive). `nums` is a list of integers where each integer satisfies the condition that it is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on them, although the specific output behavior is not described in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `nums`, and then return a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a list of integers nums (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each ai in nums).**
