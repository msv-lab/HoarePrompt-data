The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `nums`, or `i`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for those variables.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `flag` is False**
