The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value of `True`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is False, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2**
