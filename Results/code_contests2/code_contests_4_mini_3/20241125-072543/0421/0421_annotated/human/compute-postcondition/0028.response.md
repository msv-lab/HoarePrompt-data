Postcondition: ***`flag` is True and `nums` contains at least 2 elements. If the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains True.***
