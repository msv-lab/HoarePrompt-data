The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
