The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous state of `flag` was `True`, so after this assignment, `flag` changes from `True` to `False`. The values of `nums` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and index `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and index `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2.**
