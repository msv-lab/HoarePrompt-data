The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables `n`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `flag` is False.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `flag` is False**
