Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing without breaking out.***
