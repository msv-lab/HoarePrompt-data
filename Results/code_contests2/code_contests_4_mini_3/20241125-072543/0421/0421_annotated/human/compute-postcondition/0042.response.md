According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are remaining pairs of elements in the `nums` list to compare. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = len(nums) - 2`, which means that the last valid index for `i` is `len(nums) - 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `nums` has at least 2 elements, but the specific value of `i` is not provided. To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 2`. 

If `nums` has at least 2 elements, we can deduce that `i` must be at least 0. Therefore, for the next iteration of the loop to occur, we need to adjust `i` to 1, which would allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `flag` remains True unless the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, in which case `flag` becomes False and we break out of the most internal loop.**
