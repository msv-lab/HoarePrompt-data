The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `flag` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
