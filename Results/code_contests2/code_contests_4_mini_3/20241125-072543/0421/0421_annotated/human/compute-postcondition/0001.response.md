The value of `flag` is assigned to `True`, and it is the only variable affected by this line of code. The previous values of `n` (a string representation of a positive integer) and `nums` (a list of integers) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `nums` is a list of integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100, and `flag` is True.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `nums` is a list of integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100, and `flag` is True**
