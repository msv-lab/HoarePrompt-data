Postcondition: ***`flag` is True initially, and if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the current loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains True. Additionally, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0.***
