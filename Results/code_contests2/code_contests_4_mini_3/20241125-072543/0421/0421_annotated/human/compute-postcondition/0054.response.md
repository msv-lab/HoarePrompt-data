Output State: **If `nums` has at least 2 elements and all adjacent elements have an absolute difference of less than 2, then `flag` remains True, and the maximum element is removed from `nums`. If any adjacent elements have an absolute difference of 2 or more, then `flag` becomes False, and the loop stops. If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements at the start, the loop does not execute, `flag` remains True, and `nums` is unchanged. The final state of `nums` is modified to remove the maximum value up to the point where the loop ended, but the exact elements left in `nums` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values in the list.**
