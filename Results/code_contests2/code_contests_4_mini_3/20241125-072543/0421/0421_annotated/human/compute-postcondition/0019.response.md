According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop can execute again if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, if `nums` had at least 2 elements, the maximum element was removed from `nums`, and `flag` remains unchanged. If `nums` had fewer than 2 elements, `flag` remains True and `nums` is unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must still be True, and `nums` must have at least one element remaining. Since we do not know the exact status of `nums` from the previous state except that it has fewer than 2 elements (if that was the case), we cannot ensure that the loop will execute again without further adjustments.

Thus, we need to ensure that `nums` contains at least one element while `flag` remains True.

State: **`flag` is True and `nums` has at least 1 element**
