According to the code, the loop will iterate while `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `nums` has at least 2 elements, which means `len(nums)` is at least 2. Therefore, `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1, allowing the loop to execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The condition regarding `flag` does not affect the loop's ability to execute; it only determines the state of `flag`. Since `flag` remains True if the condition is not met, there is no need to adjust its state unless specified otherwise.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1.**
