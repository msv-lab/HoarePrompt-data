Output State: **If `nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` will be True if all adjacent elements in `nums` have an absolute difference of less than 2; if any adjacent elements have an absolute difference of 2 or more, `flag` will be set to False and the loop will terminate early. If `nums` has only 1 element, the loop does not execute, and `flag` remains True.**
