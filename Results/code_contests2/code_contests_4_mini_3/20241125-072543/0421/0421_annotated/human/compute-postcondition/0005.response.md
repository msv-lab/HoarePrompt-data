The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `flag` was `True`. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `flag` while maintaining the previous states of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `flag` is False, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.**
