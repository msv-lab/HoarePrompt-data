Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 2 elements and `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the absolute difference is less than 2, `flag` remains True and there is no change in its state.***
