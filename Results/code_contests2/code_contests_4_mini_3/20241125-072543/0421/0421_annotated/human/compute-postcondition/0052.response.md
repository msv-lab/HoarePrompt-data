Output State: **`flag` is True if all adjacent elements in `nums` have an absolute difference of less than 2; otherwise, `flag` becomes False at the first instance where the absolute difference is greater than or equal to 2. If `nums` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and `flag` remains True. The state of `nums` is modified by removing the maximum value from it, but the exact state of `nums` is unknown.**
