The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input as a string. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), its value will be a string representation of that integer. Other variables remain unaffected, so the output state reflects `n` being updated to its new string value.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `nums` is a list of integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100**
