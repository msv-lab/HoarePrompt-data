Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 2 elements and `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, there is no change to `flag` and the program continues executing the subsequent code outside this if statement.***
