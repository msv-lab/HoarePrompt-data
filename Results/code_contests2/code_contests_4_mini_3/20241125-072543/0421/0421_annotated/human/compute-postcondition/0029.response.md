According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. In the loop, `i` iterates from `0` to `len(nums) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be `len(nums) - 2`, which means it is currently at the second to last element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `len(nums) - 1`, which is the last index (`len(nums) - 1`). 

Since `nums` contains at least 2 elements, the condition for the loop to execute again is met. The only adjustment needed is to update `i` to the next value, which will be `len(nums) - 1`.

State: **`flag` is True and `nums` contains at least 2 elements, i is `len(nums) - 1`**
