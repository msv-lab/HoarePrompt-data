According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. The loop will iterate as long as `len(nums) - 1` is non-negative, which means that `nums` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to start executing. Given that `nums` has at least 2 elements before the loop starts, the index `i` should begin at 0. After the loop execution, `flag` will be affected based on the condition of the adjacent elements.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `i` should be initialized to 0. 

State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `flag` remains True, `i` is 0**
