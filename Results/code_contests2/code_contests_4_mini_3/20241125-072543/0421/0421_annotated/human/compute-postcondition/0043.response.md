The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, which changes its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables, `nums` and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `flag` is now False.

Output State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `flag` is now False**
