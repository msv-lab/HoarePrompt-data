According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `nums` has at least 2 elements, which means `len(nums)` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.

Since we are not modifying `nums` and only need to adjust `i`, no other state variables need to be changed.

State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
