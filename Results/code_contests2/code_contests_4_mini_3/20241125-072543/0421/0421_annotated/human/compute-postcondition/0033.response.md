According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `i` in relation to the length of `nums`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`, which means the loop cannot execute again since the condition `i < len(nums) - 1` is no longer satisfied.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 2`. Since the values of `nums` and `flag` are not affected by this condition, they do not require any adjustments.

State: **`flag` is True, nums contains at least 2 elements, i is equal to len(nums) - 2**
