The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False`. The other variables `nums` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is `len(nums) - 1`. 

Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is `len(nums) - 1**
