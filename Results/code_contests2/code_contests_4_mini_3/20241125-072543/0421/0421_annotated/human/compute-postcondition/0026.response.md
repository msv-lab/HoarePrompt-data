The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The values of `nums` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
