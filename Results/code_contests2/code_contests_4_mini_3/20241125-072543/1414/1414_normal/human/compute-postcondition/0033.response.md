Output State: **If `a` is positive, the loop will execute while `a` is greater than 0, incrementing `res` each time. Depending on the value of `b`, `a` will be decreased by either `k * v`, `(b + 1) * v`, or `v`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b` will decrease by `(k - 1)`. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, `b` will be set to 0. If `b` is 0, `a` will simply decrease by `v`. The loop ends when `a` is no longer positive. If `a` starts at 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains 0.**
