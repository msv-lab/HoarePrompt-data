The value of `b` is decreased by `(k - 1)`. Since `b` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `k`, the result of this operation will still keep `b` non-negative. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `b` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`k` is an integer in the range [2, 1000], `a` is a positive integer decreased by `k * v`, `b` is a non-negative integer decreased by (k - 1), `v` is a positive integer, and `res` is 1**
