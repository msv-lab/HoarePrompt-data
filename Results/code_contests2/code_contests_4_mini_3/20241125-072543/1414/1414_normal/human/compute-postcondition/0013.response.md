Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer in the range [2, 1000], `a` is a positive integer that is decreased based on the value of `b`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is decreased by `k * v` and `b` is decreased by `(k - 1)`. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, `a` is decreased by `v` and `b` remains unchanged. In all cases, `v` is a positive integer and `res` remains 1.***
