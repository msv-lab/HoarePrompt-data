Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer in the range [2, 1000], `a` is updated to a value less than or equal to its previous value depending on the condition of `b`. If `b` is greater than 0, `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, `a` is decreased by `v`. `b` remains unchanged in the else case, and `v` is a positive integer, while `res` is still 1.***
