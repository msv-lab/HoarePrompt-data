The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown, so the output state is: `k` is an integer in the range [2, 1000], `a` remains greater than 0, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer in the range [2, 1000], `a` remains greater than 0, and `res` is increased by 1**
