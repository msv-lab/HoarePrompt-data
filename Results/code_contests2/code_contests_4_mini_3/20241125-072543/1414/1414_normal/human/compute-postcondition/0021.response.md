Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer in the range [2, 1000], `a` is a positive integer that has decreased by either `(b + 1) * v` if `b > 0` or by `v` if `b <= 0`. In both cases, `b` will be 0 if `b > 0`, and `res` is increased by 1. Additionally, `a` remains greater than 0 after this operation, ensuring that the program continues to function correctly in subsequent iterations.***
