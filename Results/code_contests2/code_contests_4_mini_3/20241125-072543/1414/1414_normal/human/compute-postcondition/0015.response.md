The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so we only know that `res` will now be its previous value plus 1. The states of the other variables, `k`, `a`, and `b`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer in the range [2, 1000], `a` is a positive integer that will remain greater than 0 after the next iteration, `b` is such that the next state can be determined, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer in the range [2, 1000], `a` is a positive integer that will remain greater than 0 after the next iteration, `b` is such that the next state can be determined, and `res` is increased by 1**
