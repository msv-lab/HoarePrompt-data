Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer in the range [2, 1000]. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v`, `b` is set to 0, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`, and `res` is still increased by 1. In all cases, `a` remains greater than 0 after execution.***
