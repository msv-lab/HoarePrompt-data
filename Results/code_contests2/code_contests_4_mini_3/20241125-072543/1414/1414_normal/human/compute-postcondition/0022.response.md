Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer in the range [2, 1000]. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v` (remaining positive), and `b` is decreased by `k - 1`, with `res` increased by 1. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v` (remaining positive), `b` is set to 0, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by `v` (remaining positive), and `res` is increased by 1. In all cases, `a` remains greater than 0 after the operation.***
