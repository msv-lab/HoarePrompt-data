`b` is assigned the value of `0`, but the previous value of `b` is not specified. The values of `k`, `a`, and `res` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is an integer in the range [2, 1000], `a` is a positive integer greater than 0, `b` is 0 (newly assigned), and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer in the range [2, 1000], `a` is a positive integer greater than 0, `b` is 0, and `res` is increased by 1**
