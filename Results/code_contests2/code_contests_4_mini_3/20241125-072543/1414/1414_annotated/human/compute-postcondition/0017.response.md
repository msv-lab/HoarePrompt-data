The value of `b` is decremented by `(k - 1)`. Since `b` is non-negative and `k` is at least 2, the new value of `b` will remain non-negative. The other variables `a` and `res` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the change to `b`.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, `res` is 2**
