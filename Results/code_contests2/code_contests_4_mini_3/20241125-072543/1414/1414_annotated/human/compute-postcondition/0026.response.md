The value of `b` is decremented by `(k - 1)`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and 1000. This means `b` is updated based on its previous value minus `(k - 1)`. The states of `a` and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is updated to `a - k * v`; `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`; `res` is 3.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is updated to `a - k * v`; `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`; `res` is 3**
