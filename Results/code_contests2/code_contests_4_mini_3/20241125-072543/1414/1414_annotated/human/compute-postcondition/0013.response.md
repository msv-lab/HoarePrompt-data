Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `k` â‰¤ 1000, `a` is a positive integer, and `b` is a non-negative integer. If `b >= k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v` and `b` is decreased by `k - 1`. If `0 < b < k`, then `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b == 0`, then `a` is decreased by `v`. In all cases, `v` is a positive integer, and `res` remains 1. Additionally, care is taken to ensure that `a` does not become negative after the calculations, considering its initial positive value.***
