The code increments the value of `res` by 1. The previous value of `res` is 1, so after execution, `res` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`k`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `a` is greater than `v`, `b` is non-negative, and `res` is 2.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `a` is greater than `v`, `b` is non-negative, and `res` is 2**
