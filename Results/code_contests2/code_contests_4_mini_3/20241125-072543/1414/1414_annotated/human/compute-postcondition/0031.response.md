Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; if `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v` and `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`; if `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0; if `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is updated to `a - v` and `b` is unchanged; in all cases, `res` remains 3.***
