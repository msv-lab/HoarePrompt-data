Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `a` is updated based on the value of `b`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v` and `b` is decreased by `k - 1`. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by `v` while `b` remains non-negative. In all cases, `res` remains 2. Additionally, `a` remains greater than `v` after the execution.***
