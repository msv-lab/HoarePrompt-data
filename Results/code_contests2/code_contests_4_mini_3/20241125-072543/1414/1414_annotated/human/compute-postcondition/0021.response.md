Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v`, `b` is set to 0, and `a` remains greater than `v`. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`, and `b` remains non-negative. In both cases, `res` is still 2.***
