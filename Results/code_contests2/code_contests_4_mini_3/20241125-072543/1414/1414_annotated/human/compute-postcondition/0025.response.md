The value of `a` is decreased by `k * v`. The value of `k` is between 2 and 1000, and `v` is less than `a`, so after this operation, `a` will be updated to a new value that is less than its original value. The values of `b` and `res` remain unaffected, and `b` is still based on the value of `k`, while `res` is 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is updated to `a - k * v`; `b` is updated based on the value of `k`; `res` is 3.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is updated to `a - k * v`; `b` is updated based on the value of `k`; `res` is 3**
