Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `a` is updated based on the value of `b`: if `b` is greater than 0, `a` becomes `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0; if `b` is 0, then `a` is decreased by `v` while `b` remains 0. In either case, `v` is a positive integer, and `res` remains 1. Additionally, since `a` is a positive integer and `b` is a non-negative integer that is less than `k`, care should be taken to ensure that `a` does not become negative after the calculations.***
