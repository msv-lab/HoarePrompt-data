Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `a` is updated based on the condition of `b`. If `b` > 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`, `b` is set to 0, and `res` remains 3. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is updated to `a - v`, `b` is updated based on the value of `k`, and `res` is still 3.***
