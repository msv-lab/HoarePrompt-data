To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and see if it meets the requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The ticket number must be a lucky number, meaning it can only contain the digits 4 and 7.
2. The length of the ticket number is even.
3. The sum of the first half of the digits must equal the sum of the second half of the digits.

### Code Analysis:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    digits = map(int, raw_input().strip())
    if sum(digits[:n / 2]) == sum(digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Issues Identified:
1. **Lucky Number Check**: The program does not check if the digits of the ticket number are only 4s or 7s. According to the problem description, a ticket must be a lucky number to be considered lucky. The absence of this check means that tickets containing other digits will still be evaluated for the sum condition, which is incorrect.
   
   For example, if we input:
   ```
   4
   1234
   ```
   The program will output "NO" because the sums do not match, but it should have returned "NO" for being an unlucky number first.

2. **Index Calculation Error**: The program uses `n / 2 + n % 2` to calculate the start of the second half of the digits. This is incorrect because it does not properly divide the number into two equal halves. Instead, it should simply use `n / 2` for both halves as n is guaranteed to be even.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, particularly the lack of a check for lucky digits and the incorrect slicing of the list, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
