Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the required checks for a lucky ticket. Specifically, it fails to verify that the ticket number contains only the digits 4 and 7, which are the defining characteristics of a lucky number. For example, if the input is:

```
4
4738
```
The program would incorrectly print "NO" because the sums of the halves are not equal, but it does not check if the ticket number is lucky in the first place (i.e., it should contain only the digits 4 and 7). 

Additionally, the program has an indexing error in the slicing of the digits for the second half: `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]` should instead be `digits[n // 2:]` to correctly capture the second half of the digits.

Thus, there are multiple issues that prevent the program from being correct as per the problem description.
