Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer within the range of 2 to 50, and `digits` is a map object of integers. If the sum of the first half of the elements in `digits` (up to `n / 2`) is equal to the sum of the second half (from `n / 2 + n % 2` to `n`), the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.***
