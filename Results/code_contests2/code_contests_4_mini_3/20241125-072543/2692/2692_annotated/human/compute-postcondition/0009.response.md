The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it operates with two key constraints: `n`, which is an even integer within the range of 2 to 50, and a `ticket number`, which is a positive integer represented as a string consisting of exactly `n` digits that can only be the characters '4' and '7'.

Based on the output behavior described, the function likely performs checks or computations based on these constraints. However, since the output is not specified in detail, we cannot outline specific return cases.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate on an even integer `n` (ranging from 2 to 50) and a ticket number (a string of `n` digits made up of '4' and '7'), returning some value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a ticket number (a string of exactly n digits containing only '4' and '7').**
