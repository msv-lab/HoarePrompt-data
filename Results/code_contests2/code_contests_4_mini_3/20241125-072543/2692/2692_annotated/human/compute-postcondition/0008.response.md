Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer within the range of 2 to 50, and `digits` is a list of integers derived from a positive integer ticket number represented as a string of exactly `n` digits containing only '4' and '7'. If the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This covers all cases including when `n` is 2 (the smallest even integer) and when `n` is 50 (the largest even integer), ensuring that the sums are compared correctly for all valid configurations of `digits`.***
