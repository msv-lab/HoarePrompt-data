The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a sequence of `n` digits (which must be entered as a string of integers containing only '4' and '7'). It checks if the sum of the first half of `digits` is equal to the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input is not an even integer or where the digits do not meet the specified criteria, which could lead to potential errors or unexpected behavior.
