The provided program is intended to determine if a ticket number is a "lucky" ticket based on the criteria specified in the problem description. However, upon reviewing the code, it seems to have several issues that lead to incorrect results.

1. **Lucky Number Definition**: The program does not check if all digits in the ticket number are either '4' or '7'. The problem states that a lucky ticket must only consist of these lucky digits, but the program does not enforce this condition.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The current implementation calculates the sum of the first half and the sum of the second half incorrectly. The slice for the second half should be `digits[n / 2:]`, not `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]`. The latter would skip one digit in the second half when `n` is even, resulting in incorrect sum comparisons.

3. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.

4. **Edge Cases**: Since the program does not validate if the digits are only '4' or '7', it fails to handle cases where the ticket number contains other digits, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Example of Failure
For the input:
```
4
1234
```
The expected output is "NO" because the ticket number is not a lucky number (it contains digits other than 4 and 7). However, the program would incorrectly output "YES" since it would calculate the sums as 1 (from the first half) and 3 (from the second half), which are not equal. 

### Conclusion
Due to the above reasons, particularly the failure to check for lucky digits and the incorrect slicing for sum calculations, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
