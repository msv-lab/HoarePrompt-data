You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Petya loves tickets very much. As we know, each ticket has a number that is a positive integer. Its length equals n (n is always even). Petya calls a ticket lucky if the ticket's number is a lucky number and the sum of digits in the first half (the sum of the first n / 2 digits) equals the sum of digits in the second half (the sum of the last n / 2 digits). Check if the given ticket is lucky.

Input

The first line contains an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the length of the ticket number that needs to be checked. The second line contains an integer whose length equals exactly n — the ticket number. The number may contain leading zeros.

Output

On the first line print "YES" if the given ticket number is lucky. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

2
47


Output

NO


Input

4
4738


Output

NO


Input

4
4774


Output

YES

Note

In the first sample the sum of digits in the first half does not equal the sum of digits in the second half (4 ≠ 7).

In the second sample the ticket number is not the lucky number.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        n = int(raw_input().strip())
        digits = map(int, raw_input().strip())
        if (sum(digits[:n / 2]) == sum(digits[n / 2 + n % 2:])) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer within the range of 2 to 50, and `digits` is a map object of integers. If the sum of the first half of the elements in `digits` (up to `n / 2`) is equal to the sum of the second half (from `n / 2 + n % 2` to `n`), the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer within the range of 2 to 50, and `digits` is a list of integers derived from a positive integer ticket number represented as a string of exactly `n` digits containing only '4' and '7'. If the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This covers all cases including when `n` is 2 (the smallest even integer) and when `n` is 50 (the largest even integer), ensuring that the sums are compared correctly for all valid configurations of `digits`.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
