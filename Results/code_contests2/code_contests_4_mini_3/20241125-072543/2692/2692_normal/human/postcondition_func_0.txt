The function reads an integer `n` and a list of integers from input, then checks if the sum of the first half of the list equals the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. It assumes that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 50, but does not handle input errors or cases where `n` is not even or out of bounds.
