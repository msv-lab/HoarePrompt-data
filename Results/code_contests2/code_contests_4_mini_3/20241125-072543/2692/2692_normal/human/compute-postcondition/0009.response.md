The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), and `ticket_number`, which is a positive integer represented as a string of exactly `n` digits containing only the digits 4 and 7. After executing the function body, the output is determined by the following cases:

Case_1: If `ticket_number` contains exactly half of the digits as 4s and half as 7s, the function returns "YES";  
Case_2: If `ticket_number` does not meet the criteria of Case_1, the function returns "NO".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an even integer `n` and a string `ticket_number`, and to return "YES" if the ticket number is balanced with equal counts of 4s and 7s; otherwise, it returns "NO". 

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer `n` and a string `ticket_number`, returns "YES" if `ticket_number` has an equal number of 4s and 7s; otherwise, it returns "NO".**
