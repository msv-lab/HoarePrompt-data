Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `digits` is a list of integers derived from a string of exactly `n` digits containing only the digits 4 and 7. If the sum of the first half of `digits` is equal to the sum of the second half, 'YES' is printed, indicating that both halves are balanced. If `n` is 2, the program checks if the two single digits are equal. For larger even values of `n`, the program compares the sums of the respective halves of the `digits` array, printing 'NO' if they are not equal.***
