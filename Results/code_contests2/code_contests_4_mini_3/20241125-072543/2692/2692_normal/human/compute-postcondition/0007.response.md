Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 50, and `digits` is a map object containing integers. If the sum of the first half of `digits` is equal to the sum of the second half, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. In the case where `n` is 2, both halves consist of a single element, and the program checks if these two elements are equal. For larger even values of `n`, the program compares the sums of the respective halves of the `digits` array.***
