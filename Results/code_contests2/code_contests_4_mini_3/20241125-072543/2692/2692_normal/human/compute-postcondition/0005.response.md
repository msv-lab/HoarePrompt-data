Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer that is even and between 2 and 50. The sum of the first half of the elements in `digits` (from index 0 to n/2 - 1) is not equal to the sum of the second half of the elements in `digits` (from index n/2 + n % 2 to n - 1). `digits` is a map object containing integers derived from the input.***
