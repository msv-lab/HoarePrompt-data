Functionality: ** The function accepts four parameters representing the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) of two points in a 2D space and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points. It does not handle any edge cases, such as checking if the inputs are valid numbers or managing potential overflow issues in calculations. **
