The function `func_1` accepts parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. All four parameters are integers representing the coordinates of two different cities in a 2D space. After executing the function body, it returns the distance between the two cities located at the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the coordinates of two cities and return the distance between them. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2, representing the coordinates of two cities, and returns the distance between these two cities.**
