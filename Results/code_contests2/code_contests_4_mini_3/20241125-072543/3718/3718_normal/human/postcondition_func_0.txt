The function accepts four parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, which represent the coordinates of two points in a 2D space. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points. The function does not handle cases where the input values are not numerical or where the square root operation might lead to errors, but it is assumed that the input values are valid for this calculation.
