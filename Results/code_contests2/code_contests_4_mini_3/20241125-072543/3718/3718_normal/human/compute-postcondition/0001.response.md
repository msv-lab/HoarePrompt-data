The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. All these parameters are integers representing the coordinates of two distinct cities. The function calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities represented by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept the coordinates of two cities and return the Euclidean distance between them.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2 representing the coordinates of two distinct cities, and returns the Euclidean distance between them.**
