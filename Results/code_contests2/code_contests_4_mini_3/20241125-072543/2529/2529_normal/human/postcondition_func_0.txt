The function accepts no parameters, prompts the user for a positive integer `m` (between 1 and 200,000), and reads `m` float inputs. It counts the occurrences of each float in the input list and prints these counts as a space-separated string. If `m` is less than 1 or greater than 200,000, the function will not execute the input loop, resulting in no output. Additionally, since it uses `test_list.count(i)` within a loop, the time complexity may be inefficient for larger values of `m` due to repeated counting of the same elements.
