The code appends the value of `e` to the `test_list`. The initial state indicates that `test_list` is empty, so after executing the code, `test_list` will contain one element, which is the float value `e`. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000, `i` is 0, `test_list` contains the float `e`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000, `i` is 0, `test_list` contains the float `e`**
