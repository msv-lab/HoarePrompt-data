The code initializes `test_list` as an empty list. The previous value of `m` is unchanged and remains a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000; `test_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000; `test_list` is an empty list**
