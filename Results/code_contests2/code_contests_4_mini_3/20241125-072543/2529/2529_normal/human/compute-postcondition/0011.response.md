According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 3 (since `i` will be incremented to 3), and `i` should be updated to 3 to reflect the next iteration. 

State: **`m` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `e` is a float input, and `e` is appended to `test_list`**
