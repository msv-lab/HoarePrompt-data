The code `test_list.append(e)` adds the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The variable `m` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation, and `i` also remains unchanged since it is not involved in the operation. The variable `e` retains its float value as well. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `e` to `test_list` without altering the other variables.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000, `i` is 1, `e` is a float input, and `e` is appended to `test_list`**
