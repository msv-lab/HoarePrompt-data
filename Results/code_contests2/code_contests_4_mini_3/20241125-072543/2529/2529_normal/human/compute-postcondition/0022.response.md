The `print` statement outputs a string that is created by joining the string representations of the elements in `my_list` with spaces. If `my_list` is empty, nothing will be printed. If `my_list` contains elements, those elements will be printed as a space-separated string. 

The initial state indicates that `my_list` contains counts of occurrences of each element in `test_list`. Therefore, the output state will depend on whether `my_list` is empty or has entries.

Output State: **`my_list` is either empty or contains counts of occurrences from `test_list` and the printed output is a space-separated string of those counts.**
