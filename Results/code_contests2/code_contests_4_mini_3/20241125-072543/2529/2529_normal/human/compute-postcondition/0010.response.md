The code `test_list.append(e)` appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The variable `m` is greater than 1, and `i` is 2, but these variables are not affected by this operation. The state of `test_list` changes as `e` is added to it. 

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `e` is a float input, and `e` is appended to `test_list`**
