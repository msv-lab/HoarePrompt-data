The function `func` accepts no parameters. It processes positive integer `m`, which must satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000. Additionally, the function handles coordinates that are valid arithmetic expressions formatted as (a+b)/c, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers with up to two decimal digits. After executing the function body, it returns a result based on the given constraints and calculations involving these coordinates.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a positive integer m within the range 1 to 200,000 and evaluates valid arithmetic expressions for coordinates in the form of (a+b)/c, returning a result based on these inputs.**
