The value of `m` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a positive integer input from the user. The previous constraints indicate that `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000. The exact value of `m` is determined by the user input. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000**
