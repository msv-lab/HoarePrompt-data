According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. For the loop to execute, `test_list` must contain at least one element, which is ensured since `m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000. Before the loop starts, `my_list` is empty, and the loop will begin with the first element of `test_list`. Therefore, we need to set `i` to the first element of `test_list`.

State: **`test_list` contains `m` float inputs (where m is a positive integer greater than 0), `my_list` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `test_list`**
