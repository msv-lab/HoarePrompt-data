According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, it will allow the loop to execute as long as it has a valid value. The loop will iterate `m` times, and the variable `i` will take on values from `0` to `m-1`. 

Since `test_list` is empty, it won't affect the execution of the loop itself. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to `0` as that is the first value it will take during the first iteration.

State: **`m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000, `i` is 0, `test_list` is an empty list**
