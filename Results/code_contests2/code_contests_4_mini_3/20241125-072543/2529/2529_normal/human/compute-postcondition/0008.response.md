According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `m`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` should become 2. Additionally, `m` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can run again.

We do not have any specific information about `m`, but since `m` is a positive integer within the range mentioned, we can infer that it could be at least 2.

Therefore, the adjusted states will be:
- `m` is greater than 1 (to allow the next iteration)
- `i` is now 2 (the incremented value)

State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `e` is a float input, and `e` is appended to `test_list`**
