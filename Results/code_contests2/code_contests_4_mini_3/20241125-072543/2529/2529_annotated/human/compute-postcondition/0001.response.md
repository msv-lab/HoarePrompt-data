The code initializes an empty list called `test_list`. The previous value of `m` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `m` and the new initialization of `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000; `test_list` is an empty list**
