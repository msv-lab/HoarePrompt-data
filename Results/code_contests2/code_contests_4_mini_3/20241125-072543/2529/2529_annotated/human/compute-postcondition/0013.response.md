The code initializes an empty list `my_list`. Since `my_list` is assigned an empty list, regardless of the previous values of `test_list`, `i`, and `m`, the state of `my_list` is now empty. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers inputted by the user, `i` is the index of the current iteration, and `my_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers inputted by the user, `i` is the index of the current iteration, `my_list` is an empty list**.
