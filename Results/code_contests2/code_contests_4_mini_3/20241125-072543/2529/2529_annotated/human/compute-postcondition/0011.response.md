According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `m` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 3, so that `i` can be incremented to 3 in the next iteration. 

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`m` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `e` is a floating-point number input, and `e` has been appended to `test_list` again**
