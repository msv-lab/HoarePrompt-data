According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, meaning `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.

Since the loop runs from 0 to m-1, we must ensure that `i` becomes 1, while `m` remains unchanged. Thus, the state needs to be adjusted accordingly. 

State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `e` is a floating-point number input, and `e` has been appended to `test_list`**
