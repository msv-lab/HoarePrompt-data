According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `m` can be any value from 1 to 200,000, it must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing. So, `m` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1.

State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `e` is a floating-point number input, `e` has been appended to `test_list`**
