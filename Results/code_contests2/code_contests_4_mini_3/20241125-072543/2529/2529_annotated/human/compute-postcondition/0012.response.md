The loop reads floating-point numbers from input and appends them to the `test_list`. The loop is designed to execute `m` times, where `m` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 200,000, inclusive. Thus, the loop will always execute at least once for valid input.

Output State: **`test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers inputted by the user, `i` is the index of the current iteration (ranging from 0 to m-1), and `m` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000. If `m` were to be less than 1, the loop would not execute, and `test_list` would remain empty.**
