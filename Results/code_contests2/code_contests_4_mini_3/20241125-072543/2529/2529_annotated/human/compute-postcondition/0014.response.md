According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. If `test_list` contains at least 1 element, the loop can execute. The variable `i` represents the current element from `test_list` in the iteration. Since `my_list` is empty, it does not impact the execution of the loop. For the loop to be executed, `test_list` must contain at least 1 floating-point number, and `i` should be the first element in `test_list` during the first iteration.

State: **`test_list` contains at least 1 floating-point number, `i` is the first element in `test_list`, `my_list` is an empty list**
