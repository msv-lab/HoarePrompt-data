The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The constraints indicate that `m` is an integer ranging from 1 to 200,000, and that each jump coordinate is represented by an arithmetic expression of the form (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers with up to two decimal digits. 

However, since the function does not take any input parameters explicitly, we cannot attribute specific input values to parameters in the function signature. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value of the function based on the information given.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and the return value is unspecified based on the provided information.**
