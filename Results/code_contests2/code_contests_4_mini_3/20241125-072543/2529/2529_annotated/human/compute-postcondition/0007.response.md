The code appends the value of `e` to `test_list`. The previous values of `m`, `i`, and `e` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `e` to `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `e` is a floating-point number input, and `e` has been appended to `test_list**
