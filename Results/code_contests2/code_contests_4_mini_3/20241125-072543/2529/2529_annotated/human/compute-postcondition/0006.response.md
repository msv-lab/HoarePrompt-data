The value of `e` is assigned the value `float(input())`, where `input` accepts a floating-point number and `float` converts it to a float. The variable `m` remains unchanged, and `i` is still 1. The list `test_list` remains unaffected as well.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ m â‰¤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `e` is a floating-point number input, and `e` has been appended to `test_list**
