The code appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The variable `m` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, and `e` retains its input value. The output state reflects the update to `test_list` without altering the other variables.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ m â‰¤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `e` is a floating-point number input, and `e` has been appended to `test_list`.**
