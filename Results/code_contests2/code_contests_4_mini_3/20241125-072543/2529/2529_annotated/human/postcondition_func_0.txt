The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `m` from user input, which determines the number of floating-point numbers to be entered next. It then collects `m` floating-point numbers into a list called `test_list`. After that, it calculates the count of each unique number in `test_list` and appends these counts to another list called `my_list`. Finally, it prints the counts as a space-separated string. If `m` is less than 1, the function does not execute the input loop, resulting in an empty `my_list` and printing nothing. Additionally, the counting of elements is inefficient, as it uses `.count()` within a loop, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case.
