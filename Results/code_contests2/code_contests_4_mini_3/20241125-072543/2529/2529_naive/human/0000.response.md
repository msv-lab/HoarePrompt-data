To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to calculate how many ships will end up at the same coordinate after jumping, where the coordinate is given by an arithmetic expression of the form (a+b)/c.

### Program Breakdown
The program is structured as follows:
1. It reads an integer `m`, which represents the number of ships.
2. It initializes an empty list `test_list` to store the calculated coordinates.
3. It then reads `m` expressions representing the jump coordinates, but it mistakenly inputs them as floats directly, not evaluating the expressions correctly.
4. It counts the occurrence of each coordinate in `test_list` and stores those counts in `my_list`.
5. Finally, it prints the counts.

### Key Issues
1. **Input Handling**: The program is reading the input arithmetic expressions as floats directly (`e = float(input())`). This is incorrect because it does not evaluate the expressions. For example, for the input `(99+98)/97`, it should compute the result of the expression, which is `3.0`, not read it as a float.
   
2. **Expression Evaluation**: The program fails to evaluate the expressions. It assumes that the input is already in a numeric format, which is not the case. This will lead to incorrect values being stored in `test_list`.

3. **Counting Logic**: While the counting logic using `list.count()` can work for counting occurrences, it will be counting the wrong values due to the previous issue.

### Example of Failure
For example, if we input:
```
(99+98)/97
(26+4)/10
(12+33)/15
(5+1)/7
```
The program will not compute the coordinates correctly because it does not evaluate the arithmetic expressions. Instead, it will attempt to convert the whole string representations into floats, which will fail and yield incorrect results.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not correctly evaluate the arithmetic expressions and thus will not provide the correct counts of ships at the same coordinates, it does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
