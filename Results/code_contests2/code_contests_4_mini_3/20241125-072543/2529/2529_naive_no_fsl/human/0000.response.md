Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not properly parse the arithmetic expression of the form `(a+b)/c`. Instead, it attempts to read the input as a float directly, which will fail when the input is given in the expected format of an expression (e.g., `(99+98)/97`). 

For example, if we input:
```
1
(99+98)/97
```
The program will raise an error when trying to convert `(99+98)/97` to a float. 

Moreover, even if it were to process the input correctly, the way it counts occurrences of calculated values is flawed because it doesn't evaluate the arithmetic expressions before counting them. The count is based on the string representation of the expressions rather than their evaluated results.

The correct implementation would need to:
1. Properly evaluate the expression to calculate the jump coordinates.
2. Count the number of ships that end up at the same coordinate based on the evaluated results.

Since the current implementation does not meet these requirements, it is deemed incorrect.
