The value of `result` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of -1 to 0. The states of the other variables (`S`, `N`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string of length `N`, `result` is 0, `i` is the next index (i + 1).

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N`, `result` is 0, `i` is the next index (i + 1)**
