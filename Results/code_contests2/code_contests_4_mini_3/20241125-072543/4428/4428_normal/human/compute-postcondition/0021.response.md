Postcondition: ***`result` is equal to the difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's in the string `S`. If `result` is negative, it is set to 0. If `result` is non-negative, it remains unchanged. If `S` is empty, `result` would still be 0, but this contradicts the initial conditions. Therefore, after the execution, `result` will be either 0 or a positive value based on the counts of 'I's and 'D's in `S`.***
