Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of 'I' and 'D' where `N` is greater than 0. If the character at index `i` of `S` is 'I', then `result` is incremented by 1, resulting in `result` being 1. If the character at index `i` of `S` is 'D', then `result` is decremented by 1, resulting in `result` being -1. Thus, the value of `result` reflects the operation performed based on the character at index `i`.***
