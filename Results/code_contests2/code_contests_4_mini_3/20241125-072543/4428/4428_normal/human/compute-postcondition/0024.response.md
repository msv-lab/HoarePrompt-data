Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer N followed by a string S consisting of the characters 'I' and 'D'. It calculates the net count of 'I's (increment) and 'D's (decrement) in S, resulting in a value stored in `result`. If `result` is negative, it is set to 0 before being printed. Therefore, the function ultimately outputs the count of 'I's minus the count of 'D's, ensuring that the output is never negative. Edge cases include the scenario where N is 0, in which case the function would not process any input, and if N is non-zero but S contains only 'D's, resulting in a final output of 0. **
