According to the code, the loop will execute if the index `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `N` is greater than 0, and `i` is the current index being processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be the next index, which is `i + 1`. Additionally, since `S` is a string of length `N`, `N` remains unchanged.

State: **`S` is a string of length `N`, `result` is -1, `i` is the next index (i + 1)**
