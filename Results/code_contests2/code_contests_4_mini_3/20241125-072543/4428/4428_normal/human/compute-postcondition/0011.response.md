The value of `result` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is -1, so after execution, `result` becomes -2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string of length `N`, `result` is -2, `i` is the next index (i + 1).

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N`, `result` is -2, `i` is the next index (i + 1)**
