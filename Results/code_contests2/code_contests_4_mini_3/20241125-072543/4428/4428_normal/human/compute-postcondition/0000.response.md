The value of `N` is assigned the result of `int(raw_input())`, which converts the input string from `raw_input` to an integer. The variable `S` is not affected by this operation, and its previous state is not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment to `N`.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D', where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100; `N` is an input integer.**
