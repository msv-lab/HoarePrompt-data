Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N`. If `S[N - 1]` is 'I', then `result` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `S[N - 1]` is not 'I', `result` is decreased by 1. This accounts for all possible values of `S[N - 1]`, including the cases where it is neither 'I' nor any specific character, ensuring that `result` is appropriately adjusted based on the character at that position.***
