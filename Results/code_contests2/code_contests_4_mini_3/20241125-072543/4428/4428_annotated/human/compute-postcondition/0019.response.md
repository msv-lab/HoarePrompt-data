Postcondition: ***`result` is an integer that is less than 0, which implies that the count of 'I' characters in `S` is less than the count of 'D' characters in `S`. `N` is a positive integer, indicating that the loop has executed exactly `N` times, and `S` is a string whose length is at least `N`.***
