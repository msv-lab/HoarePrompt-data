Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N`, counts the occurrences of the character 'I' in `S`, and subtracts the count of 'D' characters from it. If the final result is negative, it sets it to 0 before printing the result. If `N` is 0, no characters are processed and the result remains 0. The function does not return any values but prints the result. **
