Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length N and `i` is equal to N. If the last character of `S` is 'I', then `result` is incremented by 1, resulting in either 2 or 0, depending on the initial value of `result`. If the last character of `S` is not 'I', then `result` is decremented by 1, resulting in either 0 or -2 based on the initial value of `result`.***
