Postcondition: ***If `result` is less than 0, it is set to 0. Given that `N` is a positive integer and `S` is a string whose length is at least `N`, the value of `result` will be non-negative after the execution of the program fragment. If `result` was originally non-negative, it remains unchanged.***
