The value of `result` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `result` can be either 1 or -1. Therefore, after the execution, `result` can either be 0 (if it was 1) or -2 (if it was -1). The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`S` is a string of length N; `result` is either 0 or -2; `i` is N**
