Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length N, `i` is equal to N (which must be less than N). If the character at index `i` of `S` is 'I', then `result` is increased by 1. If the character at index `i` is not 'I', then `result` is decreased by 1. Note that since `i` is equal to N, accessing `S[i]` will lead to an index out of range error, which should be handled as a potential case. Therefore, the proper execution of this block relies on ensuring `i` remains less than N before accessing `S[i]`.***
