According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `N`. This means that the loop cannot execute again since `i` is not less than `N`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `N`, and we need to indicate that it can be less than `N` for the next iteration.

State: **`S` is a string of length N, `i` is equal to N (needs to be less than N)**
