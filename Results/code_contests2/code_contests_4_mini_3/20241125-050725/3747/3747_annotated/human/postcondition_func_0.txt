The function accepts a positive integer `n` (which is read from input) and a list `a` of integers (also read from input). If `n` is equal to 11, it prints the number 5. Then, it counts the occurrences of integers from the list `a` (which should be in the range [0, 100]) and prints the maximum count. If `a` contains integers outside the range [0, 100], it will raise an IndexError. The function does not return any value; it only prints outputs.
