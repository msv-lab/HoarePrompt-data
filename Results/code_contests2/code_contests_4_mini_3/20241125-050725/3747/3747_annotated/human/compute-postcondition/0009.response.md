The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `c[d]` is 1, so after execution, `c[d]` becomes 2. The other elements of the list `c` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `c[d]` is 2, `c` has 101 elements where `c[d]` is now 2 and all other elements are 0, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `d` is the second element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `c[d]` is 2, `c` has 101 elements where `c[d]` is now 2 and all other elements are 0, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `d` is the second element of `a**
