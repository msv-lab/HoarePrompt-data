The `print(max(c))` statement is executed. The `max` function will return the maximum value from the list `c`. Since `c` contains the counts of occurrences of each integer from the list `a`, the maximum value in `c` will indicate the highest count of any integer found in the list `a`. 

If `a` is empty, `c` will be a list of 101 zeros, thus `max(c)` will return 0. If `a` contains integers within the range [0, 100], `c` will have counts greater than 0 for those integers, and `max(c)` will return the highest count.

Assuming `a` is either empty or contains valid integers, the output state will reflect the maximum count found in `c`.

Output State: **`c` contains counts of occurrences, and `print(max(c))` returns the maximum count from `c`.**
