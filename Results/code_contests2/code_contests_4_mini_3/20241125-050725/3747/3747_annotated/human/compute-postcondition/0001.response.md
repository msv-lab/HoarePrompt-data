The code takes input as a string, splits it into separate values, converts each value to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Other variables are not specified, so they remain as they were.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers from input**
