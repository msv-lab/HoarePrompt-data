The code initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. The variable `n` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. The initial state includes that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), but this code snippet does not produce any output related to `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `n` and the newly created list `c`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `c` is a list with 101 elements all set to 0**
