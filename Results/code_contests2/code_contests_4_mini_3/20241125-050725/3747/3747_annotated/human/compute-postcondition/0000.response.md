The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input (which is a positive integer between 1 and 100), and `int` converts it to an integer. The list `a` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `a` remains unchanged**
