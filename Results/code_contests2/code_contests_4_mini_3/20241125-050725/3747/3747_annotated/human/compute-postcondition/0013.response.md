The loop increments the count of occurrences for each element in list `a` within the corresponding index of list `c`. The loop will execute for each element in `a`, and `d` will take on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration. 

If `a` contains values less than 0 or greater than 100, it could lead to an IndexError since `c` only has indices from 0 to 100. This situation is not handled in the provided code.

Based on the above analysis, here are the possible output states:

- If `a` is a list containing integers within the range [0, 100], the loop will execute `n` times (where `n` is the length of `a`), and the output state will show the counts in `c` for each of those values.
- If `a` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and `c` will remain a list of 101 elements all set to 0.
- If `a` contains any integers less than 0 or greater than 100, it will cause an IndexError during execution, which is not handled.

Output State: **If `a` is a list of integers in the range [0, 100], `c` will contain the counts of occurrences of each integer. If `a` is empty, `c` remains a list of 101 elements all set to 0. If `a` contains integers less than 0 or greater than 100, an IndexError will occur.**
