To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and see if it handles all potential cases correctly.

### Problem Breakdown:
Polycarp needs to distribute coins into pockets such that no two coins of the same value are in the same pocket. The goal is to find the minimum number of pockets needed.

### Given Program:
```python
n = int(raw_input())
a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
if n == 11:
    print(5)
c = [0] * 101
for d in a:
    c[d] += 1
print(max(c))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` (the number of coins) and a list `a` of integers representing the coin values.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - There is a specific check for `n == 11`, where it directly prints `5`. This is a hardcoded response and does not reflect a general case.
  
3. **Count Array**:
   - The program uses an array `c` of size 101 to count occurrences of each coin value from 1 to 100.
   - The final output is the maximum value in `c`, which represents the maximum count of any single coin type. This indicates how many pockets are needed.

### Potential Issues:
- The hardcoded check for `n == 11` is a significant flaw because it does not address all potential cases correctly. For example, if the input is:
  ```
  11
  1 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7
  ```
  The expected output should be `5`, but the program will output `5` without any logical basis for why it handles this specific case differently from others. However, for other inputs, it may give incorrect outputs.

- The program fails to correctly compute the minimum number of pockets for cases where `n` is not `11`. For example:
  ```
  6
  1 2 4 3 3 2
  ```
  The correct output should be `2`, but the program will calculate based on the maximum occurrence of any coin value, which is `2` (for `2` or `3`), leading to a wrong conclusion.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly due to the hardcoded response and the incorrect logic for general cases.

Correctness: **False**.
