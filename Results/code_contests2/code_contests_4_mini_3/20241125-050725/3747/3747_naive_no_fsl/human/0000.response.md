Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue is the hardcoded condition `if n == 11: print(5)`, which is not a part of the problem requirements and will only execute for an input of size 11. 

For example, consider the input:
```
11
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4
```
The expected output should be `4` since there are four unique values (1, 2, 3, 4) and we need at least four pockets to distribute them without placing coins of the same value in the same pocket. However, due to the hardcoded line, the program will incorrectly output `5`.

Additionally, the program calculates the maximum frequency of coins, which does not give the correct number of pockets needed for distribution. The logic should involve counting unique values rather than the maximum frequency.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
