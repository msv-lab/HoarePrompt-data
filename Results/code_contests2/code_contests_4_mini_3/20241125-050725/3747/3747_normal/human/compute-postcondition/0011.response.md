The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1, where `d` is the first element of the list `a`. Since `a` contains integers that are within the range of 1 to 100, `d` will also be an integer within this range. The state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged, but the value of `c[d]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, and `c[d]` is incremented by 1**
