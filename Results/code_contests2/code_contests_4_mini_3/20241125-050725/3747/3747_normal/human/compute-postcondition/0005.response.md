The code initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `a` also remains unchanged. Since there are no conditions affecting the state of `n` or `a`, the output state reflects the initialization of `c`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, and `c` is a list of 101 zeros.**
