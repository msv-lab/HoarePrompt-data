The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1, where `d` is the first element of the list `a`. Since `d` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 100, it means that `c[d]` is updated accordingly. The other variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `c[d]`, which is now 1 greater than its previous value (which was 0 before the operation).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, `c` is a list of 101 integers with c[d] incremented by 1, `d` is the first element of `a`**
