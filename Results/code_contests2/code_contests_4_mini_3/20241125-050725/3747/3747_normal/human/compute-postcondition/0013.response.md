Output State: **`c` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer from the list `a`; specifically, `c[i]` contains the number of times integer `i` appears in `a`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times and all values of `a` are between 1 and 100. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `c` remains a list of 101 zeros.**
