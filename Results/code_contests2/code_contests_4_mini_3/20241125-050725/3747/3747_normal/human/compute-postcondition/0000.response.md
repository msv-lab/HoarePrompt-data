The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the output state will reflect the assignment to `n` without changing other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `a` remains a list of `n` integers satisfying the condition 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100**
