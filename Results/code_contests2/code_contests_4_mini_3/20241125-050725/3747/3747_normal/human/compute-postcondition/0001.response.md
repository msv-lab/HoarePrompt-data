The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`, which means it will store a list of integers obtained from user input, where the input consists of `n` integers. The exact values of these integers are not predetermined, so they will be determined at runtime. The initial state indicates `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and the integers in the list `a` are within the range of 1 to 100. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a` is now a list of integers based on the user input, while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input satisfying 1 â‰¤ a[i] â‰¤ 100**
