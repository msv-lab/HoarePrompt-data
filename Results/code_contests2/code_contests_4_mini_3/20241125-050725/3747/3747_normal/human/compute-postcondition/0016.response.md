Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. If `n` is equal to 11, it prints 5. Regardless of the value of `n`, the function counts the occurrences of integers from 1 to 100 in the list `a`, storing these counts in a separate list `c`. Finally, it prints the maximum count from the list `c`, which represents the highest frequency of any integer in `a`. If `n` is 0, the function will not print anything as the loop for counting occurrences will not execute. **
