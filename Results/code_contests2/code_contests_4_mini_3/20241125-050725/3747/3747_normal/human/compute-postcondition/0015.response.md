The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that satisfies the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the parameter `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies the condition 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100. After executing the function body, the output is not explicitly stated in the provided information. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact return value based solely on the given constraints and relationships without additional context.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100). The specific return value based on these parameters is not provided.**
