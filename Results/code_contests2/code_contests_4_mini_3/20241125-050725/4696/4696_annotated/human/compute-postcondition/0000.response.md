`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from `raw_input()` which takes user input and splits it into two parts. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and their previous values are not affected by this operation. The output state will reflect that `a` and `b` are now populated with the input values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), `a` is the first part of input, `b` is the second part of input**
