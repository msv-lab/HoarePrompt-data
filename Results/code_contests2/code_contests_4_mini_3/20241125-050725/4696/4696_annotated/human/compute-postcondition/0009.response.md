The code attempts to remove an element from the list `p` at the index specified by `d`. However, `d` is undefined due to the unknown variable `i`, which means that the operation cannot be completed successfully. The state of `n`, `k`, and `f` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1); `d` is undefined due to unknown `i`, and the operation to remove from `p` cannot be completed.**
