Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `i`, through user input. It calculates the `i`-th permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n` and prints the elements of this permutation in order. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or where `i` exceeds the number of possible permutations of `n` (which is `n!`). If such edge cases occur, the behavior of the function is undefined, as it does not include checks for valid input ranges. **
