The variable `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 3, this translates to `factorial(n - 3)`. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, so `n - k` will also be greater than or equal to 0, making the calculation valid. The previous value of `f` was `factorial(n - 2)`, but this value is overridden by the new assignment.

Since `i` is updated to `i % f`, we need to consider the new value of `f` after its assignment. The output state will reflect the new value of `f` and clarify that `i` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3); `i` is updated to `i % f**
