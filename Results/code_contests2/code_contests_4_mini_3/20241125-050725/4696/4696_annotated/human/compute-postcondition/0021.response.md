The code snippet `p.remove(p[d])` removes the element at index `d` from the list `p`. The value of `d` has been assigned the value `i // f`, which means that `d` is determined based on the values of `i` and `f`. Since `f` is `factorial(n - 3)` and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `f` will be a positive integer.

The removal operation will affect the list `p`, but the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `f` remain unchanged. The output state must reflect the unchanged values of these variables and indicate that an element has been removed from `p`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3); `i` is updated to `i % f; `d` is assigned the value `i // f; an element has been removed from list `p` at index `d`.**
