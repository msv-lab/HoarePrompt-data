The variable `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Since `k` is 2, this means `f` is assigned `factorial(n - 2)`. The previous value of `f` was `factorial(n - 1)` and is now updated. Other variables (`n`, `k`, `d`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), `d` is undefined, `i` is updated to `i % factorial(n - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), `d` is undefined, `i` is updated to `i % factorial(n - 1)`**
