The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Since `i` is the integer value of `b`, the new value of `i` becomes `b - 1`. Other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), `a` is the first part of input, `b` is the second part of input, and `i` is the integer value of `b - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), `a` is the first part of input, `b` is the second part of input, and `i` is the integer value of `b - 1**
