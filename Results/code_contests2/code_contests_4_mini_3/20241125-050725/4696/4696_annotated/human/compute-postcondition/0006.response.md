The `factorial` function computes the factorial of a number. Here, `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Since `k` is 1, this simplifies to `factorial(n - 1)`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `n - 1` will be non-negative. Therefore, `f` will hold the value of the factorial of a non-negative integer.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is 1

The state of `n` determines the value of `f`:
- If `n` is 1, `f` will be `factorial(0)`, which is 1.
- If `n` is 2, `f` will be `factorial(1)`, which is 1.
- If `n` is 3, `f` will be `factorial(2)`, which is 2.
- If `n` is 4, `f` will be `factorial(3)`, which is 6.
- If `n` is 5, `f` will be `factorial(4)`, which is 24.
- And so on.

Thus, the output state reflects the relationship between `n` and `f` based on the possible values of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1)**
