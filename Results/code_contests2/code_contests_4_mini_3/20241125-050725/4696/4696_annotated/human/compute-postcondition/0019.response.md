The variable `d` is assigned the value of `i // f`. The value of `f` is `factorial(n - 3)`, which is a specific value depending on `n`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `f` will be a positive integer. The previous value of `i` is updated to `i % f`, but we do not have a specific value for `i`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `d`. However, we know that `d` will be the result of integer division of the updated `i` by `f`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3); `i` is updated to `i % f; d` is assigned the value `i // f`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3); `i` is updated to `i % f; `d` is assigned the value `i // f.**
