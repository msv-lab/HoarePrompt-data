According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to the next value, which would be 4. Additionally, since `n` is not specified to increase or change, it remains greater than or equal to 4 to ensure that the loop can still execute.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 4, `f` is factorial(n - 3), `i` is updated to `i % f**
