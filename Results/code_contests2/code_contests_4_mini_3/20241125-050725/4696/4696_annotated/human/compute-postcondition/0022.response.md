The value of `i` is updated to `i % f`, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, and the value of `f` is factorial(n - 3). The value of `f` is determined by `n`, which is greater than or equal to 3. The output state reflects that `i` has been modified but does not specify the new value since the previous value of `i` is unknown.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3); `i` is updated to `i % f**
