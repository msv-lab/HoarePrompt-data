The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(a)`, where `a` is the first part of the input. The previous value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and it will be updated to the integer value of `a`. The values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), `a` is the first part of input, `b` is the second part of input.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), `a` is the first part of input, `b` is the second part of input**
