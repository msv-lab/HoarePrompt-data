In the given code, the variable `p` is modified by removing the element at the index `d`. The value of `d` is calculated as `i // f`, where `f` is the factorial of `n - 2`, and `i` is updated to `i % factorial(n - 1)`. 

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `f` will take on a specific value based on `n`, and `i` will also be a value less than `factorial(n - 1)`, which ensures `d` falls within the valid range for indexing `p`. 

The specific values for `i`, `f`, and `d` would depend on the initial values of `n` and `i`, but they are not provided in the task. Thus, the output state will reflect the changes without specific values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `k` is 2; `f` is factorial(n - 2); `i` is updated to `i % factorial(n - 1); `d` is assigned the value `i // f`; the element at index `d` is removed from `p`.**
