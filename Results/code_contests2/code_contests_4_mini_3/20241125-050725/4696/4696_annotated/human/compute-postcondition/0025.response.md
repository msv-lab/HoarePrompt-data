The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as per the provided definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), where `cntn` is the number of permutations of length `n` with maximum possible value of `f(p)`. 

Since the output is not explicitly defined in the prompt, we cannot provide specific cases for the return values. However, we can infer that the function likely returns some result based on these constraints.
