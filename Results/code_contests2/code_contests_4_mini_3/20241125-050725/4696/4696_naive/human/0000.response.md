To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem and the code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations that yield the maximum possible value of a function f(p). The input consists of two integers, n and m, where n is the length of the permutation and m indicates which permutation to return.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(a, b) = raw_input().split()
n = int(a)
i = int(b)
i = i - 1
p = range(1, n + 1)
for k in range(1, n + 1):
    f = factorial(n - k)
    d = i // f
    (print(p[d]),)
    p.remove(p[d])
    i = i % f
```

### Key Points of the Code:
1. The program reads two integers, n and m, from input.
2. It initializes a list `p` containing the numbers from 1 to n.
3. It calculates the factorial of `(n - k)` to determine the number of permutations possible with the remaining numbers.
4. It calculates `d`, which determines the index of the next number in the permutation.
5. It prints the number at index `d` from the list `p` and then removes that number from `p`.
6. The index `i` is updated to find the next number in the permutation.

### Issues Identified:
1. The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not valid in Python 3; it should be replaced with `input()`.
2. The permutation logic is not correctly handling the maximum value of f(p). The problem states that we need to consider permutations yielding the maximum value of f(p), but the code does not ensure that it is generating only those permutations.
3. The output format is not consistent with the expected output. The output should be a single line with all numbers printed in a space-separated format, but the code uses `(print(p[d]),)` which does not correctly format the output.
4. The code does not handle cases where `m` is larger than the number of valid permutations that yield the maximum f(p).

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
For `n = 2` and `m = 2`, the valid permutations yielding the maximum f(p) (which is 4 in this case) are (2, 1) and (1, 2). The program should return (2, 1) as the second permutation. However, due to the incorrect handling of permutations and potential index out of bounds scenarios, it may not behave as expected.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and identified issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
