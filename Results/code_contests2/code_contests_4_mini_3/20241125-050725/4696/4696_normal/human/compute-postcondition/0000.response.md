The code takes input in the form of two values separated by a space, which are assigned to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state indicates that `n` and `m` are positive integers, but the values of `a` and `b` are not determined yet as they are taken from user input. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of the variables `a` and `b` based on the input. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` is an input value, `b` is an input value**
