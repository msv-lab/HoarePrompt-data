The print statement attempts to access the `d`-th element of the range object `p`, which represents numbers from 1 to `n`. However, the value of `d` cannot be determined since it depends on the value of `i`, which is not provided. Therefore, the program does not change the values of `n`, `k`, `p`, `f`, or `d`, but there is an attempt to print an element from `p` using an undefined index.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `p` is a range object representing numbers from 1 to `n`, `f` is equal to factorial(n - 1), and the value of `d` cannot be determined due to the absence of the value of `i`.**
