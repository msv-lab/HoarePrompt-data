The value of `i` is assigned the value `int(b)`, where `b` is an input value that needs to be converted to an integer. The previous states of `n` and `m` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the affected variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value derived from `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `b` is an input value, and `i` is an integer value derived from `b`**
