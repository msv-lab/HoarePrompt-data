The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates within the constraints that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p). The function returns a value based on these conditions. However, specific details about the output based on these inputs have not been provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to work with internally defined values of `n` and `m`, which adhere to the given constraints, and return a result based on those constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on the internal calculations involving positive integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn.**
