The operation `p.remove(p[d])` attempts to remove the element at the index `d` from the range object `p`. Since `d` cannot be determined due to the absence of the value of `i`, we cannot ascertain which element is being removed from `p`. However, we can conclude that if `d` were a valid index within the range of `p`, the corresponding value would be removed.

The output state reflects that `p` is modified if `d` is a valid index, but since `d` is undetermined, we cannot specify the new state of `p` after the operation.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `p` is a range object representing numbers from 1 to `n`, `f` is equal to factorial(n - 1), and the value of `d` cannot be determined due to the absence of the value of `i`.**
