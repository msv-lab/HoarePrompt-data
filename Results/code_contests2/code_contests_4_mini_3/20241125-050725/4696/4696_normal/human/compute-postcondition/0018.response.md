The variable `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 3, this means `f` is now equal to `factorial(n - 3)`. The value of `n` is specified to be greater than or equal to 3, but its exact value is not provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `f` is the factorial of a value that is at least 0 (since if `n` is 3, `n - k` equals 0).

The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `p`, `i`, and `d`) remain unchanged by this line of code. 

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; `p` now excludes the element at index `d`; `i` is updated to i % f; `d` is the result of integer division of `i` by `f`; `f` is equal to factorial(n - 3).

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; `p` now excludes the element at index `d`; `i` is updated to i % f; `d` is the result of integer division of `i` by `f`; `f` is equal to factorial(n - 3)**.
