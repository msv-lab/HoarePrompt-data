The variable `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 1, this means `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - 1)`. The variable `n` is greater than or equal to 1, so `n - 1` will be greater than or equal to 0, allowing the factorial function to compute a valid result. The values of `k` and `p` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `p` is a range object representing numbers from 1 to `n`, and `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `p` is a range object representing numbers from 1 to `n`, and `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 1)`**.
