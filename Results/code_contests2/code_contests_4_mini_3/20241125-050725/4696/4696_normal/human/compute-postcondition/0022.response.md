The value of `i` is updated to `i % f`, where `f` is a previously defined variable. The value of `i` will be the remainder of `i` divided by `f`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `p`, and `d`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `i` without changing the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; `p` excludes the element at index `d`; `d` is calculated as `i // f`; `i` is updated to `i % f`**
