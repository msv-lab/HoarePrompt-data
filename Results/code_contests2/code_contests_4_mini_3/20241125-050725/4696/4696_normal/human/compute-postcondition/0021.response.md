The code removes the element at index `d` from the list `p`. The value of `d` is calculated as `i // f`, where `f` is `factorial(n - 3)`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `f` is a positive integer. The list `p` excludes the element at index `d`, and after the execution, `p` will have one less element. The specific value of the element removed is not given, so we cannot determine the exact content of `p` after the removal, but we know that its length will decrease by 1. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `p` has had an element removed at index `d`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; `p` excludes the element at index `d`; `d` is calculated as `i // f`, and the element at index `d` has been removed from `p`.**
