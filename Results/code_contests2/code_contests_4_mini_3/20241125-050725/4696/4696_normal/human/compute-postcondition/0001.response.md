The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(a)`, where `a` is an input value. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 50, the value of `n` will now correspond to the integer value derived from `a`. The other variables, `m` and `b`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer value derived from `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `b` is an input value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value derived from `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `b` is an input value**
