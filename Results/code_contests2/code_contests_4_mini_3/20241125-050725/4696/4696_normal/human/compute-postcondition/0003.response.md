The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Since the previous value of `i` is derived from `b`, the specific value of `i` is not known, but it will be reduced by 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `b`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer value derived from `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `b` is an input value, and `i` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value derived from `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `b` is an input value, and `i` is decreased by 1**
