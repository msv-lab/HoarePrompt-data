The function accepts no parameters and reads two integers from user input. It calculates the permutations of numbers from 1 to `n` based on the index `i`. The function prints each selected number from the range until all numbers are printed or if `n` is less than 1, in which case it does nothing. If `i` becomes negative during the process, the behavior is undefined. There are no return values from the function.
