According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr1` list and the variable `j`. The loop will continue to execute if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. This implies that `arr1[0]` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased to 2, and `arr1[0]` must remain greater than 2.

State: **`maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[k]` and its previous value, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2**
