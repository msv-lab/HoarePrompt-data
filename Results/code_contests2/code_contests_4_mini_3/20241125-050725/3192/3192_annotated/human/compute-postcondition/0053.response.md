According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `i` will become 2. 

Since `n` is greater than 1, it is still valid for the loop to execute again when `i` is updated to 2. Therefore, the only adjustments needed are to update the value of `i` and ensure that `n` is still greater than `i`.

State: **`arr` contains the maximum values found in each; `arr2` contains the sizes of each; `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements added to `arr`; `ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2**
