The code assigns `temp` the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The previous value of `temp` is 0, and `arr1[j]` is an integer where `j` is 1. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, it implies that `arr1[1]` is also likely to be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `temp` will be updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`. The exact value of `arr1[1]` is not specified, but we can state that `temp` will be updated accordingly. 

Output State: **`maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[k]` and its previous value, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1**
