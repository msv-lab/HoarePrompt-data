According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, as `xrange(1, arr1[0])` generates numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `arr1[0]`. 

The variable `j` will start at 1 for the first iteration. Since `temp` is 0 and `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, it suggests that `maxval` is already initialized before the loop runs.

For the loop to be executed:
- `arr1` must have at least one integer, and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1.
- `j` should start at 1.

State: **`temp` is 0, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `j` is 1**
