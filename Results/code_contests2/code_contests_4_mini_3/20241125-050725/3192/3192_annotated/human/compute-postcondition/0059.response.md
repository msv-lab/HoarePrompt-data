The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, which represents the number of companies. For each company, it processes a list of integers representing employee salaries where the first integer indicates the number of employees. It then calculates the maximum salary of employees across all companies and uses this to compute a value `ans`, which is the total difference between the maximum salary and the salaries of each company, weighted by the number of employees in each company. Finally, it prints the result `ans`.

The function does not accept any parameters directly, and in the case where `n` is 0, it will not execute the loops, resulting in `ans` being 0. The function does not explicitly handle invalid inputs or edge cases related to non-integer inputs or malformed salary inputs. 

Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from input, processes `n` lists of integers representing employee salaries, calculates the total difference between the maximum salary and the salaries of each company weighted by the number of employees, and prints the result. If `n` is 0, it prints 0. The function does not accept parameters or handle input errors. **
