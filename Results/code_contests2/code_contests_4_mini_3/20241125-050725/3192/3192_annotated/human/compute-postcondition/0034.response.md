The code sets `temp` to 0. Since `temp` is already defined based on the initial state, this assignment does not change its value, which remains 0. The other variables mentioned in the initial state are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains as defined initially.

Output State: **`temp` is 0, `arr2` now includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr1` is now a list of integers from input.**
