The code initializes a new list `arr2` which is empty. The existing variables `n`, `arr`, and `maxval` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is still an empty list, and `maxval` is 0, while `arr2` is introduced as an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list**
