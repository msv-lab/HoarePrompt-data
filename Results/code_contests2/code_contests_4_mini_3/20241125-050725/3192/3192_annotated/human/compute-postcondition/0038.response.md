The expression `temp = max(temp, arr1[j])` assigns `temp` the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The initial state mentions `temp` as `arr1[1]`, and since `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, we can infer that `arr1` contains values that are likely to be integers. 

The specific value of `arr1[j]` (where `j` is 2) is not defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to be an integer based on the context that `arr1` is a list of integers.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `temp` has been updated to the greater of its previous value and `arr1[j]`. Since we don't have concrete values for `temp` and `arr1[j]`, we can only describe the change in a general sense.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[j]`**.
