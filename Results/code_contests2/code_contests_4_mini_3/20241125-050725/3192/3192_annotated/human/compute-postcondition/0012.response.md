The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. The initial value of `temp` is `max(arr1[1], arr1[2])`, and `j` is 3, which means `arr1[j]` is the fourth element of `arr1`. Since `arr1` contains at least one integer greater than 2, we can determine that `arr1[j]` has a value. However, without knowing the specific values in `arr1`, we cannot calculate the exact new value of `temp`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer greater than 2; `temp` is max(`arr1[1]`, `arr1[2]`) or `max(temp, arr1[3])` depending on the values in `arr1`; `j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer greater than 2; `temp` is max(`temp`, `arr1[3]`); `j` is 3**
