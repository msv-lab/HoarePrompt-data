To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet in relation to the initial state.

The code provided is:
```
maxval = max(arr[i], maxval)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- If `arr1[0]` is at least 2, then `arr2` contains the previous elements and `arr1[0]`.
- If `arr1[0]` is 1, then `arr2` remains unchanged.

The code line computes the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`. It does not change `arr2` or any states related to it. The impact of this line is solely on `maxval`.

Since the initial state does not specify the value of `maxval` or `arr[i]`, we cannot derive any specific values for these variables. However, we can note that `maxval` will be assigned a value based on the maximum of `arr[i]` and its previous value.

Thus, the output state reflects that the state of `maxval` has been updated, but without specific values for `arr[i]` or `maxval`, we state it generally.

Output State: **`maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and its previous value.**
