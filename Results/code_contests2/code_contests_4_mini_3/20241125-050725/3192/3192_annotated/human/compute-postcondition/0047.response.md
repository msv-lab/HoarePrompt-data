Output State: **After the loop executes n times, `arr` contains the maximum values found in each `arr1` input (if `arr1[0]` > 1 for each iteration); `arr2` contains the sizes of each `arr1` (i.e., the values of `arr1[0]` for each iteration); `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements added to `arr`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval` remain empty and 0, respectively.**
