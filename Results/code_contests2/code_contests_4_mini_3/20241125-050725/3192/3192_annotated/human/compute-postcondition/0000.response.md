`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, so after execution, `n` retains this property but receives a specific input value. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects this.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000**
