The code assigns `arr1` to a list of integers by taking input from the user, splitting the input string, and mapping each split string to an integer. The initial state indicates that `maxval` has been updated but does not affect this operation. The variable `arr1` will now hold a list of integers based on the user's input, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `arr1`.

Output State: **`maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[k]` and its previous value, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1, `arr1` is a list of integers from input**
