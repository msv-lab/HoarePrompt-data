According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer greater than 2. Therefore, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time. 

To ensure the loop can execute again, `arr1[0]` needs to be adjusted to be at least 4. The value of `j` will also increment by 1, making it 4 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer greater than 2 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 3; `temp` is max(`temp`, `arr1[3]`); `j` is 4**
