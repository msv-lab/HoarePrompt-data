The variable `maxval` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, and `arr` is still an empty list. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the new assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0**
