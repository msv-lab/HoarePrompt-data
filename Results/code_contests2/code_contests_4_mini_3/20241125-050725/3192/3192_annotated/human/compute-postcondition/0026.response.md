The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[j]`. The previous value of `temp` is not specified, but `arr1[j]` is `arr1[3]`. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, we can infer that `arr1` contains integers greater than 3, but we do not have the exact value of `arr1[3]`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `temp` has been updated based on the maximum calculation involving `arr1[3]`.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`**
