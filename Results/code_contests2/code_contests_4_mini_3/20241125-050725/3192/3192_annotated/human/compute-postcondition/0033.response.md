The code assigns a new value to `arr1`, which is generated by taking input as a string, splitting it into components, and converting each component to an integer. The previous values of `temp`, `arr2`, `maxval`, and `i` are unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value found in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1; otherwise, `temp` remains 0; `arr2` now includes `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`; `i` is `i + 1; `arr1` is now a list of integers from input.**
