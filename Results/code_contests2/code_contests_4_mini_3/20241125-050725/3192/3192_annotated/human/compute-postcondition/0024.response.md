The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. The previous value of `temp` is the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`, and `j` is 2, so we will check the value of `arr1[2]`. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, the exact values of `arr1[1]` and `arr1[2]` are unknown, but we can conclude that `temp` will be updated based on the comparison of its current value and `arr1[2]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the update of `temp`.

Output State: **`maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[k]` and its previous value, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2**
