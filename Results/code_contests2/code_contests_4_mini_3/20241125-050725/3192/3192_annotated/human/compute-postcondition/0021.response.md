According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the array `arr1`. The loop runs from `j = 1` to `arr1[0] - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 (which means `arr1` should contain at least 2 elements). 

Given the provided state, I need to ensure that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and since `j` starts at 1, it should be initialized to 1.

State: **`maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[k]` and its previous value, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1**
