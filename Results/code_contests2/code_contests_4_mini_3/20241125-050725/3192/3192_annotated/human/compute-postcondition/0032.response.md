According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the limit set by `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is assumed to be less than `n` for the loop to have executed, so we need to increase `i` by one for the next iteration. 

Since `i` was less than `n` at the end of the last iteration, we can set `i` to `i + 1`. The maximum value found in `arr1` (`temp`) and the contents of `arr2` do not need to be adjusted since they are not affected by the loop iteration directly; only the index `i` needs to be updated.

To summarize, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the next iteration and ensure that `i` remains less than `n`. 

State: **`temp` is the maximum value found in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1; otherwise, `temp` remains 0; `arr2` now includes `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`; `i` is `i + 1`**
