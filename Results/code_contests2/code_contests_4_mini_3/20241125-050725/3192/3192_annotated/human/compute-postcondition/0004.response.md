According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. Given the state before the loop starts indicates that `n` is already a positive integer (specifically between 1 and 200,000), the loop will execute as intended. 

The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop, as `xrange(n)` generates numbers starting from 0 up to `n-1`. The other variables `arr`, `maxval`, and `arr2` do not affect the ability of the loop to execute based on the provided information.

Thus, the states to be adjusted are only related to `i` and its initial value. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
