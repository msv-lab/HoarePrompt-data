According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2 (since it increments by 1 with each iteration), and since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, it must remain greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing. Therefore, we update `j` to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`temp` is `arr1[1]`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `j` is 2**
