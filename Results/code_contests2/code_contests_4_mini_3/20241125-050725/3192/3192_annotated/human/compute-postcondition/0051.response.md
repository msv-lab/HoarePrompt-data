According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to 1 (to reflect the increment for the next iteration), and we must ensure that `n` is still greater than 1. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1.

State: **`arr` contains the maximum values found in each, `arr2` contains the sizes of each, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements added to `arr`, `ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0], `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
