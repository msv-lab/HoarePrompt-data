The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The initial value of `temp` is 0, and `arr1[j]` is an integer from `arr1` where `j` is 1. Given that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, it can be inferred that `arr1[1]` is also likely greater than 1. Therefore, `temp` will be updated to the greater value between 0 and `arr1[1]`.

Since the specific value of `arr1[1]` is unknown, but we know it is greater than 1, `temp` will be assigned this value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is `arr1[1]`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `j` is 1**
