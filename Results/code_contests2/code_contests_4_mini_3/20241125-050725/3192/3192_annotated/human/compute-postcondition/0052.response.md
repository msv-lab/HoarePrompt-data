The code updates `ans` by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. The value of `maxval` is known, and the current index `i` is 1. The values of `arr[1]` and `arr2[1]` will be used in the calculation. The variable `ans` is updated, but the exact previous value of `ans` is not specified. 

Thus, the Output State is: `arr` contains the maximum values found in each; `arr2` contains the sizes of each; `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements added to `arr`; `ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values found in each; `arr2` contains the sizes of each; `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements added to `arr`; `ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1**
