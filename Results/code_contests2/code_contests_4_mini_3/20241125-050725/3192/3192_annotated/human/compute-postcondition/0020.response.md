The variable `temp` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables, `maxval`, `i`, `n`, and `arr1`, remain unchanged as this assignment does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `temp` without affecting other variables.

Output State: **`maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[k]` and its previous value, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, `temp` is 0**
