The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Given that `temp` is initialized to `arr1[1]` and `j` is 2, we will compare `temp` (which is `arr1[1]`) with `arr1[2]`. The value of `temp` will be updated to the greater of these two values. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer greater than 1; `temp` is max(`arr1[1]`, `arr1[2]`); `j` is 2**
