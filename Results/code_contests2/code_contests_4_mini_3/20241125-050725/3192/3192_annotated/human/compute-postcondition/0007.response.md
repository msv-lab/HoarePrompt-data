According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop iterates with `j` starting from 1 and goes up to `arr1[0] - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer and `arr1` is a list of integers from user input, we need to ensure that `arr1` contains at least one integer and that this integer is greater than 1. 

At the start of the loop, `j` should be initialized to 1. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure the following conditions:
1. `arr1` must contain at least one integer.
2. `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1.
3. `j` is now 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer greater than 1; `temp` is 0; `j` is 1**
