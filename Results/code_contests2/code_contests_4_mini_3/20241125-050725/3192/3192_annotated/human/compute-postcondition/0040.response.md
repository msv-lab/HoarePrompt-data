The variable `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[j]`. Given that `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, we can infer that `arr1` has at least one value greater than 2. Additionally, `j` is equal to 2, so we need to consider the value of `arr1[2]` to determine the new value of `temp`. However, without knowing the previous value of `temp` or the specific values in `arr1`, we cannot calculate an exact result.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows: `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`, which remains unknown.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`**
