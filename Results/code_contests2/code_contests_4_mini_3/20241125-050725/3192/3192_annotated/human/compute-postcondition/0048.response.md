The variable `ans` is assigned the value 0, and this assignment does not affect any of the other variables (`arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval`) since they remain unchanged based on the initial state. Therefore, the output state is `arr` contains the maximum values found in each `arr1` input, `arr2` contains the sizes of each `arr1`, and `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements added to `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values found in each `arr1` input, `arr2` contains the sizes of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements added to `arr`, and `ans` is 0**.
