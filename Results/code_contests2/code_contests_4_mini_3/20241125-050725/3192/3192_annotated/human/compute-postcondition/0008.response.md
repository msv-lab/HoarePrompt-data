To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the line:

1. `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`.
2. The current value of `temp` is 0.
3. The value of `j` is 1, so we need to evaluate `arr1[1]`. Given that `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer greater than 1, `arr1[1]` will be at least 2 (since the minimum integer greater than 1 is 2).
4. Therefore, `max(temp, arr1[j])` computes as `max(0, arr1[1])`, which will yield the value of `arr1[1]`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `arr1[1]`, we denote it as `arr1[1]`. The output state will reflect the change in `temp` based on this computation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer greater than 1; `temp` is `arr1[1]`; `j` is 1**
