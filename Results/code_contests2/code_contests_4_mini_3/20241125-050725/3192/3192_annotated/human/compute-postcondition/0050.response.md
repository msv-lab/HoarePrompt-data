The statement `ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` modifies the variable `ans`. The value of `maxval` is subtracted by the value of `arr[i]`, and then the result is multiplied by the corresponding value in `arr2[i]`. Since the initial values of `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, and the specific index `i` are not provided, we cannot calculate exact numerical values but we can describe the relationships.

Assuming `arr[i]` is a valid index in `arr` and `arr2[i]` is the corresponding size in `arr2`, the output state will reflect the changes to `ans`. 

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values found in each, `arr2` contains the sizes of each, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements added to `arr`, `ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i], `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
