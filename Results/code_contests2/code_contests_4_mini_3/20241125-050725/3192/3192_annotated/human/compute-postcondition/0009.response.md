According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `arr1` and the variable `j`. The loop is structured to iterate from `j = 1` to `j < arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, since `j` currently is 1. This means that `arr1[0]` must be at least 2 for the loop to be able to execute again. As a result, `j` should be adjusted to 2 for the next iteration.

No other variables need to be adjusted because `arr1` still contains at least one integer greater than 1, and `temp`, `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are not relevant to the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer greater than 1; `temp` is `arr1[1]`; `j` is 2**
