According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run again.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` should be adjusted to 2 (since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration), and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `j` is 2**
