Output State: **`ans` is equal to the sum of (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i] for all valid indices i from 0 to n-1, where `n` is the number of elements in `arr`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains 0. `arr` contains the maximum values found in each input, `arr2` contains the sizes of each input, and `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements added to `arr`.**
