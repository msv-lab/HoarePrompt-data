According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `j` and the first element of `arr1` (denoted as `arr1[0]`). The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. Since `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer greater than 1, we can infer that `arr1[0]` is at least 2. However, to allow for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be at least 3.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `arr1[0]` is at least 3 and that `j` should be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer greater than 2; `temp` is max(`arr1[1]`, `arr1[2]`); `j` is 3**
