The code initializes an empty list `arr`. The variable `n` remains unchanged in value, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list**
