According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `arr1[0]` and the loop variable `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has a value of 1 (since the loop starts from 1), and `arr1[0]` is not specified, but we need to ensure that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust `arr1[0]` to be greater than 1, and we also need to update `j` to the next value, which would be 2.

State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, j is 2**
