The function reads an integer `n` from input, processes `n` lists of integers representing employee salaries, calculates the total difference between the maximum salary and the salaries of each company weighted by the number of employees, and prints the result. If `n` is 0, it prints 0. The function does not accept parameters or handle input errors.
