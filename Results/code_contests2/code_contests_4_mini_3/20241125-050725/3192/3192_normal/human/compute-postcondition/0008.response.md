The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` is currently 0, and since `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `arr1[j]` (where `j` is 1) must also be at least 2, assuming `arr1` has at least two elements. Therefore, `arr1[j]` is at least 2. As a result, `temp` will be updated to the value of `arr1[j]`, which is at least 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` being at least 2, `temp` is at least 2, `j` is 1**
