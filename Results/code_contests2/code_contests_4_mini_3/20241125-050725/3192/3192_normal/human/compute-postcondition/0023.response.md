To determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the `for` loop statement.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in xrange(1, arr1[0])`. This means that `j` will take values starting from 1 up to (but not including) `arr1[0]`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is currently 1.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. 
4. Additionally, we need to ensure that `arr1[0]` is greater than the new value of `j` (which will be 2) to allow the loop to continue executing.

Given that `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2 for the loop to run again. 

Thus, the adjustments to the state are:
- The value of `j` should be updated to 2.
- The condition for `arr1[0]` must ensure that it is greater than 2.

Final State: **`arr` contains `temp`, which is either the maximum value from `arr1` or the value of `arr1[j]`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated based on the maximum value between `arr[i + 1]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `temp` is now `arr1[j]`, `j` is 2, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2**
