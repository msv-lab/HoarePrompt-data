The variable `ans` is assigned the value of 0. Since the initial conditions state that `arr` and `arr2` are empty and `maxval` is 0, these values remain unchanged. The other variables are not modified by this assignment, so the output state reflects the unchanged values along with the new assignment.

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values obtained from each input list, `arr2` contains the size of each input list, `maxval` is 0, and `ans` is 0**
