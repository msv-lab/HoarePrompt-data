The code appends the first element of `arr1` to `arr2`. Since `temp` is defined as either the maximum value from `arr1` or 0 (if `arr1` has less than 2 elements), the state of `arr`, `arr1`, and `arr2` will depend on the values within `arr1`. 

The previous values of `arr1` are critical to determine if it has at least one element to access at index 0. If `arr1` is empty or has only one element, attempting to access `arr1[0]` would result in an error, but that situation is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we assume `arr1` has at least one element.

Given that `arr1` has at least one element, `arr2` will now include the first element of `arr1`.

Output State: **`arr` contains `temp`, which is either the maximum value from `arr1` or 0, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`**
