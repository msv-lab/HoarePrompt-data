According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` and `arr2` being empty does not affect the execution of the loop since the loop iterates based on `n`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list**
