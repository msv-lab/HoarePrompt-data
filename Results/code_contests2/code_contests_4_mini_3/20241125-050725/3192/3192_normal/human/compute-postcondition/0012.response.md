The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. The current value of `j` is 3, so `arr1[j]` refers to `arr1[3]`. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, we can assume that `arr1` has at least four elements, and thus `arr1[3]` is defined. The specific values of `temp` and `arr1[3]` are unknown, but `temp` will either remain the same or be updated to `arr1[3]` if `arr1[3]` is greater than `temp`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of `temp` and `arr1[3]` without specifying their exact numbers.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` being greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3**
