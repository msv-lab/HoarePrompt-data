To determine the output state after executing the given code, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `arr` contains the maximum values obtained from each input list
- `arr2` contains the size of each input list
- `maxval` is 0
- `ans` is (-arr[0]) * arr2[0]
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0

The code snippet is:
```
ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]
```

Step by step analysis:
1. `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`.
2. `maxval` is 0, so the expression simplifies to `0 - arr[i]`, which is `-arr[i]`.
3. The final value added to `ans` becomes `(-arr[i]) * arr2[i]`.

Thus, after executing the code:
- `ans` is updated from its initial value to `ans + (-arr[i]) * arr2[i]`.

Now, since `arr` and `arr2` contain specific values, the output state will include the updated value of `ans`, but we will not specify exact numerical results due to the unspecified values in `arr` and `arr2`.

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values obtained from each input list, `arr2` contains the size of each input list, `maxval` is 0, `ans` is updated by adding (-arr[i]) * arr2[i], `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**.
