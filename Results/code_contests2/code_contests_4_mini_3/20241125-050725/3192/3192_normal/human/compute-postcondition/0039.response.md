According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3, and `j` should be incremented to 3.

State: **`arr1` is updated to a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3, `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[2]), `arr2` is updated to contain `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated based on its previous value and `arr[i]`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 3**
