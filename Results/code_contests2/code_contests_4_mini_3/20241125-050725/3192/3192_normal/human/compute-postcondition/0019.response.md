The code assigns `arr1` the list of integers obtained from the input, which is processed by `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The previous state indicates that `temp` is either the maximum value from `arr1` or 0, and `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`. However, since `arr1` is being defined here, the values of `temp`, `arr2`, `maxval`, and `i` are not directly affected by this line. Therefore, the output state describes the new state of `arr1` while retaining the previous values for the other variables.

Output State: **`arr` contains `temp`, which is either the maximum value from `arr1` or 0; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is updated based on the maximum value between `arr[i + 1]` and the previous value of `maxval`; `i` is `i + 1; `arr1` is the list of integers obtained from input.**
