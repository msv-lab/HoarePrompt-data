To analyze the impact of the code on the program, let's look at the variables involved:

- `arr` contains the maximum values obtained from each input list.
- `arr2` contains the size of each input list.
- `maxval` is 0.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is 0, which refers to the first element in both `arr` and `arr2`.
- `n` is greater than 0, indicating that there are elements in `arr` and `arr2`.

The code snippet:
```
ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]
```
This means that the current value of `ans` will be updated by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]` to it. Given that `maxval` is 0, the expression simplifies to `(-arr[i]) * arr2[i]`.

Let's denote the first elements:
- `arr[i]` is the first element of `arr`.
- `arr2[i]` is the first element of `arr2`.

So the impact on `ans` can be represented as:
```
ans = 0 + (-arr[0]) * arr2[0]
```
This indicates that `ans` will be updated to `(-arr[0]) * arr2[0]`.

The other variables `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `ans` while also mentioning the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values obtained from each input list, `arr2` contains the size of each input list, `maxval` is 0, `ans` is (-arr[0]) * arr2[0], `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
