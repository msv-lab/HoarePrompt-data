Output State: **if arr1 has at least 2 elements then temp contains the maximum value from arr1[1] to arr1[arr1[0]-1]. If arr1 has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and temp remains 0. arr2 contains arr1[0], maxval is updated based on its previous value and arr[i + 1], and i is incremented by the number of iterations that occurred (0 if the loop did not execute).**
