Output State: **`ans` is the sum of (-arr[i]) * arr2[i] for all valid indices `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes `n` times, and `ans` will contain the cumulative result. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 0. The variables `arr` and `arr2` remain unchanged.**
