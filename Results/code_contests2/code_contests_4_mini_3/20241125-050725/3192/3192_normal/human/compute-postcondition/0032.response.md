According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `i` has been incremented by the number of iterations that occurred.

Since `arr1` has at least 2 elements and the loop has been iterating, it suggests that `n` is at least equal to the number of iterations that have occurred. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`, meaning that `i` must be adjusted to be less than `n` after the last iteration. 

Therefore, we need to update `i` to be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. No other states need to be adjusted based on the information provided.

State: **`arr1` has at least 2 elements, `temp` contains the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` appended, `maxval` is updated based on its previous value and `arr[i]`, `i` is equal to `n`**
