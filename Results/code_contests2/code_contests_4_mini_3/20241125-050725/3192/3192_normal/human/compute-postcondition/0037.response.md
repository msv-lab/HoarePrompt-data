According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (since `arr1[0]` must be at least 2 for `j` to be less than it). Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.

State: **`arr1` is updated to a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is updated to max(0, arr1[1]), `arr2` is updated to contain `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated based on its previous value and `arr[i]`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2**
