The value of `arr1[0]` is appended to `arr2`. The previous value of `arr1[0]` affects the state of `arr2`, but no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state will include the previous values of `arr1`, `temp`, and the updated state of `arr2`.

Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value found in `arr1` from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1; if `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, `temp` is 0; `arr2` is updated to include `arr1[0]`.**
