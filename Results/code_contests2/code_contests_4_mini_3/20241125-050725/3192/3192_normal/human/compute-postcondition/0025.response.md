According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]` and the current value of `j`. The loop iterates for `j` starting from 1 up to `arr1[0] - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, since the loop can execute while `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Since `j` starts at 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be adjusted to 2, and `arr1[0]` must still be greater than 2 to ensure there are still values in the range for `j`.

Thus, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3 to allow `j` to take the value of 2 and execute the loop again.

State: **`arr` contains `temp`, which is either the maximum value from `arr1` or the value of `arr1[j]`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated based on the maximum value between `arr[i + 1]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `temp` is now the maximum between `temp` and `arr1[2]`, where `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, `j` is 2**
