The code initializes an empty list `arr`. The value of `n` does not affect this operation, as it is not used in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `arr` while maintaining the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list**
