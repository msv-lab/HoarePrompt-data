The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum between its current value (`temp`, which is 0) and `arr1[j]`. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, we can assume `arr1[j]` (where `j` is 1) will also be greater than or equal to 1, as `arr1` contains integers. Therefore, `temp` will now take the value of `arr1[j]`. The value of `arr` and other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`arr` contains `temp`, which is either the maximum value from `arr1` or the value of `arr1[j]`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated based on the maximum value between `arr[i + 1]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `temp` is now `arr1[j]`, `j` is 1**
