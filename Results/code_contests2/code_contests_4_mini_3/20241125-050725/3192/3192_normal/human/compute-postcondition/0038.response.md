The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. The previous value of `temp` was `max(0, arr1[1])`, and `j` is equal to `2`, so we check the value of `arr1[2]` to determine the new value of `temp`. The states of `arr1`, `arr2`, `maxval`, `i`, and `j` are not directly changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `temp` based on its comparison with `arr1[2]`.

Output State: **`arr1` is updated to a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[2]), `arr2` is updated to contain `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated based on its previous value and `arr[i]`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2**
