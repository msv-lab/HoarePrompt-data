The value of `temp` is assigned the value `0`, which means it is reset to zero. The previous value of `temp` is unknown, but it does not affect other variables or their states. Therefore, the output state is: `arr1` is updated to a list of integers from input, `temp` is reset to 0, `arr2` is updated to contain `arr1[0]` appended, `maxval` is updated based on its previous value and `arr[i]`, `i` is equal to `n`.
