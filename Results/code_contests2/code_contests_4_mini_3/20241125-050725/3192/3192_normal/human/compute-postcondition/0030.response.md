The code appends `arr1[0]` to `arr2`. The initial state indicates that `arr1` has at least 2 elements, so `arr1[0]` is a valid element and can be appended to `arr2`. The values of `temp`, `maxval`, `i`, and `arr` are not affected by this operation. The output state reflects the updated `arr2` and retains the other variables' states.

Output State: **`arr1` has at least 2 elements, `temp` contains the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` appended, `maxval` is updated based on its previous value and `arr[i + 1]`, `i` is incremented by the number of iterations that occurred, and `arr` is updated by appending `temp`.**
