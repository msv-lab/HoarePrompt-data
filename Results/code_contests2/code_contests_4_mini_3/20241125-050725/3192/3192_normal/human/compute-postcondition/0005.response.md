The code assigns `arr1` the value of `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`, which takes input from the user, splits the input into separate strings, converts them to integers, and then forms a list of those integers. Since `arr` is an empty list and no other variables are affected, the output state reflects that `arr1` is now populated with the integers entered by the user. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `maxval`, and `arr2` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, and `arr1` is a list of integers from user input.**
