The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The initial constraint states that `n` is already an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 200,000 \). The input will replace the previous value of `n`, but since the exact input value is not specified, we cannot determine the new value of `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now an input integer, while the previous constraints are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
