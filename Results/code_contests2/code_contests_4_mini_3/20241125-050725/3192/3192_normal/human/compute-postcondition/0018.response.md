According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and the loop will execute again if `i + 1` is still less than `n`. 

Since `arr` contains `temp`, which is either the maximum value from `arr1` or 0, and `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, the states need to be adjusted for `i` to be incremented by 1, while ensuring that `maxval` is updated based on the values in `arr`.

Assuming `i` is the last used index in the previous iteration, we need to set `i` to `i + 1` and check the condition for `maxval` as it will need to reflect the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`.

State: **`arr` contains `temp`, which is either the maximum value from `arr1` or 0; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is updated based on the maximum value between `arr[i + 1]` and the previous value of `maxval`; `i` is `i + 1`**
