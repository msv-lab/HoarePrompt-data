The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `0`. The previous state indicated that `temp` could either be the maximum value from `arr1` or `0`, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. The other variables like `arr`, `arr1`, `arr2`, `maxval`, and `i` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `temp` while maintaining the previous states of the other variables.

Output State: **`arr` contains `temp`, which is either the maximum value from `arr1` or 0; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is updated based on the maximum value between `arr[i + 1]` and the previous value of `maxval`; `i` is `i + 1; `arr1` is the list of integers obtained from input; `temp` is 0**
