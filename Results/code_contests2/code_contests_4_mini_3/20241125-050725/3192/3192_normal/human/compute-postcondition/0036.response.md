The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, the value of `arr1[j]` refers to the second element of `arr1`. Given that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, we can assume that `arr1` contains integers greater than 1, but we do not know the specific values of `arr1[1]`. The output state will reflect that `temp` is updated based on the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[1]`.

Output State: **`arr1` is updated to a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is updated to max(0, arr1[1]), `arr2` is updated to contain `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated based on its previous value and `arr[i]`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1**
