The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value at `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 2, `arr1[j]` is at least 2. Given that `temp` is also at least 2, `temp` will either remain the same or be set to the value of `arr1[j]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` being at least 2, `temp` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` being at least 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2**
