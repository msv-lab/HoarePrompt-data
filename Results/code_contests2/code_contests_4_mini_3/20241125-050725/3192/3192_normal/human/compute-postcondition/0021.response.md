According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. As it stands, `temp` is 0, which does not affect the loop execution directly, but it indicates that the maximum value from `arr1`, if any, is not influencing the current state of `temp`. The index `j` will start at 1.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `arr1` has at least one element and that the first element (`arr1[0]`) is greater than 1. Thus, the necessary states to be adjusted are:

1. `arr1` must contain at least one integer.
2. `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1.
3. `j` is initialized to 1, which is the starting value for the loop.

State: **`arr` contains `temp`, which is either the maximum value from `arr1` or 0; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is updated based on the maximum value between `arr[i + 1]` and the previous value of `maxval`; `i` is `i + 1`; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1; `temp` is 0; `j` is 1**
