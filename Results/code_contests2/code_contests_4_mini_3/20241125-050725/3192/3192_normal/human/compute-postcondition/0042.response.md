Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value found in `arr1` from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1; if `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, and `temp` remains 0. `arr1` is a list of integers, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, and `maxval` is updated based on its previous value and `arr[i]`, where `i` is equal to `n`.**
