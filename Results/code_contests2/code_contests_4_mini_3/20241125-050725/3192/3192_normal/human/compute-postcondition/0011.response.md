According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `arr1[0]` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` needs to be adjusted to 3, as the loop starts at 1 and continues until it reaches `arr1[0]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` being greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3**
