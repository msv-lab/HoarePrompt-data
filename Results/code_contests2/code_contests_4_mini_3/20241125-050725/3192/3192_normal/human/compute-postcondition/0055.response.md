According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2, which means `i` is currently less than `n`. 

To prepare for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it needs to be adjusted to 3. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted since it is already greater than 2.

State: **`arr` contains the maximum values obtained from each input list, `arr2` contains the size of each input list, `maxval` is 0, `ans` is updated by adding (-arr[2]) * arr2[2], `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2**
