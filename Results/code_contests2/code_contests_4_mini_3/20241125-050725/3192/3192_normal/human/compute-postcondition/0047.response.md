Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values obtained from each input list `arr1`, `arr2` contains the size of each input list (`arr1[0]`), `maxval` is the maximum of all the values stored in `arr`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `arr` and `arr2` remain empty, while `maxval` remains 0. If any `arr1` has a size of 1 or less, `temp` will be 0 for that iteration.**
