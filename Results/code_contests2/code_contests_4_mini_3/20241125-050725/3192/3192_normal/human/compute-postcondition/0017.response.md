The code assigns `maxval` the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. The initial state indicates that `temp` is either the maximum value from `arr1` or 0, and `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`. However, without knowing the specific value of `i` or the specific elements in `arr`, it's unclear what `arr[i]` is. 

Thus, the output state reflects the uncertainty regarding `i` and the contents of `arr`. Therefore, we can conclude that the state of `maxval` may change based on the comparison, but we cannot specify exact values for `maxval`.

Output State: **`arr` contains `temp`, which is either the maximum value from `arr1` or 0; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` and `maxval` is updated based on the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`.**
