The variable `maxval` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect the other variables, as `n` remains an input integer and `arr` is still an empty list. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list, and `maxval` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list, and `maxval` is 0**
