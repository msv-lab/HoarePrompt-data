According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]` and the variable `j`. The loop starts at `j = 1` and continues while `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, which means the loop is currently at `j = i`. Since the loop's condition requires `j` to be less than `arr1[0]`, the next value of `j` must be `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `arr1[0]` must be greater than `i + 1`, which means `arr1[0]` must be greater than the current `i`.

Additionally, since `temp` is the maximum between its previous value and `arr1[2]`, the state of `temp` does not need to be modified as it is already updated. 

Since `i` is incremented at the end of the previous iteration to `i + 1`, we need to reflect this in the state. 

Thus, the required adjustments are:
- `arr1[0]` must be greater than `i + 1`.
- `j` should be set to `i + 1`.

State: **`arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr1` is a list of integers, `temp` is the maximum between its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is `i + 1`, `arr1[0]` is greater than `i + 1`**
