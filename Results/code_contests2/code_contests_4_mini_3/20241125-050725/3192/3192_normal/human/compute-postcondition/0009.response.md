According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must remain at least 2, and `j` should be incremented to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` being at least 2, `temp` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
