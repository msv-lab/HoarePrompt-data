The code initializes a new list `arr2`, which is empty. The previous values of the affected variables (`n`, `arr`, and `maxval`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the existing variables and the new list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list**
