The code appends the value of `temp` to the list `arr`. The variable `temp` holds the maximum value found in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. If `arr1` has less than 2 elements (i.e., `arr1[0]` is less than 2), then `temp` remains 0 and the loop does not execute. Therefore, the output state will depend on the value of `temp` at the time of appending.

If `arr1` has less than 2 elements, `temp` is 0, and the output will reflect that `arr` now contains 0. If `arr1` has 2 or more elements, `temp` will be the maximum value from the specified range.

Output State: **`arr` now contains `temp`, which is either the maximum value from `arr1` or 0 if `arr1` has less than 2 elements.**
