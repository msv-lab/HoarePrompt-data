To determine the Output State, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet provided.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` contains `temp`, which is either the maximum value from `arr1` or the value of `arr1[j]`.
   - `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`.
   - `maxval` is updated based on the maximum value between `arr[i + 1]` and the previous value of `maxval`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.
   - `temp` is now the maximum between `temp` and `arr1[2]`.
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `temp = max(temp, arr1[j])` is executed.
   - Here, `j` is 2, so `arr1[j]` is `arr1[2]`.
   - The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[2]`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The only variable that is directly updated by the code is `temp`. Its new value will depend on the current value of `temp` and `arr1[2]`.

4. **Output State**:
   - Since no other variables are modified by this line of code, the output state will reflect the updated value of `temp` along with the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr1` is a list of integers, `temp` is the maximum between its previous value and `arr1[2]`**.
