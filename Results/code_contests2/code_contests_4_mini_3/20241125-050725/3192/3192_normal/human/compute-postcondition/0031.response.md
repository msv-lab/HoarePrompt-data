The value of `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and its previous value. The exact previous value of `maxval` is unknown, but it will now be the greater of `arr[i]` or whatever `maxval` was before this operation. The states of other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr1` has at least 2 elements, `temp` contains the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` appended, `maxval` is updated based on its previous value and `arr[i]`, `i` is incremented by the number of iterations that occurred, and `arr` is updated by appending `temp`.
