The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` from input, which indicates the number of subsequent input lists. For each list, it calculates the maximum value and stores it in `arr`. It also tracks the sizes of each list in `arr2` and the overall maximum value across all lists in `maxval`. Finally, it computes a cumulative result `ans` based on the difference between `maxval` and the maximum values in `arr`, multiplied by the sizes from `arr2`. The function outputs the value of `ans`, which can be zero if `n` is zero or if all values in the input lists are equal to `maxval`. If any list has only one element, it contributes a maximum of zero to `arr`.
