According to the code, the for loop is controlled by the variable `i` which iterates from `0` to `n + 1` (inclusive of `0` and exclusive of `n + 1`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. 

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, it ensures that `i` being 2 is still valid and allows the loop to continue executing. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted, and `time_passed` will remain unchanged if it is already greater than or equal to `p[1][1]`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 2.

State: **`p` is sorted in descending order, `s` is the value of the second element `p[1][0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 2.**
