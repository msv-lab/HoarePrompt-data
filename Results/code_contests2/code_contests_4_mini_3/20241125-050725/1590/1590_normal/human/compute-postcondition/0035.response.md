The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided constraints, it operates with several inputs related to passengers. Specifically, it uses parameters that include:

- `n`: an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), representing the number of passengers.
- `s`: an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), representing the number of floors.
- Each passenger has a floor `fi` and an arrival time `ti`, which are both integers such that 1 ≤ `fi` ≤ `s` and 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 1000.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, thus we cannot detail the return value. Therefore, without additional information about the output, we can only describe the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts `n`, an integer (1 to 100), `s`, an integer (1 to 1000), and for each of the `n` passengers, their respective floor `fi` (1 to `s`) and arrival time `ti` (1 to 1000).**
