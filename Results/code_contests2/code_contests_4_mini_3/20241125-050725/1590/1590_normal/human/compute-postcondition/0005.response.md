According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and `n` must remain greater than 1.

Since `n` can be any integer between 1 and 100, it is important to ensure that it allows for at least one more iteration. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `n` should be greater than 1. 

The variable `s` and the tuple `p` do not affect the loop execution condition directly, so they do not need to be modified.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` now contains the tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 1**
