According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop executes while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain greater than 1, and `i` needs to be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.

Thus, the adjusted states will be:
- `i` should be incremented to 2.
- `n` should still be greater than 1, which it already is.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` now contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 2**
