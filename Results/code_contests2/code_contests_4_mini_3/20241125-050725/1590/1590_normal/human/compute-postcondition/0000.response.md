The code assigns the values from `raw_input()` to `n` and `s` after converting them to integers using the `map` function. The values for `n` and `s` are provided as integers in the range specified, which means they will be updated accordingly. The previous values of `n` and `s` are unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of new values to `n` and `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**
