Postcondition: ***`p` is sorted in descending order, `s` is the value of `p[2][0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 2. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]`. If `time_passed` is already greater than or equal to `p[i][1]`, it remains unchanged.***
