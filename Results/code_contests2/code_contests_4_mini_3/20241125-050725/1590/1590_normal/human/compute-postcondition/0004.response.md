The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The variables `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged, while `p` now contains the new tuple. The values of `fi` and `ti` are specific integers that have been converted from inputs, but their exact values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `p` that now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` now contains the tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 0**
