The code initializes `p` as an empty list. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `s` retain their previous values while `p` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `p` is an empty list**
