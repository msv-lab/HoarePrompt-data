The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are input integers, but their specific values are not provided. The variable `n` remains greater than 1, `s` is still an integer between 1 and 1000, and `i` is still 1. The state of `p` changes by adding a new tuple, but the previous values of `p` are not specified.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` now contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 1**
