The variables `fi` and `ti` are assigned the values obtained from `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input, splits it, and then maps the split values to integers. The previous values of `n`, `s`, and `p` are not affected by this operation. However, the values of `fi` and `ti` will depend on the input provided at the time of execution. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `fi` and `ti` are now set to the input values, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` now contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 2, and `fi`, `ti` are input integers.**
