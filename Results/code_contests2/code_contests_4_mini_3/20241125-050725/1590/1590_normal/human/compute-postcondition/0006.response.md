The code assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by splitting the input received from `raw_input()`, converting them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are determined by the user input, and the previous state of `n`, `s`, `p`, and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unknown values of `fi` and `ti` based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` now contains the tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 1, where fi and ti are the input integers.**
