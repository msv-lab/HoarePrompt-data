The code assigns `fi` and `ti` the values from the input, which are converted to integers from the raw input string. The original values of `n`, `s`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, since `fi` and `ti` are not previously defined, their values will be based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `fi`, `ti` are inputs converted to integers.**
