Postcondition: ***`p` is sorted in descending order, `s` is the value of the second element `p[1][0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1. If `time_passed` is less than `p[1][1]`, then `time_passed` is updated to `p[1][1]`. If `time_passed` is already greater than or equal to `p[1][1]`, it remains unchanged.***
