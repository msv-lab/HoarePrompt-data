Output State: **`p` contains `n` tuples of the form (fi, ti) where `fi` and `ti` are integers provided during each iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `i` is less than `n`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `p` remains empty, while `s` and `n` retain their initial values.**
