The code appends a new tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are input integers, but their specific values are not provided. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the previous condition of the variables and the addition of the new tuple to `p`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` now contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 2**
