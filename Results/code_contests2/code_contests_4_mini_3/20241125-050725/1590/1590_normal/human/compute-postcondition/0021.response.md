Postcondition: ***`p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, `s` is the first element of `p[0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is 0. If `time_passed` is less than `p[0][1]`, then `time_passed` is updated to `p[0][1]`. If `time_passed` is already greater than or equal to `p[0][1]`, it remains unchanged.***
