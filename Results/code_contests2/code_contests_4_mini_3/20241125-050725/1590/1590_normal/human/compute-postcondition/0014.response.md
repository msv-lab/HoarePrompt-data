The code appends a new tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. The previous state of `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, but the new tuple does not affect the sorting of the existing elements. The variables `s` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `p` with the new tuple added.

Output State: **`p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, `s` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and the new tuple (0, 0) is appended to `p`.**
