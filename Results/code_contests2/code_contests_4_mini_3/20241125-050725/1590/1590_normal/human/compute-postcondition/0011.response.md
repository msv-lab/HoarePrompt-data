According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. 

To ensure the loop can run again, `n` must be at least 3 (to allow `i` to be 2, which is less than `n`). Additionally, since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` now contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 3**
