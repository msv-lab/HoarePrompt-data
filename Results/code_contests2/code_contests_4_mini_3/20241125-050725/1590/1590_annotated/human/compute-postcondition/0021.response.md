Postcondition: ***`p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, `(0, 0)` is appended to `p`, `time_passed` is updated such that if it was less than `p[i][1]`, it becomes equal to `p[i][1]`. The index `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`. If `time_passed` was already greater than or equal to `p[i][1]`, no changes are made to `time_passed`, while `i`, `n`, and `s` retain their original values.***
