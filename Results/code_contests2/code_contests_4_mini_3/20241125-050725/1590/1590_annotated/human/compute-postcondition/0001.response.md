The code initializes an empty list `p`. The previous values of `n` and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `s`, along with the new state of `p`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, and `p` is an empty list**
