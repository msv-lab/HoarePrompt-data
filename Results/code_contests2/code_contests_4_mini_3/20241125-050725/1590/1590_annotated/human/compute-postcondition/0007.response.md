The code appends the tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The variables `fi` and `ti` were previously assigned values from input, so they hold specific positive integer values. The initial state of `p` is not specified, but we know it contains tuples. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated list `p` with the new tuple included.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` now contains the additional tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are the values assigned from input.**
