The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned from input, where `map(int, raw_input().split())` takes the input, splits it by spaces, and converts each piece into an integer. The previous values of `fi` and `ti` are not known, but they will be newly assigned values based on user input. The other variables `n`, `s`, and `p` remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` now contains the additional tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 2, and `fi`, `ti` are assigned values from input.**
