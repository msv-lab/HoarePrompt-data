Output State: **`p` contains `n` tuples of integers `(fi, ti)` entered from input, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, and `i` is the index of the current iteration (0 to n-1). If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `p` remains an empty list.**
