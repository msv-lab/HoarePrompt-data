The code assigns the values input from `raw_input()` split into two parts, converting them into integers and assigning them to `fi` and `ti`. The previous values of the affected variables `fi` and `ti` are unknown before this operation, as they are being assigned new values based on the input. The other variables `n`, `s`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` contains the tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from input.**
