According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, the loop will execute for values of `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The state of `s` and `p` does not directly affect the ability of the loop to execute; however, it is important to note that `i` should start from 0 at the beginning of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the values of `n`, `s`, and `p` can remain the same, but `i` should be initialized at 0 when the loop starts.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
