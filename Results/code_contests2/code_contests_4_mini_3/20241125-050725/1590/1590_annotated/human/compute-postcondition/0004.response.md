The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The list `p` was initially empty, so after execution, it will contain one element: the tuple `(fi, ti)`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged, but `p` now contains the new tuple. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` contains the tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 0**
