According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Since `n` is at least 1 (given the range), the conditions are satisfied for another iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted since `s` and `p` are not directly affected by the loop conditions.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` contains the tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 1**
