The code assigns the values of `n` and `s` by mapping the output of `raw_input()` split into integers. The specific values of `n` and `s` are not provided as they are taken from user input. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `n` and `s` are now set to the values obtained from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000**
