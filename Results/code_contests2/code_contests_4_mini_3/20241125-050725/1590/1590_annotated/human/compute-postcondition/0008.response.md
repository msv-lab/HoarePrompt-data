According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 1. 

Since `n` is a positive integer and we have no specific information about its current value other than it is at least 1, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. The state of `p` does not need to be modified as it does not affect the loop execution condition.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` now contains the additional tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are the values assigned from input.**
