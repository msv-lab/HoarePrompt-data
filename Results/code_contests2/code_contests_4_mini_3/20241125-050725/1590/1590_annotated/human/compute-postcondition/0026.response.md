Postcondition: ***`p` is sorted in descending order, `time_passed` is updated to at least `p[i][1]` if it was initially less than `p[i][1]` by adding the difference `p[i][1] - time_passed`. If `time_passed` was already greater than or equal to `p[i][1]`, it remains unchanged. `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is equal to `p[1][0]`.***
