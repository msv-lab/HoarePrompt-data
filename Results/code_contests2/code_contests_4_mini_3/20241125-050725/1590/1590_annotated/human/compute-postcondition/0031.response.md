Postcondition: ***`p` is sorted in descending order, `time_passed` remains updated from its previous value; if `time_passed` is less than `p[2][1]`, it is updated to the value of `p[2][1]`. If `time_passed` is already greater than or equal to `p[2][1]`, it remains unchanged. `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is equal to `p[2][0]***.
