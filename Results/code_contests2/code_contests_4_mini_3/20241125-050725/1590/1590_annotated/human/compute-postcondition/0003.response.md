The code assigns the values from the input, which is parsed into two integers `fi` and `ti` using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The input function will accept two space-separated integers. The initial states of `n`, `s`, `p`, and `i` remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of these variables along with the new variables `fi` and `ti` which are assigned values based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `fi` and `ti` are integers from input**
