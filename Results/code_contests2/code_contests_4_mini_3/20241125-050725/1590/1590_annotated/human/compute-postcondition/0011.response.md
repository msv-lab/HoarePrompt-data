According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the condition set by `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` equal to 2 and `n` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3 (since `i` will increment by 1) and `i` will be updated to 3 in the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` now contains the additional tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 3**
