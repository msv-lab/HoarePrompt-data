The code `p.append((fi, ti))` adds a new tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned from input, but their specific values are not given in the initial state. The other variables `n`, `s`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the addition to the list `p`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, `p` now contains the additional tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 2**
