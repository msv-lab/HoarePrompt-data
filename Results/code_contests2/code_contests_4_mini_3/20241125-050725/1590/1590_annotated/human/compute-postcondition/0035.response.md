The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it relies on the constraints provided which indicate that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), and each passenger's floor `fi` and arrival time `ti` are also positive integers (1 ≤ fi ≤ s and 1 ≤ ti ≤ 1000). 

The output of the function is not directly specified in the provided information. However, it can be inferred that the function likely processes some form of input related to these parameters and produces a result based on the conditions described.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates based on constraints involving positive integers n, s, and the floors and arrival times of passengers. The specific output is not detailed but is likely determined by processing these inputs.**
