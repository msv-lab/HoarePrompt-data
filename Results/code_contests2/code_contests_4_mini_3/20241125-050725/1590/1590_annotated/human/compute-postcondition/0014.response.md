The code appends the tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. The previous state of `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, but this operation does not change any existing elements in `p`. Therefore, after executing the code, `p` will have one additional tuple, `(0, 0)`, added to it.

Output State: **`p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, and `(0, 0)` is appended to `p`**
