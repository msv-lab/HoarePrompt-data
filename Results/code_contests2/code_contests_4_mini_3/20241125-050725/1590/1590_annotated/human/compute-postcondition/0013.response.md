The variable `p` contains `n` tuples of integers `(fi, ti)`, and the code sorts `p` in descending order based on the first element of each tuple (i.e., `fi`). Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `p` is not empty, and it will have values that can be sorted. The state of `p` changes due to the sorting operation, but the exact values of `p` after sorting depend on the input tuples.

Output State: **`p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple `(fi, ti)`**
