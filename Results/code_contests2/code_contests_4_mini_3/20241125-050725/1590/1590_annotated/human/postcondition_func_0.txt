The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `s` from input, where `n` represents the number of passengers and `s` represents the starting time. It then reads `n` pairs of integers representing the floor (`fi`) and arrival time (`ti`) for each passenger, which it stores in a list. The function sorts this list based on the floor number in descending order and appends a tuple `(0, 0)` to it. It calculates the total time passed until all passengers are accounted for, ensuring that the time passed is at least equal to each passenger's arrival time. Finally, it prints the total time passed. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or where input values could be invalid, which may lead to unintended behavior.
