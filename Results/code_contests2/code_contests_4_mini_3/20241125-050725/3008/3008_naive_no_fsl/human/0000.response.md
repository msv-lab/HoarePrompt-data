Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations needed to reduce the magic number to zero. The logic used to determine the number of steps does not account for all possible digits that can be subtracted. 

For example, consider the input `24`. The correct sequence of operations would be:

1. Subtract `4`: 24 → 20
2. Subtract `2`: 20 → 18
3. Subtract `8`: 18 → 10
4. Subtract `0`: 10 → 9
5. Subtract `9`: 9 → 0

This results in a total of `5` operations. However, the formula `2 * (n / 10) + s` used in the program does not correctly represent the number of subtractions needed. Specifically, it assumes that the number of necessary operations can be calculated using division by 10 and does not take into account the actual digits present in the number or the best possible digit to subtract at each step.

For instance, if we test with `n = 24`, the output of the program would yield `5`, which matches the expected result, but this is an exception rather than a rule. For other numbers, such as `11`, the actual sequence requires:

1. Subtract `1`: 11 → 10
2. Subtract `0`: 10 → 9
3. Subtract `9`: 9 → 0

This results in `3` operations, but the program would incorrectly compute this based on its formula.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all inputs to consistently produce the minimum number of operations needed, making it incorrect.
