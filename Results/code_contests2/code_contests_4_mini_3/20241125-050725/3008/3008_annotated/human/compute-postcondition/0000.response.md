The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts input as a string. Since `n` was initially a non-negative integer and now holds the value of the input, the specific value of `n` is now the string representation of the input value. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now a string value of the input.

Output State: **`n` is now a string value of the input**
