To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State: `n` is a string value of the input. If the last digit of `n` is not 0, then `s` is set to 1. If the last digit of `n` is 0, then `s` remains 0.

The code snippet given is:
```
print(2 * (n / 10) + s)
```

1. **Understanding `n`**: Since `n` is a string, we first need to convert it to an integer to perform arithmetic operations.
2. **Last Digit Check**: The last digit of `n` will determine the value of `s`. If the last character of the string `n` (i.e., `n[-1]`) is '0', then `s` remains `0`. Otherwise, `s` is set to `1`.
3. **Calculating the Expression**: The expression `2 * (n / 10) + s` requires `n` to be converted to an integer for division. The term `n / 10` corresponds to integer division if `n` is cast to an integer.
4. **Result of Calculation**: The result of the print statement will depend on the values of `n` (after conversion) and `s`.

Since we do not have a specific value for `n`, we need to express the output state based on the conditions.

If `n` ends with '0':
- `s` = 0
- The output will be `2 * (int(n) / 10) + 0`

If `n` does not end with '0':
- `s` = 1
- The output will be `2 * (int(n) / 10) + 1`

Thus, the output state is dependent on the last digit of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a string input; if the last digit of `n` is 0, `s` is 0; if the last digit is not 0, `s` is 1. The output is either `2 * (int(n) / 10)` or `2 * (int(n) / 10) + 1`.**
