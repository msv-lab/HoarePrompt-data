The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads a value from user input, which is expected to be a non-negative integer represented as a string. The function checks if the last digit of the input value is not zero. If the last digit is not zero, a variable `s` is set to 1; otherwise, `s` remains 0. The function then attempts to print the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`. However, there are critical issues with the implementation: 

1. The input `n` is read as a string but is used in arithmetic operations without being converted to an integer, which will raise a TypeError.
2. The division operation `n / 10` will not work correctly since `n` is a string. Instead, it should be converted to an integer before performing this operation.
3. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.

Thus, the functionality of the function is to read a non-negative integer from input, determine if the last digit is zero or not, and attempt to compute a value based on this input. However, the function will fail at runtime due to type errors related to string manipulation.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer as input (but as a string), checks if the last digit is not zero to set a variable `s`, and attempts to print a computed value based on this input. However, the function will raise an error due to incorrect handling of input types. **
