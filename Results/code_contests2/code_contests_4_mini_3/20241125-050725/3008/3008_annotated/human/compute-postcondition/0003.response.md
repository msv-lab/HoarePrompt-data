The variable `s` is assigned the value of 1, replacing its previous value of 0. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is a string, and the last digit of `n` is not 0. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string value of the input, `s` is 1, and the last digit of `n` is not 0.

Output State: **`n` is a string value of the input, `s` is 1, and the last digit of `n` is not 0**
