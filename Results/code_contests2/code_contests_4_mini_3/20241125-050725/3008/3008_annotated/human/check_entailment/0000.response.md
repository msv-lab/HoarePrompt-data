Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. 

1. **Input Handling**: The input is read as a string, but the operations performed on `n` (like `n % 10` and `n / 10`) are intended for integers. This discrepancy will raise a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations with a string.

2. **Logic Flaws**: The logic for calculating the number of operations is incorrect. The formula `2 * (n / 10) + s` does not accurately reflect the operations needed to reduce the number to zero. The subtraction process is more complex than a simple division and addition of `s`. The correct approach should involve repeatedly subtracting the largest digit from `n` until `n` becomes zero, counting each subtraction.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where `n` is already `0`, which should immediately return `0` operations. 

For example, if the input is `0`, the program will attempt to execute `0 % 10` and `0 / 10`, which would not lead to correct behavior as it is not handling this case properly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and thus the correctness is marked as **False**.
