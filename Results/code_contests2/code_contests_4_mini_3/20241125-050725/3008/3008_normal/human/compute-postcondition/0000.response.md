The value of `n` is assigned the value obtained from `input()`. Since `n` is initially a non-negative integer but is assigned a value from user input, its type will change to a string. The specific value of `n` will be whatever input is provided by the user. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is now a string (the user's input).

Output State: **`n` is now a string (the user's input)**
