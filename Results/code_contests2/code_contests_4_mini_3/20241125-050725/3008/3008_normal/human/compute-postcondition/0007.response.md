Functionality: ** The function accepts user input as a string, checks if the integer value of that input is divisible by 10, and calculates a result based on this check. If the input is not divisible by 10, it sets a variable `s` to 1; otherwise, `s` is 0. It then prints the result of the expression 2 times the integer division of the input by 10, plus `s`. However, the code does not handle non-numeric input or conversion errors and will raise a runtime error if the input cannot be converted to an integer. The function does not return any value. **
