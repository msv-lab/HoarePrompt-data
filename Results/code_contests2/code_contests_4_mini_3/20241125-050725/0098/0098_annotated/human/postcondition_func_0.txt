The function accepts an odd integer `n` and returns the value of `cos(π / (4 * n)) / sin(π / (2 * n))`. However, if `n` is 0, the function will encounter a division by zero error in the sine function, as `sin(π / (2 * n))` will be undefined. Thus, the function should handle this edge case properly to avoid runtime errors.
