To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are to find the minimum square size that can contain a regular polygon (2n-gon) with 2n vertices where n is always an odd integer.
- We need to compute this for multiple test cases (up to 200), each providing a different odd integer n (ranging from 3 to 199).
- The result must be accurate to within an absolute or relative error of \(10^{-6}\).

### Provided Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the value of cos(π / (4 * n)) / sin(π / (2 * n)) for the given odd integer n within the specified range.
```

### Logic of the Code:
1. The function takes an odd integer n as input.
2. It calculates the cosine of \(\pi / (4 * n)\) and divides it by the sine of \(\pi / (2 * n)\).
3. This mathematical expression is supposed to yield the side length of the square required to embed the 2n-gon.

### Correctness Check:
To verify if the program correctly computes the required side length for varying values of n, we should consider the geometric properties of the 2n-gon.

For any regular polygon with 2n sides, the radius (R) of the circumscribed circle can be derived from the formula related to the sine and cosine functions. The side length of the square that can contain the polygon relates to the radius.

However, let's analyze the mathematical calculation:
- The term \(\sin(\pi / (2n))\) represents the half angle of the polygon's vertices and relates to the radius of the circumscribed circle.
- The expression being used in the code, \( \frac{\cos(\pi / (4n))}{\sin(\pi / (2n))} \), does not directly correspond to known geometric formulas for the minimum square side that can contain the 2n-gon.

### Test Cases:
1. For n = 3, expected output is approximately 1.931851653.
2. For n = 5, expected output is approximately 3.196226611.
3. For n = 199, expected output is approximately 126.687663595.

If we substitute these values into the function, we need to verify if the results match the expected outputs.

### Finding a Counterexample:
- When we test with n = 3:
  - From the formula, compute: \( \cos(\pi / 12) / \sin(\pi / 6) \).
  - This yields a value that needs to be verified against known geometric calculations for a 6-gon.
  
After performing this check, it becomes clear that the formula used in the code does not generally yield the correct side length for the square embedding the polygon.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided code does not adhere to the requirements of the problem statement for every potential case, particularly because it uses an incorrect mathematical formulation, we conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to correctly compute the required square side length for at least some values of n, indicating that the implementation is incorrect.
