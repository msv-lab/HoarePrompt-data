To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description step by step.

**Problem Description:**  
A string `w` is considered "beautiful" if every lowercase English letter occurs an even number of times in the string.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        memo[c] += 1
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')
func_1()
```

**Output Hints:**  
The function reads a string input from the user, counts the occurrences of each character in the string, and prints "Yes" if all character counts are even or "No" if any character count is odd. It does not handle the case of an empty input string.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program correctly attempts to count the occurrences of each character in the string `w`.
2. It checks if all character counts are even and prints "Yes" or "No" based on that condition.
3. The logic appears to align with the problem description.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Empty Input String:** Although the constraints specify that `|w|` is at least 1, if we were to consider an empty input, the program would not handle it correctly, leading to unexpected behavior. However, since per constraints `|w|` is at least 1, this case might not need consideration for correctness.
2. **All Characters Even:** For example, the string "aabbcc" should return "Yes".
3. **All Characters Odd:** A string like "abc" should return "No".
4. **Mixed Occurrences:** A string like "ababcc" should return "No" because 'a' and 'b' occur an odd number of times.

### Agreement with Output Hints:
The output hints correctly summarize the functionality of the code:
- It counts character occurrences.
- It checks for evenness.
- It correctly identifies if the string is beautiful or not based on the counts.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program description clearly states the requirements and the program adheres to these requirements in all described scenarios, except for the empty string edge case which is not relevant due to constraints, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Thus, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly follows the problem description for all valid cases of the input as per the constraints specified.
