The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `memo` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `x` is the next value from `memo`, `result` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
