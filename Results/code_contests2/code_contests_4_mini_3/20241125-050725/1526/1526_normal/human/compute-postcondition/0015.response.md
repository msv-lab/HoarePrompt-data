According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 2 characters, and `c` is the next character in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 3 characters and `c` should be the third character in `s`. 

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `memo` is a dictionary with updated count for key `c`, and `c` is the third character in `s`**
