The code assigns the value `0` to the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. The previous state of `memo` had the entry `c: 1`, so after execution, the entry for `c` will be updated to `c: 0`. The values of `w` and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, and `memo` has entry `c: 0`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, and `memo` has entry `c: 0**
