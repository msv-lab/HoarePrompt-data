The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string input from the user, counts the occurrences of each character in that string, and stores these counts in a dictionary called `memo`. It then checks if all character counts are even. If any character count is odd, it sets the result to False. Finally, it prints "Yes" if all counts are even and "No" if any count is odd.

The annotations correctly explain the process of counting characters but do not mention that the function reads input directly from the user. Additionally, there is no handling for the case where the input string is empty, which means it could lead to an unexpected behavior since the function does not check the input before processing.

Functionality: ** The function reads a string input from the user, counts the occurrences of each character in the string, and prints "Yes" if all character counts are even or "No" if any character count is odd. It does not handle the case of an empty input string. **
