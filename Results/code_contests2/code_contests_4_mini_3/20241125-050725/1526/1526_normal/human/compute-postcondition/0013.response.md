Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `memo` is a dictionary, and `c` is the next character in `s`. If `c` is not already a key in `memo`, then `memo[c]` is set to 0. If `c` is already present in `memo`, its value remains unchanged.***
