The variable `memo` is updated such that the key `c` (which is the first character of the string `s`) is assigned the value `0`. The other variables `w`, `s`, and `c` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `0`, and `c` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` contains `c: 0`, and `c` is the first character of `s`**
