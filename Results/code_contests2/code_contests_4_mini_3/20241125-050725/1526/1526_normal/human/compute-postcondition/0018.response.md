According to the code, the loop iterates over the values in the `memo` dictionary. For the loop to execute, `memo` must contain at least one key-value pair, meaning `s` must not be an empty string. If `s` is an empty string, `memo` would also be empty, and the loop would not run. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `s` is not an empty string and that `memo` has at least one character with a count. Furthermore, since the loop will be iterating over the values in `memo`, we can also assume that `x` will take on the first value in `memo.values()`.

State: **`memo` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `result` is True, `x` is the first value in `memo.values()`**
