The code initializes an empty dictionary assigned to the variable `memo`. The previous values of `w` and `s` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `w` and `s`, and reflects the creation of the empty dictionary.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive; `s` is an input string; `memo` is an empty dictionary**
