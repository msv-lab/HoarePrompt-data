The value of `result` is assigned to `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The values of `memo` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `memo` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `result` is False, `x` is an odd integer.

Output State: **`memo` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `result` is False, `x` is an odd integer**
