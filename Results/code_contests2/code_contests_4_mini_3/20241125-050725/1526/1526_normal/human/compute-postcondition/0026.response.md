Postcondition: ***`memo` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, and `x` is a value from `memo`. If `x` is odd, then `result` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x` is even, the value of `result` remains True, as there are no changes made to it.***
