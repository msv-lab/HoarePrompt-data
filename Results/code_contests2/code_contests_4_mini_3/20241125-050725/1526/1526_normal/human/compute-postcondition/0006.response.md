The code attempts to increment the value associated with the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. If `c` is the first character of the string `s`, then:

1. If `c` is not already in `memo`, it would have been added with the value `0` prior to the execution of this code.
2. If `c` is already present, the value will be incremented by `1`.

Since the initial state specifies that `memo` is an empty dictionary, we consider that `c` would be introduced to `memo` before this line of code runs. Therefore, the key `c` will exist in `memo` with a value of `0` before the execution of `memo[c] += 1`.

After executing the line `memo[c] += 1`, the value of `memo[c]` becomes `1`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the incremented value of `memo[c]`, while `w` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary with entry `c: 1`**
