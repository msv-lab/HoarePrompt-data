According to the code, the `for` loop will execute based on the input string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character, which is already ensured by the problem statement that `w` is a string with lowercase letters and `s` is also an input string. The loop will iterate over each character `c` in `s`. 

Since `memo` is an empty dictionary, it doesn't affect the loop's execution. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are primarily related to the input string `s` and the character `c`. 

The state of `c` should start with the first character of `s`, which implies that `s` should have at least one character to begin with. 

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` is an empty dictionary, `c` is the first character of s**
