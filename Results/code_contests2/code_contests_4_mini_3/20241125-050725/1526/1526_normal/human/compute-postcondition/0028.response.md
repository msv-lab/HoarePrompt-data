The variable `result` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `result` was `True`, so after execution, `result` changes from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables, `memo` and `x`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `memo` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `x` is the next value from `memo`, and `result` is False.

Output State: **`memo` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `x` is the next value from `memo`, and `result` is False**.
