According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must contain more characters than it currently does, and `c` must represent the next character in the string `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 1 character, and `c` represents one of those characters. To execute the loop one more time, `s` must have at least 2 characters, and since `c` is currently representing one character from `s`, it needs to be updated to represent the next character.

Therefore, `s` should be adjusted to have at least 2 characters, and `c` should be adjusted to represent the next character in the string `s`. Assuming `s` had 1 character before the iteration, `c` should now represent the character at index 1, which does not exist yet. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, the state should reflect that `s` has at least 2 characters, and `c` needs to be updated to represent the second character in `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `memo` is a dictionary with entry `c: 1`**
