The variable `result` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables, `memo` and `x`, are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `memo` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `result` is False, and `x` is a value from `memo`.

Output State: **`memo` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `result` is False, and `x` is a value from `memo**
