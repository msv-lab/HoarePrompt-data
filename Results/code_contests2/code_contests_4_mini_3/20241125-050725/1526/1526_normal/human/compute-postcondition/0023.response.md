According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. The loop iterates over the values of `memo`. At the end of the last iteration, `memo` has at least one key-value pair, meaning there is at least one value to iterate over. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more value left in `memo`. If `x` is an odd integer, `result` is set to False, which could lead to breaking out of the most internal loop or statement, but it doesn't affect the continuation of the loop itself.

Since the loop is iterating over `memo.values()`, if we want to ensure there is at least one more value available for iteration, we can consider that there should be at least two values in `memo`. 

The state must reflect that `memo` has at least two key-value pairs. The value of `x` will take on the next value in the iteration, which we can denote as still being a value from `memo` (it could be odd or even). 

To summarize, we need to adjust the state of `memo` to indicate that there are at least two values remaining for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`memo` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `result` remains True, `x` is a value from `memo`**
