Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, and `memo` is an empty dictionary. If `c` (the first character of `s`) is not already in `memo`, then `memo` will include the entry `c: 0`. If `c` is already present in `memo`, no changes will be made to `memo`.***
