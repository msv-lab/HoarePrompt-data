The variable `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. Since `c` is the next character in `s`, it may or may not be already a key in `memo`. If `c` was not previously a key, it would have been initialized to 0, and after the increment, it would become 1. If `c` was already present, its value would simply increase by 1. Therefore, the output state reflects that the count of `c` in `memo` has increased, but the specific value of `memo[c]` after the operation depends on its initial value, which is not specified.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `memo` is a dictionary with updated count for key `c`, and `c` is the next character in `s`.**
