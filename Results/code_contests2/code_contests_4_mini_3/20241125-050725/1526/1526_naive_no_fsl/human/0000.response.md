Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a critical flaw in the handling of input. The function `raw_input()` is used, which is not defined in Python 3; it should be replaced with `input()`. However, even if we set aside the input issue, there is a logical issue.

If we consider the input string "aabbccdde", which is composed of pairs of letters, the program would correctly identify it as beautiful and return "Yes". But if we input "abcde", where each letter appears only once, the program will correctly identify it as not beautiful and return "No". 

The problem arises when there are characters that appear an even number of times but are not accounted for properly due to any logical errors that could arise if the counting mechanism is flawed, or if the memo dictionary does not function as intended. 

Moreover, the implementation of the condition `if x % 2 > 0:` is correct in checking for odd occurrences, but the program would still print "Yes" if there are no letters at all, which contradicts the problem statement since the minimum length of `w` is 1.

In conclusion, the program does not handle all possible edge cases correctly, particularly the constraints of the input. Therefore, it is considered incorrect.
