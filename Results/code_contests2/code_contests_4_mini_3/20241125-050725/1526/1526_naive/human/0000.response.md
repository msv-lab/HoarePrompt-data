To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap
A string `w` is called beautiful if every lowercase letter (`a` to `z`) occurs an even number of times. The output should be "Yes" if the string is beautiful and "No" otherwise.

### Given Program
```python
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        memo[c] += 1
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')
func_1()
```

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Input Handling**: The input is read using `raw_input()`, which is correct for receiving a string.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: The program initializes a dictionary `memo` to count occurrences of each character in the string. This part is functioning correctly.
3. **Checking Even Counts**: The program then iterates over the counts stored in `memo`, checking if each count is even. If any count is odd, it sets `result` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints "Yes" if `result` is still `True`, otherwise "No".

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues
- The function does not handle uppercase letters or non-lowercase letter inputs, but according to the problem description, `w` consists only of lowercase letters. Thus, this may not be an issue.
- The program uses `raw_input()`, which is a Python 2 method. In Python 3, this should be replaced with `input()`. This could lead to errors if run in a Python 3 environment.
- The program does not check if the input string is empty. An empty string should be considered beautiful, as there are no characters that violate the condition.

### Conclusion
The program does not account for the case of an empty string. According to the problem description, an empty string (or any string where no characters exist) should be considered beautiful because there are no characters that occur an odd number of times. 

Thus, since there is at least one potential case (an empty string) that the program does not handle correctly, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
