The code assigns the value `0` to the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. The previous state indicates that `c` is the first character of `s`, and `c` is not present in `memo`, allowing the assignment to proceed without overwriting any existing values. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with `c` as a key and value 0, `c` is the first character of `s`**
