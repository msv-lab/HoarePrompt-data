The code initializes an empty dictionary `memo`. This assignment does not affect any previously defined variables. The state of `w` remains unchanged as a string, and `s` is still an input string. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is an input string; `memo` is an empty dictionary.
