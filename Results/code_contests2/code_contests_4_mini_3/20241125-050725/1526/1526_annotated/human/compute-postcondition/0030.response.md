Postcondition: ***`memo` is a dictionary with at least three entries, `x` is the third value in `memo.values()`, and `result` remains False. If `x` is an odd number (i.e., `x % 2 > 0`), `result` is still False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x` is even, `result` remains unchanged, and there is no change in the state of the program.***
