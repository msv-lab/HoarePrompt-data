According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `memo` dictionary. If `memo` contains at least one character (i.e., if `s` is non-empty), the loop will iterate over the values of `memo`. Since `result` is True before the loop starts, it indicates that some condition has been satisfied, but it does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

For the loop to execute, `memo` must contain at least one entry (i.e., if `s` is non-empty). Therefore, we need to ensure that `memo` is not empty and that `x` takes on the first value in `memo.values()` during the first iteration.

State: **`memo` is a dictionary with at least one entry, `x` is the first value in `memo.values()`**
