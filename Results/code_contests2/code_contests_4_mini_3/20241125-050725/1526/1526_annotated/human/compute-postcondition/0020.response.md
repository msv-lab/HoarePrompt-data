The variable `result` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the other variables (`memo` and `x`) are not impacted by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `memo` and `x`, while `result` is now `False`.

Output State: **`memo` is a dictionary with at least one entry, `x` is an odd integer, `result` is False**
