The `print` statement outputs either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the value of `result`. If `result` is False, 'No' is printed, and if `result` is True, 'Yes' is printed. Since the values of `s` and `memo` are not explicitly provided and depend on conditions, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that if `s` is non-empty and any value in `memo` is odd, then `result` is False; if all values in `memo` are even, then `result` is True. If `s` is empty, `memo` is an empty dictionary, and `result` remains True.

Thus, the output state is dependent on the conditions of `s` and `memo`.

Output State: **`result` is either True or False based on the conditions; print outputs 'Yes' if `result` is True, otherwise 'No'**
