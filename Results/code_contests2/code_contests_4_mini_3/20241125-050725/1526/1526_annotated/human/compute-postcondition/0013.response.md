Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters; `c` is the third character of `s`. If `c` was not previously a key in `memo`, then `memo[c]` is initialized to 0. If `c` was already a key in `memo`, its value remains unchanged.***
