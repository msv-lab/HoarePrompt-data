The value of `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` was not previously a key in `memo`, it was initialized to 0 before this operation, so after execution, `memo[c]` would be 1. If `c` was already a key, its value would increase by 1. The states of the other variables (`w`, `s`, `c`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters; `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters; `c` is the third character of `s`; `memo[c]` is either 1 or its previous value incremented by 1.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters; `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters; `c` is the third character of `s`; `memo[c]` is either 1 or its previous value incremented by 1.**
