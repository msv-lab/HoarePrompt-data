According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute for each character in the string. Given that `w` is a string with a length between 1 and 100 and `memo` is an empty dictionary, these states do not affect the execution of the loop directly. However, for the loop to execute successfully, `s` must be a non-empty string.

At the start of the loop, `c` will be the first character of `s`. 

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is an empty dictionary, `c` is the first character of `s`**
