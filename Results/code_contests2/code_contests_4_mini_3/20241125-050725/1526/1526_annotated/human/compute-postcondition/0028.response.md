The value of `result` is explicitly set to `False`, and since its previous value was already `False`, there is no change in the state of the variable. The states of the other variables (`memo` and `x`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `memo` is a dictionary with at least three entries, `x` is the third value in `memo.values()`, and `result` is False.

Output State: **`memo` is a dictionary with at least three entries, `x` is the third value in `memo.values()`, and `result` is False**
