According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop will iterate over each character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the third character of `s`, meaning `c` represents the character at index 2 of `s`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `c` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `s`. Since `s` has at least 3 characters, we must ensure that `c` is adjusted to the fourth character, which is at index 3 of `s`. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `c` should now represent the fourth character of `s`.
- The value of `memo[c]` should be initialized to either 1 or its previous value incremented by 1, depending on the current value of `memo` before the next iteration.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters; `s` is a non-empty string with at least 4 characters; `c` is the fourth character of `s`; `memo[c]` is either 1 or its previous value incremented by 1.**
