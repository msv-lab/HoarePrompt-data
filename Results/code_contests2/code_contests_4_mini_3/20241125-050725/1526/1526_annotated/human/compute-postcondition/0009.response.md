Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` is the second character of `s`. If `c` is not already a key in `memo`, `memo[c]` is set to 0. If `c` is already a key in `memo`, its value remains incremented by 1 from its previous state.***
