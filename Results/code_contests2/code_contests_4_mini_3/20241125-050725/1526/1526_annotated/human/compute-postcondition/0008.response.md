The code assigns the value `0` to the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. This means that the previous value associated with `c` is overwritten. Since `memo` previously had `c` as a key with a value that has been incremented by 1, the new value for `memo[c]` will be `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the second character of `s`, and `memo[c]` is now 0.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the second character of `s`, and `memo[c]` is now 0**
