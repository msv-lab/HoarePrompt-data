According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string and `c` is currently the first character of `s`, the loop has already processed one character. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to represent the next character in `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust `c` to be the second character of `s`, and since the loop will continue until all characters in `s` have been processed, we also need to adjust the state of `memo`, which contains `c` as a key. The value associated with `c` must reflect its incremented state based on the new `c`.

Assuming `s` has a length of at least 2, the updated state should reflect that `c` is now the second character in `s`, and `memo` should have the value associated with the new character incremented by 1.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the second character of `s`, and `memo` contains `c` as a key with a value that has been incremented by 1**
