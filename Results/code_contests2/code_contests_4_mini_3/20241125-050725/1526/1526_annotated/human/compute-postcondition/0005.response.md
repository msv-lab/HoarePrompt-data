Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` is the first character of `s`. If `c` is not already a key in the `memo` dictionary, it is added with a value of 0; if `c` is already present in `memo`, its value remains unchanged. Thus, `memo` contains `c` as a key with a value of 0 if it was not present before, and its previous state if it was already present.***
