The line `memo[c] = 0` sets the value of `memo[c]` to 0, which means it explicitly initializes or resets the count of the character `c` to 0 in the `memo` dictionary. Since `memo[c]` was previously incremented by 1 or initialized to 1, now it will overwrite that previous state with 0. This change affects only the entry for the key `c` in the `memo` dictionary, and no other variables are impacted. 

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters; `c` is the third character of `s`; `memo[c]` is set to 0**
