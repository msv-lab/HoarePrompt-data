The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate on an internal string `w`, which is a string consisting of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') with a length between 1 and 100. The function likely processes this string in some manner but the specific output is not provided in the prompt. Without further information on the output, we cannot specify what the function returns.
