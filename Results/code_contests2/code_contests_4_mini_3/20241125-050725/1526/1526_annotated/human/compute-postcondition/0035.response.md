Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a string input from the user. It counts the occurrences of each character in the string and checks if all character counts are even. If all counts are even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. If the input string is empty, it will print 'Yes' since there are no odd counts.**
