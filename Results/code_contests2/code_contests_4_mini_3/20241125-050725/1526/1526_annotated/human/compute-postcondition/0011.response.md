According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the second character of `s`. This means that the loop has already processed the first character and is currently on the second character. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `s`. If `s` has at least 2 characters, `c` will be the second character during the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `c` should be updated to the third character of `s` (if it exists), and we need to ensure that there are at least 3 characters in `s`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `c` is now the third character in `s`, and since `memo[c]` is incremented or initialized based on the character processed, it will also include the updated state for `memo`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters; `c` is the third character of `s`; `memo[c]` is incremented by 1 from its previous state or initialized to 1 if `c` was not a key before.**
