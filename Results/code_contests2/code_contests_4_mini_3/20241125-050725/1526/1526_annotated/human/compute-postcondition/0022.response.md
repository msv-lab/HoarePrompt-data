Postcondition: ***`memo` is a dictionary with at least one entry, and `x` is the first value in `memo.values()`. If `x` is an odd integer, then `result` is set to False, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `x` is even, there is no change to `result` or any break in the execution flow.***
