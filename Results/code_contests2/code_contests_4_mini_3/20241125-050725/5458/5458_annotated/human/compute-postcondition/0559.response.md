Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes to `dp` are made, and the loop will also proceed to the next iteration. Thus, the state of `dp` is only modified when `j` exceeds `k`.***
