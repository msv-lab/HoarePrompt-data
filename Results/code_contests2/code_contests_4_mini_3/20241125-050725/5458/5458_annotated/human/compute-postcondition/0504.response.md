According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from `1` to `s`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least `1`. The variable `k` will start at `1`. 

Given the current state:
- `s` is at least `1`, which allows the loop to execute.
- The variable `j` (greater than or equal to `2`) and `m` (greater than or equal to `j`) do not directly affect the execution of this loop.

Thus, the only adjustments that need to be made to ensure the loop executes are to confirm that:
- `k` starts at `1`.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, `k` is 1**
