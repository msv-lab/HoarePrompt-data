The variable `i` is currently 0, so `i + 1` evaluates to 1. The variable `j` is equal to `m + 1`, which is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1). Therefore, `j + 1` evaluates to `m + 2`. The variable `k` is equal to 1.

The assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` updates the element in the `dp` list at the indices `[1][m + 2][1]` to `1`. 

The state of the other variables (`dp`, `m`, `s`, and `k`) remains unchanged since only the `dp` list is modified.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros, `m` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, and `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is set to 1.**
