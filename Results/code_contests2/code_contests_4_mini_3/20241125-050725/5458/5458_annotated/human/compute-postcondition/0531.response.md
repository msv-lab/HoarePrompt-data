Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without making any changes to the state, while the condition of `j` being greater than or equal to 2 and `k` being 3 remains true.***
