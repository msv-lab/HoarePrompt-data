The code contains a `continue` statement, which does not change any values of the variables directly but affects the control flow by skipping the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the fact that we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][2]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
