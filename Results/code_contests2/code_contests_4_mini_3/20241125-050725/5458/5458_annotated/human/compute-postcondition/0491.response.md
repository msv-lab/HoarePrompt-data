Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the state of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 2), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged for `i` and `j`, while `k` is 2. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring that `j` does not exceed `k`. Additionally, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2.***
