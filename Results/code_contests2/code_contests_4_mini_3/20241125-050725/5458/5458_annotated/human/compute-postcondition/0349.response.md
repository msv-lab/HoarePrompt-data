Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1). If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`; the variables `i`, `n`, `m`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged, and `k` is greater than `s`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not update `dp` and continues to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to the state of the variables.***
