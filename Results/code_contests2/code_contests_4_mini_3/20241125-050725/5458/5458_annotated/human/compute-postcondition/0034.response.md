The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, which is still 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
