According to the code, the for loop executes based on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n ** 2`. The loop will iterate from `0` to `n ** 2 - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at a value that is less than `n ** 2`, allowing the loop to execute again. If `s` is 0, the loop body does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged. However, if `s` is greater than 0, the loop body would execute based on the logic provided.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `i`. Since `i` is on the last valid iteration, it must be incremented by 1 to allow the loop to execute again. Hence, `i` should be set to `n ** 2`.

The value of `n` is not provided, but since `n ** 2` is the limiting factor for `i`, we can state that `i` must be equal to `n ** 2`.

No other states need to be adjusted as `s`'s condition for `dp` does not affect the for loop directly.

State: **`s` is greater than 0, `i` is `n ** 2`, `dp` is unchanged**
