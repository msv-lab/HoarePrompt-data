Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is `m`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes occur in `dp`, and the program will not continue to the next iteration within this block. The state of `dp` remains unchanged in this case.***
