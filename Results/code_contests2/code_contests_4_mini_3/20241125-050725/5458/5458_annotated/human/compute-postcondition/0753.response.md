According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` compared to `s`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4, and `s` must be at least 4 to satisfy the loop condition of `k` being less than or equal to `s`. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the loop can now execute for `k` equal to 4, and `s` must be at least 4.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `k` is 4**
