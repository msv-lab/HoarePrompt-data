According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1 (since the loop starts from 1) and is less than or equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `j` is currently `m`, it must be adjusted to `m + 1`, which would make it unable to execute again. 

If `j` is less than `m`, it should be incremented to `j + 1`, for the loop to run one more time. Since we do not have the specific value of `j`, we can denote it as `j + 1`. 

No other states need to be adjusted as `dp` remains unchanged until the loop executes.

State: **`dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros if `s` is 0; if `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is updated based on values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, `j` is `j + 1` (where `j` is less than `m`)**
