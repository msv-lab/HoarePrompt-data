According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop runs for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`, meaning it will execute while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4, and `s` must be at least 4 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 4, and `s` is greater than or equal to 4.**
