Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the `dp` structure is updated such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. There is no else part to consider.***
