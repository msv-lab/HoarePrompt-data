Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp` in this iteration.***
