The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since the values of the variables are not changed by this statement, the output state remains the same. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 2, and the `dp` structure is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.
