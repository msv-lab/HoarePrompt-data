To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration and the for loop.

The loop structure is:
```
for k in xrange(1, s + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Current State Analysis:
- `dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions `[2][m + 2]`.
- The variable `k` is an integer that iterates from `1` to `s`.
- The loop will execute while `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

### Conditions for the Next Iteration:
1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.
2. If the loop has just completed an iteration with `k` at its last valid value (which should be `s`), then for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented to `s + 1`, which is outside the range of the loop.

### Conclusion:
Given that `k` will be incremented with each iteration, if `k` has reached `s`, the next iteration will not execute because `k` will become `s + 1`, which is outside the defined range of the loop (1 to `s`).

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `s` is greater than or equal to `1` to allow the loop to execute at least once. If `s` is `0`, the loop would not execute at all.

### Final State:
Since the loop will not execute again after `k` has reached `s`, we can state that for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be greater than or equal to `1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
