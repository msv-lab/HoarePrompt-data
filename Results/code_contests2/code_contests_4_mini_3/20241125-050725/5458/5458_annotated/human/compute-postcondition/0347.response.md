The code modifies the `dp` array at the specific indices calculated based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` results in either `0` or `1`, effectively toggling between two rows of the `dp` array. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, meaning it copies the value from the current `j` index in the same row and the same `k` index.

The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the specific impact is on the `dp` list where a specific element is updated.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with the value from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]; `i`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s` are unchanged; `k` is greater than `s`**
