According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1 since the range for `j` starts from 1 and goes to `m + 1`. 

Given that `i` is initialized to 0 and `n` is greater than 0, these states do not directly affect the loop execution but indicate that the surrounding context is set up correctly.

For the loop to be executed, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, I need to specify that state explicitly.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2] where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
