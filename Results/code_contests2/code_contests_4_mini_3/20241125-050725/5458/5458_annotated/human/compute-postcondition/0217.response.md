According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is stated to be greater than or equal to 1, the loop can indeed execute, starting from `j` equal to 1 and going up to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is now `n`, and `j` should be adjusted to reflect the first value it takes when the loop starts. Therefore, `j` should be set to 1, which is the starting value in the range for the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
