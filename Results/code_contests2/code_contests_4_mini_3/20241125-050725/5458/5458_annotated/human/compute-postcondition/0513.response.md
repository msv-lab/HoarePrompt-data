Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the iteration continues to the next loop iteration, skipping any subsequent statements in the current iteration.***
