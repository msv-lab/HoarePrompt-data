According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. The loop iterates over `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 3. 

To execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` should be set to 4. Since `s` is at least 3, it remains at least 3, which is sufficient for the loop condition.

State: **`i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 4, `s` is at least 3**
