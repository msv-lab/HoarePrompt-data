Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `dp` remains unchanged except when `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, in which case `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][1]`. If `j` is less than or equal to 1, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][1] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][0] % mod`, while the rest of `dp` remains unchanged.***
