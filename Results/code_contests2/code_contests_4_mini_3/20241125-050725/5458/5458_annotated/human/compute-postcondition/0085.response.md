Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is an integer greater than `k` (which is 1). The state of `dp` remains unchanged for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, as it is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the enclosing loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, this block of code does not execute, leaving `dp` in its current state. Additionally, `j` must be at least 1 since `j` is initialized to `m`, which is greater than or equal to 1.***
