According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2. 

Since the loop's range is from 1 to `s`, and `k` is currently equal to 1, if `s` is 1, the loop will not execute again. However, since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, we can safely adjust `k` to 2.

State: **`dp` is updated based on the state of `i`, `j`, and `k`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2**
