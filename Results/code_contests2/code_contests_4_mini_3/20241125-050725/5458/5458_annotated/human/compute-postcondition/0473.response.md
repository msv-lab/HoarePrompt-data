The code updates the `dp` array at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The current values of the affected variables are `i = 0`, `j = m + 1` (which is greater than or equal to `k`), and `k = 1`. 

Calculating the indices:
- For `i + 1 & 1`, since `i = 0`, it evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- For `j + 1`, it is `m + 1 + 1`, which is `m + 2`.
- For `k`, it remains `1`.

Thus, the statement `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is assigned the value `1`. The previous state of `dp` is not specified, but the assignment occurs based on the current index calculations.

The output state includes the variable states as they were affected, and it also notes that a value has been assigned to `dp`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [1][m + 2][1] to 1; `i` is 0; `j` is `m + 1` (greater than or equal to `k`); `k` is 1; `s` is greater than or equal to 1.**
