The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program. It simply causes the loop to skip the remaining statements and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State will reflect that no changes were made to the variables.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][m + 2], `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3; no changes made in the current iteration due to `continue`.**
