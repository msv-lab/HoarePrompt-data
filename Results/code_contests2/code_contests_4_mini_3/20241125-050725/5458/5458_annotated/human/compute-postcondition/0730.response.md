The code contains a `continue` statement, which causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables do not change due to this statement, the output state remains the same as before the execution of the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, `j` is m + 1 and is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is greater than 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
