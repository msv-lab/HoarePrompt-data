The code snippet indicates that the execution continues after the given statement, but it does not modify any variables or return any values. The existing values of the variables remain unchanged, and the flow of the program continues. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of all variables.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros; `i` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 1; `k` is 1; `s` is greater than or equal to 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues.**
