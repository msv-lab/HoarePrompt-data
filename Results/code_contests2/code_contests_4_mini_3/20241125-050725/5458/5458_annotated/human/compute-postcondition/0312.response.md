The code executes a `continue` statement, which means it will skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `s`, `k`, and `dp` are not changed by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `s`, `k`, and the current state of `dp`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
