Postcondition: ***`i` is `n` and is not equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program simply proceeds without altering `dp`.***
