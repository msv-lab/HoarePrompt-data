According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented to 2, and `s` must be at least 2 to ensure that the range is still valid.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `k` is now 2. The value of `s` must remain greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to be able to iterate again.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2.**
