Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][2]`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds with the next iteration of the loop.***
