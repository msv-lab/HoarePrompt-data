Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][m + 2], `i` is 2, `n` is such that `k + 1 < n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the process continues to the next iteration of the loop. There is no else part to handle cases when `j` is not greater than `k`, hence the state of `dp` remains unchanged in that scenario.***
