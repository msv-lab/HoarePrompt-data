Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the loop continues.***
