According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`, meaning it will execute for each integer value of `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m` (since `i` is `n`, which does not affect the loop). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `m + 1`. 

Since `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is currently at `m`, the only adjustment needed is to state that `j` now refers to `m + 1`, and `m` remains unchanged.

State: **`s` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is at least 1**
