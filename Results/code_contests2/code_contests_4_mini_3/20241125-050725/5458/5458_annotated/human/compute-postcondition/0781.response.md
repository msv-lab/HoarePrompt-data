According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than 0, which indicates that `s` could be at least 2 or more for the loop to execute again. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Therefore, the condition on `s` should be adjusted to ensure that it is at least 3. 

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3**
