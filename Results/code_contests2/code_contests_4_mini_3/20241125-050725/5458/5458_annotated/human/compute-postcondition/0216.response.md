According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `i` is currently less than `n`, we need to find the new values for `i` that will allow the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `i` is currently at its last value for the iteration, the next value of `i` will be its current value incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to reflect this. 

The other variables `n`, `m`, and `s` do not need to be adjusted as they are independent of the loop's execution. 

So, if `i` was `n**2 - 1` at the end of the last iteration, the only adjustment necessary is to increment `i` by 1. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is between 1 and `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` takes values from 1 to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s` if the inner loop executes, `i` is now `n ** 2`.**
