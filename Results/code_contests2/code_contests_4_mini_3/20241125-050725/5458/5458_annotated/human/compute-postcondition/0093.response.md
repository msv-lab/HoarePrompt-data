The code contains a `continue` statement, which indicates that the current iteration of a loop is to be skipped, and the loop moves on to the next iteration. The values of the variables `s`, `i`, `j`, `dp`, and `k` remain unchanged as the `continue` statement does not modify them.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is `m`, `dp` maintains its current state, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
