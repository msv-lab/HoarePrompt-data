Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the loop continues.***
