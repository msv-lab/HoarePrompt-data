The code snippet `continue` does not modify any variables directly; instead, it skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop. The values of `dp`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged, as the statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state remains as it was before the execution of the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`dp` is updated based on `i`, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3**
