Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the state remains as described in the precondition. Additionally, since `i` is not equal to 0 and `s` is at least 1, these conditions persist throughout the execution.**
