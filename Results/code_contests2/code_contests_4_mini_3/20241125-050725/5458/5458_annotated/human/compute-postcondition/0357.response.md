The `continue` statement does not change any variable values directly but skips the remaining code in the current loop iteration, moving to the next iteration. Based on the initial state, `dp` remains unchanged, and `k` has already been incremented by 1. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the continuation of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], `k` is now `k + 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
