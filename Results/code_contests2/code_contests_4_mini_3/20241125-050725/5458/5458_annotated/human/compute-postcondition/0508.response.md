Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, ensuring that the condition for `j` relative to `k` is satisfied, while maintaining all other variable constraints.***
