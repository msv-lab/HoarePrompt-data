According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we know `s` is at least 3, and `k` is currently 3. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented. Therefore, `k` must be adjusted to 4, and since `s` is at least 3, it must also be adjusted to ensure it is at least 4 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, and `k` is 4**
