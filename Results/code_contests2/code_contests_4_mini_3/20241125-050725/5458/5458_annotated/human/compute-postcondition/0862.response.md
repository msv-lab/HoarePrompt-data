According to the code, the outer loop executes `n ** 2` times. At the end of the last iteration, `i` remains `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the last iteration, it needs to be adjusted to `n + 1`. Additionally, since the loop condition is based on `i`, there is no need to adjust `n`. 

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to increment `i` by 1. 

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `dp` is unchanged**
