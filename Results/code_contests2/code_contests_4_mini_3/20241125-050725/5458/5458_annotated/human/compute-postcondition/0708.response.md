The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The specific values of `j` and `k` are relevant since they determine which elements of `dp` are being accessed and modified. The state of `dp` reflects a change based on these calculations. However, since the variables `j` and `k` are not provided with specific values, the output state will reflect the change in `dp` without precise numerical results.

Output State: **`dp` is updated based on the computation involving `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`**
