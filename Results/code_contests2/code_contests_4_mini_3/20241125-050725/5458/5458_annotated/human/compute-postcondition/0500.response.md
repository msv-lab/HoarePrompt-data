Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 3), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 2][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring that `i`, `j`, and `k` maintain their respective values throughout the execution, and `s` remains greater than or equal to 3.***
