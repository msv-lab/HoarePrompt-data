According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to 3. Therefore, `k` must be adjusted to 3, and since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, it does not need to be changed.

State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3**
