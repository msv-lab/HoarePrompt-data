Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros. If the loop executes, then for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. For `i` greater than 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to include contributions from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i][j][k - j]`. The loop will not execute if `s` is less than 1, which would result in `k` not having valid values to iterate over, leaving `dp` unchanged. If `n` is 0 or `m` is less than 1, the loop also does not execute, and `dp` remains as initialized.**
