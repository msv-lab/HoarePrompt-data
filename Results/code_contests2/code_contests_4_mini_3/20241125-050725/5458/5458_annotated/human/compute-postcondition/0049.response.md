The line of code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific values for `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but we know:

- `i` is greater than 0
- `j` is `m + 1`
- `k` is 1
- `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros.

Since the operation involves accessing a specific index of the 2D list `dp`, the values at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are both determined by the current state of the `dp` list. 

The assignment does not change other variables or the state of `dp` except for the specific index being modified. 

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**.
