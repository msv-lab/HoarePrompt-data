The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` updates a specific element in the `dp` array. The value of `i + 1 & 1` can be either `0` or `1`, depending on the value of `i`. Since `i` is greater than `0`, `i + 1` is at least `2`, and `i + 1 & 1` will yield `0`.

The variable `j` is `m` and is greater than `1`. Thus, `j + 1` will also be greater than `2`, so we can determine the indices for the `dp` array as follows:
- `dp[0][j + 1][k]`
- `dp[0][j][k]`

Therefore, the statement effectively copies the value from `dp[0][j][k]` to `dp[0][j + 1][k]`. The current state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `m` and greater than 1, `dp` maintains its current state, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[0][j][k]**
