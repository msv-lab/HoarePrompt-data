Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.***
