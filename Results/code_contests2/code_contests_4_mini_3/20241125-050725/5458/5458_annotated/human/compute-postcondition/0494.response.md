Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][m + 2][3]` to 1 if `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 3). The variable `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no update to `dp`.***
