According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. 

Since the loop is defined to iterate from 1 to `s + 1`, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 3 to allow `k` to take the value of 3. Thus, the state can be adjusted to indicate that `s` should be at least 3.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `k` is 3**
