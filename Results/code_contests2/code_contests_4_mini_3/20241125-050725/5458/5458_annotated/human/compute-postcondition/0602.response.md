Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made, and the loop will also continue.***
