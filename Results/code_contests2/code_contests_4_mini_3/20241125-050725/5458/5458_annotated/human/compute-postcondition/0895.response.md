According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `s + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `2` and `s` is at least `2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `3`. However, since `k` is currently `2`, and `s` is at least `2`, we need to ensure that `s` is at least `3` for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the adjustments needed are:
- `k` should be adjusted to `3`.
- `s` should be adjusted to at least `3`.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3.**
