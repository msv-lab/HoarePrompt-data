The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
