To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop statement.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `m` is at least 2
- `j` is 2
- `k` is between 1 and `s` (inclusive)

The loop statement is:
```
for k in xrange(1, s + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the variable `k` must be initialized to the starting value of the range defined in the loop, which is `1`. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to be `1` before the loop starts. 

Also, we need to ensure that `s` is at least `1` to ensure the range `(1, s + 1)` is valid, allowing the loop to run at least once. 

The current state of `k` indicates it is between `1` and `s`, which means it could potentially be `1` already, but we need to explicitly set it to `1` for the loop to start correctly.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- Set `k` to `1`
- Ensure `s` is at least `1`

Final state adjustment:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1**
