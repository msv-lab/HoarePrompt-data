According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, we need to check if `k` can take on the next value. 

The loop increments `k` for each iteration, starting from 1 up to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. We also need to ensure that the other states related to `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `s` remain valid.

Assuming `s` is at least 3, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `k` is now 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3**
