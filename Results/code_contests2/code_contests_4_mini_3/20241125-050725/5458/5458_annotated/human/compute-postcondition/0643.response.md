Output State: **If m is at least 1 and s is at least 1, then for each j from 1 to m and for each k from 1 to s, dp will be updated based on the conditions involving i, j, and k. Specifically, if i is 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be set to 1. If i is not 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If i is not 0 and j <= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be updated using dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and dp[i & 1][j][k - j], considering the modulus operation. If m is less than 1, j remains 1 and dp remains unchanged. If s is less than 1, k remains undefined, j is still 1, and dp remains unchanged. If i is 0, the updates to dp depend on the relationship between j and k, and if j equals k, the logic will also determine how dp is updated.**
