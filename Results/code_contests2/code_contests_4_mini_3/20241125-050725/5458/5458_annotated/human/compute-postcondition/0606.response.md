According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The loop can execute again if the current value of `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is equal to `s + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, we need to set `k` to `s`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `i` can be either 0 or not 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, which will be accurately reflected after adjusting `k`.

State: **`i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, and `k` is equal to `s`**
