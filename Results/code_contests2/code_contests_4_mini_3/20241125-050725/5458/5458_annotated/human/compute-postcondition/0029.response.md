Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2 (the value of `k`), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. All modifications are within the bounds defined by `m` and `s`, ensuring that `k` is always less than or equal to `s`.***
