The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Given that `i` is `0`, `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `k` is `1`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, we can deduce that:

- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1` since `i` is `0`. This means we are accessing the first row of the `dp` list.
- `j + 1` would give us the next index for `j` in the list.
- The value `1` is now stored in `dp[1][j + 1][1]`.

The values of `j`, `m`, and `s` are not specified, but they do not affect the assignment made to the `dp` list. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to the `dp` list.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1**
