According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `k` is at its maximum value of `s`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`, which is the next value that is not included in the range of the loop. Since `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, the state must reflect that `k` is now equal to `s + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted based on the provided conditions.

State: **`dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, `k` is equal to `s + 1`**
