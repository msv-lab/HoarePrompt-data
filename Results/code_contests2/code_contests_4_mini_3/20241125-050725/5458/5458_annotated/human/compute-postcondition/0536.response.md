Output State: **`s` is a positive integer, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, and `k` will take values from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the values from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, both taken modulo `mod`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `k` remains undefined, while `dp` values are unchanged. If `j` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `dp` values are unchanged.**
