Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. There is no change to `dp` when `j` is less than `k`, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged for that scenario.***
