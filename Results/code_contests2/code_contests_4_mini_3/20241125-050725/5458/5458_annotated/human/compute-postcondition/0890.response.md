The values of the variables do not change, but we continue with the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**
