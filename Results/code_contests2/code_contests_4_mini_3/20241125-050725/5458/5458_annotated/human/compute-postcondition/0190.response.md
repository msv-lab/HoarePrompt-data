Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][1]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. There are no changes to the state of `j`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `s`, or `i` outside of this condition.***
