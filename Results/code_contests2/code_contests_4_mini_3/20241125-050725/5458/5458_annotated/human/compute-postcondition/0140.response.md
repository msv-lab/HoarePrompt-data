Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then a value in `dp` is updated based on the current indices, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no updates to `dp` occur and the loop proceeds.***
