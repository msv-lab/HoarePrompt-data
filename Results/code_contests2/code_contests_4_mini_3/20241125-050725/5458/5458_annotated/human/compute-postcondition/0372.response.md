The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modifies the `dp` 2D list. The index `i + 1 & 1` computes the value based on `i`, which is greater than or equal to 1. The expression `j + 1` is within the bounds since `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1) and less than or equal to `m`. We are accessing the element at `k`, which is equal to 1.

The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `dp` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact values but can conclude that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will now replicate whatever is currently at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Thus, the output state is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`; `j` is greater than k (1) and less than or equal to `m`; `i` is greater than or equal to 1; `m` is unchanged; `s` is greater than or equal to 1; `k` is 1.**
