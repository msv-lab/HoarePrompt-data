The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but is used to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the indication that we skip to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
