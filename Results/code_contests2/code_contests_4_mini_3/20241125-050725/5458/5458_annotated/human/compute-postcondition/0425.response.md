The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` element updated, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` element updated, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
