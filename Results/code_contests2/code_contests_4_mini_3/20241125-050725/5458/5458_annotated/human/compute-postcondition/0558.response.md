The values of the variables do not change, but we continue with the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.
