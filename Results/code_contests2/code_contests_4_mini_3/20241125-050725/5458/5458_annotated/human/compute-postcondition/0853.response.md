The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
