Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the array `dp` is updated at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the array `dp` remains unchanged at that index.***
