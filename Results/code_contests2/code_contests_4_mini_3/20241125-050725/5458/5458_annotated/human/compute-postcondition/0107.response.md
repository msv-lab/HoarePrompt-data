According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`, which is currently 3. The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 3 and `k` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4. 

Therefore, `k` should be adjusted to 4, and `s` needs to remain at least 3 to ensure the loop can run again.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is `m`, and `k` is 4**
