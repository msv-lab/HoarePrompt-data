Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, taking modulo `mod`.***
