According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be at least 1 and less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time. 

Given that `k` is currently such that the loop has executed for the maximum value of `k` (which is `s`), for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be set to `s + 1`. 

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `k` to `s + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros, k is s + 1**
