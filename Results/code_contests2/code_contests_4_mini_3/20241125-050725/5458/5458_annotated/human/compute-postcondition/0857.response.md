Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and also includes an addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
