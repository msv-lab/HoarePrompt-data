Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1). If `i` is 0 and `j` is between 1 and `m`, and `k` is 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and also includes `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, with `k` being equal to 1.***
