Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros; `i` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 1; `k` is 1; `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues execution. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute any assignment within this block.***
