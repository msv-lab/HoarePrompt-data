The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value from one location in the 2D list `dp` to another. The variable `k` is incremented by 1, and its new value is now greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `s`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. 

The effect of this operation depends on the previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, but since these values are not specified, we can only express the output state in terms of the operations performed.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1); `k` is now `k + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
