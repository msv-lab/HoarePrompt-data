Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros if `s` is 0. If `s` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the computation involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures all relevant updates to `dp` are carried out based on the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and the relationship between them.***
