According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `m`. The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `m`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, we are not provided with the exact value of `j`, but we know that `j` must be less than or equal to `m` for the loop to have executed. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` would need to be incremented by 1, which means it must be equal to `m` at the end of the last iteration. Thus, the next state must indicate that `j` is now `m + 1`, which is outside the bounds of the loop.

Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of `j` to reflect that it has reached `m + 1`. 

State: **`s` is 0, `dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, `j` is m + 1**
