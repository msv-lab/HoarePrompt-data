According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` can take on the next value, which would be `k` equal to 2 in this case, since it starts at 1 and goes up to `s + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must remain at least 2 (to allow `k` to increment to 2) and `k` will be adjusted to 2.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, and `k` is 2.**
