Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is greater than 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, thus skipping any further processing in the current iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the variables or array.***
