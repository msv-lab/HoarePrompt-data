The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables in the current scope. Instead, it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `s`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.**
