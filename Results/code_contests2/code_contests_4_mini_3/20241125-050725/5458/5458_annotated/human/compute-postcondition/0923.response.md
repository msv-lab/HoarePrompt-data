The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional list `dp`. Here, the expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either `0` or `1` based on the least significant bit of `i + 1`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, we do not have the exact value for `n`, but we know `i` is at least `1`. 

The `&` operator computes the bitwise AND, so `i + 1 & 1` results in `0` if `i + 1` is even and `1` if `i + 1` is odd. 

The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are only used for indexing in this operation.

The output state reflects the unchanged values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s`, along with the evaluation of the expression used for indexing into `dp`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**.
