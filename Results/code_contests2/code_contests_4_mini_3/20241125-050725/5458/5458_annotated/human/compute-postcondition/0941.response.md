Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, leaving `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` unchanged, as it is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In the case where `j` is not greater than `k`, there are no changes made to the state. The overall state remains dependent on the values of `j` and `k`, and the program's execution continues accordingly.***
