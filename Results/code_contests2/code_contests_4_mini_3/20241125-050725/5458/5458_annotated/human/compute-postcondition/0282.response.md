Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The bounds and relationships of the involved variables are preserved throughout.***
