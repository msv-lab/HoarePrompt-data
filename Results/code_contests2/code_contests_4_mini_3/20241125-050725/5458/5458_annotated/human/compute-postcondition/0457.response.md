Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][m + 2], and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, while the conditions `k + 1 < n`, `m >= 1`, `j >= 1`, and `s >= 2` remain satisfied. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, thus maintaining the modular arithmetic condition and the integrity of the relationships among the values in `dp`. In all cases, the conditions on `k`, `m`, `j`, and `s` continue to hold true.***
