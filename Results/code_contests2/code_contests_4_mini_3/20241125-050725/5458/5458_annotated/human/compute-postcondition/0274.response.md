According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the variable `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

Since `k` is currently 2, for the loop to run again, `s` must be greater than or equal to 3 (because the loop will iterate as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`). Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `s` is at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 2**
