The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index in the 3D array `dp`. The indices involved are based on the expressions `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. 

Since `k` is given as `2`, we can focus on how `i` and `j` affect the indices. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will yield either `0` or `1` depending on the value of `i` (if `i` is `0`, it results in `1`; if `i` is `1`, it results in `0`). The index `j + 1` will simply increase `j` by `1`. 

However, without specific values for `i` and `j`, we cannot determine the exact indices being modified in `dp`. The 2D list `dp` is initialized with dimensions `[2][m + 2]`, so it can accommodate the indices being modified.

Thus, the output state reflects that the operation has taken place in the structure `dp` but does not specify the exact values of `i`, `j`, or the resulting state of `dp` without those specific inputs.

Output State: **`dp` is modified at indices determined by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k` (where `k` is 2), setting `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` to 1.**
