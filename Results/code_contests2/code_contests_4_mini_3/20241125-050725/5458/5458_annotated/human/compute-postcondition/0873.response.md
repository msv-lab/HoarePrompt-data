Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the state remains as described in the precondition. Additionally, since `i` is not equal to 0 and `s` is at least 1, these conditions persist throughout the execution.***
