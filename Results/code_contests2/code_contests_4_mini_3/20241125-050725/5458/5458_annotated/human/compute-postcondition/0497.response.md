Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the state of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`.***
