According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` from 1 to `s`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to take on the next value in the range. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its last value of `s`, since the loop runs while `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

To allow for one more execution of the loop, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`, which is the next value after the last valid index. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` changing to `s + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros, k is s + 1**
