Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros if `s` is 0; if `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is updated based on values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the remaining code in the current iteration is skipped. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no update to `dp`, and the program proceeds to execute the subsequent code in the loop iteration.***
