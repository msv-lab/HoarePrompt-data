Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs, `n`, `m`, and `s`, from user input and processes them until all three inputs are zero. For each set of inputs, it uses dynamic programming to compute a value based on the relationships defined in the nested loops and stores the results in a 3D list `dp`. Finally, it prints the computed value `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s]` modulo `100000`. It operates under the constraints that `n` is between 1 and 7, `m` is between 1 and 2000, and `s` is between 1 and 3000. If the inputs are all zero, the function terminates.**
