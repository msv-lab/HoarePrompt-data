Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then an element in the `dp` array at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged with respect to the `dp` array.***
