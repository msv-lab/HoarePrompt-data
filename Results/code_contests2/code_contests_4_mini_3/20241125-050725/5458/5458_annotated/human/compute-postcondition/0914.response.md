The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modifies the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes the least significant bit of `i + 1`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, `i + 1` will be `n + 2`. The least significant bit of any even number (like `n + 2` if `n` is even) is 0, and for odd, it is 1.

The value `j + 1` indicates that we are accessing the next index for `j` in the `dp` array, and `k` remains unchanged.

The assignment does not affect the value of `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, or `s`, so the output state will reflect the unchanged variables with the operation being performed.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
