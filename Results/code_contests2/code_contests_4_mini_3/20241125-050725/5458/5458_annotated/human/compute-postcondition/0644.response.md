To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration and the for loop statement provided.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as `for i in xrange(n ** 2)`, meaning that `i` will take values from `0` to `n^2 - 1`. 

2. **Current State**: The state indicates that `m` is at least 1 and `s` is at least 1, which means the loop logic will depend on the value of `i` and how it interacts with `m` and `s`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` must be `n^2 - 1` for the loop to be able to execute one more time.
   - For the loop to execute once again, `i` must be less than `n^2`. Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1.

4. **Adjusting State**: Since `i` must be less than `n^2` for the loop to continue executing, we need to adjust it so that it will be `i = n^2`. No other states are impacted directly by the loop iteration.

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is n^2**
