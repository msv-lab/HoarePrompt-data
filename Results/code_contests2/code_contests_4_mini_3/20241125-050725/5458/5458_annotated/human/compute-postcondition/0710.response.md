According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its current value, which is the value from the previous iteration. Since the loop iterates over `k` starting from 1 and going up to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `k` is now 2 (if it was 1 in the last iteration), and ensure that `s` is at least 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2**
