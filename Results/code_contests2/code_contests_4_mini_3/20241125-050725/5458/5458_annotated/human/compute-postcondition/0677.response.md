The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` updates the value at a specific index of the list `dp`. The value of `k` is `s + 1`, which is provided in the initial state. The specific values of `i` and `j` are not mentioned, so they remain unknown but are used in the indexing. The rest of the structure of `dp` remains unchanged.

The output state reflects that the value at the specified index is set to 1, while the overall structure of `dp` and the values of `i` and `j` are not altered.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros; `k` is s + 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
