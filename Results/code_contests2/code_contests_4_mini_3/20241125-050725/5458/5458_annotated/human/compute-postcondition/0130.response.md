The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, the output state reflects that no changes occur to these variables. Therefore, the output state is that the variables maintain their previous values and that we skip to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration.**
