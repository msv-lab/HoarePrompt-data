According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` remains unchanged if `k` is equal to `s` because the loop's condition will not allow `k` to exceed `s + 1`. 

Since the state indicates that `k` must be incremented for the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `k` to `k + 1`. This means that the current value of `k` must be less than `s` for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that `k` is adjusted appropriately. The state related to `k` should be modified to reflect the next iteration.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros, k is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to s**
