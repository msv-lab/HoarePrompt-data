According to the code, the loop will execute for `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be adjusted to 3, and `s` needs to be at least 3 to ensure that the loop can continue. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3**
