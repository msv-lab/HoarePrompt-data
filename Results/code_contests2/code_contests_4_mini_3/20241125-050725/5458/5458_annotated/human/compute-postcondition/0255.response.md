The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the value at a specific index of the multidimensional array `dp`. 

Here's the breakdown:
- `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. The bitwise operation `1 & 1` results in 1.
- `j` is 2, so `j + 1` equals 3.
- `k` is 1, which remains unchanged.

Thus, the expression modifies `dp[1][3][1]` to 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and the previous values of `dp`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1**.
