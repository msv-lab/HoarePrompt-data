Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2]. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than 2, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][2]`, while if `j` is less than or equal to 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][2]` and adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][0]` to it, maintaining the conditions that `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is 2.***
