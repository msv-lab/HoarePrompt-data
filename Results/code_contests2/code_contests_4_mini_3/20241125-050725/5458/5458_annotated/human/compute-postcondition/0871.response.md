The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp` are mentioned in the initial state, where `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is unchanged, `dp` is unchanged, `s` is at least 1, and importantly, `i` is not equal to 0.

The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates as follows:
- `i + 1` will be at least `n + 2` (since `n + 1` is at least 1).
- The result of `i + 1 & 1` will yield either 0 or 1, depending on the parity of `i + 1`.

The value of `dp` at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` will be copied to `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific values and structure of `dp` are not defined in the initial state, but it is clear that the two mentioned indices in the `dp` array will be updated based on this assignment.

Since the assignment does not change any values of `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `dp`, or `s` directly (it only modifies the `dp` structure), the output state should reflect that the array `dp` has been updated but does not provide specific values, as they were not defined.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is unchanged, `dp` is updated, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0**.
