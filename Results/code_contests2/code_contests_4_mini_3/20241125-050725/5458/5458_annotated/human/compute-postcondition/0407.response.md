The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop, but it does not change the values of any variables. The variables `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` retain their values, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state reflects that there are no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
