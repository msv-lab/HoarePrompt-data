According to the for loop statement, the loop iterates over the range from `1` to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we need to determine the value of `j`. Since it is specified that the loop starts with `j` at `1` and iterates up to `m + 1`, the last value of `j` before exiting the loop would be `m`. Therefore, to allow for one more iteration, `j` should be incremented to `m + 1`.

Since `s` is greater than or equal to `1`, it doesn't affect the loop execution, and we do not need to adjust any other states. 

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `j` is now `m + 1`.

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to `1`, `j` is `m + 1`**
