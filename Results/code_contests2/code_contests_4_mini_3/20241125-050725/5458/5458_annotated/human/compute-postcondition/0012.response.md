Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros; if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1, while `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
