Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1), then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds accordingly.***
