Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by copying the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
