According to the code, the `while 1:` loop is an infinite loop, meaning it will execute indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to modify any states for the loop to execute one more time, as it is guaranteed to continue executing.

State: **`dp` will be updated based on the relationships defined, and it will remain unchanged if any of the conditions for loop execution are not met; the output is `dp[n`**
