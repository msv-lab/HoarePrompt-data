According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is currently 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `k` should be 4. Additionally, since the loop runs as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `s` must be at least 4 to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 4**
