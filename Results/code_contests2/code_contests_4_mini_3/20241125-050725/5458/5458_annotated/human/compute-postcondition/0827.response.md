According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1 since `xrange(1, s + 1)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to and including `s`. Given that `k` is initially set to `s`, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute, and at the beginning of the first iteration, `k` will be set to 1, the first value in the range.

To summarize:
- `s` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.
- `k` is now 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
