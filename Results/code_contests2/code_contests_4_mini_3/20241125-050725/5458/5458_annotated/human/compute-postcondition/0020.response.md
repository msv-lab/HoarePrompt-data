Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` when `j` is greater than `k`, or by adding both `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` when `j` is less than or equal to `k`. In all cases, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1.***
