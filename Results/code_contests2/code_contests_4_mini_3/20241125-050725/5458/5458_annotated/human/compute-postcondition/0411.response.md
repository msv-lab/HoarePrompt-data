Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2]. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged for that iteration. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is further incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` where `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. This means that the values in `dp` are updated based on the conditions applied to `i`, `j`, and `k`, particularly focusing on the relationships between these variables and their values.***
