Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][m + 2]. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1 while `k` remains 3 and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][3]`, maintaining the values of `k` and `s`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][3]` modulo `mod`, and it is then increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. In all cases, if conditions are not satisfied, the values in `dp`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
