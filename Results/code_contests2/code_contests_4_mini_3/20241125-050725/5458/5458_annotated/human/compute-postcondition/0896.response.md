Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 1. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include both `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Thus, the final state of `dp` reflects the outcomes based on these conditions.**
