Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1` (and thus greater than 0), `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least `m` and greater than `k`, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues; otherwise, there is no change in the state as there is no else part.***
