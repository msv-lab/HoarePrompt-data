According to the code, the loop will execute if `j` can take on a value greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m`, which means the loop has reached its upper limit. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `m + 1`, and since the loop is defined to run from 1 to `m + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 (which it is, as stated). Therefore, no changes to `m` are needed.

Since `j` is currently equal to `m`, to allow for one more iteration, we adjust `j` to be `m + 1`. 

State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
