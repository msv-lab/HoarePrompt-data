According to the code, the loop iterates `n ** 2` times, which means it will execute as long as `n` is a non-negative integer. The variable `i` will start at 0 and will take values from 0 up to `n ** 2 - 1` during the loop's execution. 

The given state indicates that `dp` is initialized as a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, which does not impact whether the loop can execute. 

For the loop to execute:
1. `n` must be a non-negative integer for `n ** 2` to be valid.
2. The initial value of `i` before the loop starts is 0.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are that `n` is a non-negative integer and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`dp` is a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0**
