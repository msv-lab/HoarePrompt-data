The code assigns a value of `1` to the `dp` array at the position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known as follows: `i` is `n`, `j` is `m`, and `k` is `3`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will effectively evaluate to `1` if `i` is odd and `0` if `i` is even, though specific values of `n` are not provided. The state of other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is 3, and a value of `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is 3, and a value of `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]**
