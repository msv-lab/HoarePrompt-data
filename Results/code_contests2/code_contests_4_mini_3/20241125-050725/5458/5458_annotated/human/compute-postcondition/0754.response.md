Output State: **If `s` is at least 1, then after the loop executes `s` times, `k` will be at least 1 and up to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is greater than 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `s` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, with `k` not being modified.**
