The `continue` statement does not change any variable values, but it skips the rest of the current iteration in the loop where it is placed. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes have occurred in the variable values, but we acknowledge that we skip to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`; `i` is unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
