Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is set to 1. There is no change to the state of `dp` if `j` is less than `k`.***
