Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, encompassing all relevant cases and ensuring that all index accesses remain within valid bounds.***
