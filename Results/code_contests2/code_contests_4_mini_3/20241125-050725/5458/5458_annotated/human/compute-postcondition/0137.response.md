Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.***
