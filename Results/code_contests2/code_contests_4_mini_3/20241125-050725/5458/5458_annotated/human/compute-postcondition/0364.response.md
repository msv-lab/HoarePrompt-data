According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `m`. The loop will execute for `j` in the range from 1 to `m` (inclusive). If `j` is currently at a value less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at a value that is less than `m`, which allows for one more iteration. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since the loop starts with `j` at 1 and goes up to `m`, after the last iteration, `j` must be adjusted to `j + 1`, which must now be less than or equal to `m`. No other states need to be modified.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1), j is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to m, i is unchanged, m is unchanged, s is unchanged**
