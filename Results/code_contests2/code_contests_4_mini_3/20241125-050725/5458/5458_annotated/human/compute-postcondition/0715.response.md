Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the nearest loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes to `dp` occur, and the control flow proceeds without executing the assignment or the continue statement.***
