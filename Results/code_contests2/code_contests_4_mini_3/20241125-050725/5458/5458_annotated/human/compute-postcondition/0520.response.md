The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `s`, `j`, `m`, and `k` are not directly changed by this operation, but they influence the indices used in the array. The value of `j` is at least 2, so `j + 1` is at least 3. The value of `k` is 2, and `m` is at least `j`, ensuring that the indices are within valid bounds.

Since the actual values in `dp` are not specified, we cannot determine the specific content of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` or `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, but we know that the latter is being assigned the value of the former.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2 (now at least 3 after incrementation), `m` is at least `j`, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
