Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In the remaining case where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This covers all scenarios of the variables with respect to their relationships and values after the execution of the program fragment.***
