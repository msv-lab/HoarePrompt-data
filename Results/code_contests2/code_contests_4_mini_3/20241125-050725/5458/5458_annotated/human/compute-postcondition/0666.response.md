Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is also updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All updates respect the boundaries of `j`, `k`, and the dimensions of `dp`.***
