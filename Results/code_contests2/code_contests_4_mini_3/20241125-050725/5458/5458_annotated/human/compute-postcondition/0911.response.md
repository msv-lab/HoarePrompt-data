According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the next iteration, the state of `k` should be 2.

Since `s` is at least 1, it can accommodate this increment, thus ensuring that the loop can run again.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 1**
