According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`, which means `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Given that `i` is `k + 1` and `n` is such that `k + 1 < n`, we don't need to adjust `i` or `n` for the loop to execute, but we do need to ensure that `m` is at least 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` should start at 1 (the first value in the range).

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][m + 2], `i` is k + 1, `n` is such that k + 1 < n, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
