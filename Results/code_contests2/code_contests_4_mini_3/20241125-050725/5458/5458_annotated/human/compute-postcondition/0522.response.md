Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is equal to or less than `k`, the execution of the program continues without any modifications to `dp` or any change in the state.**
