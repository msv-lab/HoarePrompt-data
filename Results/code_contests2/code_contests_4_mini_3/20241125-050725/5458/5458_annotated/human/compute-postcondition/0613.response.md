Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `dp` is modified at index [1][j + 1][1] and set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The values of `k` is 1, `i` is 0, and `dp` remains unchanged if `j` is less than `k`, which is not applicable in this case since `j` is equal to 3.***
