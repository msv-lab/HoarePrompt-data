The statement modifies the `dp` array at the index `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The original value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged until this operation is executed.

Given that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is 0, the operation will add the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The state of `dp` is modified based on the calculation involving `k - j`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the changes in `dp` based on the operation performed.

Output State: **`dp` is modified at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, with the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**.
