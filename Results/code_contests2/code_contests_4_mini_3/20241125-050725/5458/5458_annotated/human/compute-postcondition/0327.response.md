Postcondition: ***`dp` will be updated based on the relationships defined, and `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values based on input. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If any of `n`, `m`, or `s` is not equal to 0, the program continues executing without breaking.***
