The code `continue` indicates that the program will skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The variables' values remain unchanged, but we acknowledge that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
