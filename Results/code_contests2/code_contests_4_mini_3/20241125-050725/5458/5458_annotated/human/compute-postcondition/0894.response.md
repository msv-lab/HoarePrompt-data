Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. This encompasses all conditions and updates to the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
