The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and there is no specific output or return value from this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing the loop without any changes to the variable states.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `i` is 2, `n` is such that `k + 1 < n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
