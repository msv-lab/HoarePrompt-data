The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with the value from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]; `i`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s` are unchanged; `k` is greater than `s`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
