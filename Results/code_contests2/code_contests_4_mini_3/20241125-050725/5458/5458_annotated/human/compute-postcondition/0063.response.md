Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is equal to `s + 1`), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on a modulo operation involving previous values from `dp`. The overall state of `dp` reflects these updates, ensuring proper handling of all possible values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
