The code assigns the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i + 1 & 1` will be dependent on whether `i` is 0 or greater than 0. If `i` is 0, then `i + 1` is 1, and `1 & 1` results in 1. If `i` is greater than 0, `i + 1` will be at least 2, and `2 & 1` results in 0. Therefore, the output state will reflect two possible scenarios based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2; and the value of `dp` at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` based on the value of `i`.**
