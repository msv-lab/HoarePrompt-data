Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2] where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1). If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues without further actions. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the loop may proceed to the next iteration accordingly. The conditions ensure that `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1.***
