According to the code, the loop will iterate over `k` from 1 to `s`, meaning that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to iterate again, `s` must be at least 2 because `k` should be less than or equal to `s`. 

Given that `s` is greater than 0, we can adjust it to be greater than or equal to 2, ensuring that `k` can be incremented to 3 in the next iteration. Therefore, the states to be adjusted are `s` and `k`.

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 3**
