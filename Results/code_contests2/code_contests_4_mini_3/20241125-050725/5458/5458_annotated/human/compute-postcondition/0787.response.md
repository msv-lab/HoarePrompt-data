Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is n, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the `dp` array.**
