According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` can take on another value within the specified range. The loop starts at 1 and goes up to `m`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is greater than or equal to 2 and `m` is greater than or equal to `j`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented and must be less than `m`. 

Since `j` is currently some value greater than or equal to 2, to execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is equal to `m` in the next state to allow the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, and `k` will take values from 1 to `s`.**
