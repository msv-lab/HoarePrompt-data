The `continue` statement is executed, which causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables before and after this statement remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values of the variables remain the same, and we have continued to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
