The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the element of a 3-dimensional list (or array) `dp`. The index calculations involve the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The value of `i` is `n + 1`, so `i + 1` is `n + 2`.
2. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes the bitwise AND operation between `i + 1` and `1`. This results in either `0` or `1`, depending on whether `n + 2` is even or odd.
3. The value of `j + 1` increases `j` by `1`, but we don't know its specific value other than it being at least `1`.
4. The value of `k` remains unchanged.

The output state will reflect the changes made by this operation on the `dp` array, but since we do not have the specific values for `n`, `j`, and `k`, we cannot provide concrete values for the indices. 

Thus, the output state will indicate what is known about the variables and the action taken:

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is unchanged, `s` is at least 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
