Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to match `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp` and the current iteration proceeds without modifications. This ensures that all values of `dp` remain consistent based on the condition of `j` relative to `k`.***
