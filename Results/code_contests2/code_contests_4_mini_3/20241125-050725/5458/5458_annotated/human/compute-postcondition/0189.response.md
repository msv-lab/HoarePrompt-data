The values of the variables do not change, but we continue with the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][1]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]`, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][1]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]`, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**
