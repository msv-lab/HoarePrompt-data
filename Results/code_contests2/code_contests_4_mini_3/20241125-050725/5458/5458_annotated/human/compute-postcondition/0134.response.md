Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, ensuring that the value is computed modulo `mod`.***
