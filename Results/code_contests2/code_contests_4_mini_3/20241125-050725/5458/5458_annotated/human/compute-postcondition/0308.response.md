According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 2, and since `k` is iterating from 1 up to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2. Therefore, the state must reflect that `k` is now 2 and `s` remains at least 2.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `k` is 2**
