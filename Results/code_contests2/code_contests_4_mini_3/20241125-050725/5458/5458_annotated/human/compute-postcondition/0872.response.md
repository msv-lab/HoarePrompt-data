The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this command, but it indicates that we are moving on to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is unchanged, `dp` is updated, `s` is at least 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is unchanged, `dp` is updated, `s` is at least 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
