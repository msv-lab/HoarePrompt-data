According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will iterate for values of `j` ranging from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `dp` is initialized as a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be incremented from its last value in the previous iteration. If `j` was at its maximum value of `m`, the loop cannot execute again because it would exceed the upper limit. 

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `m`. If `j` was at `m` in the last iteration, it should be adjusted to `m + 1` to indicate that we are ready to start the next iteration. However, since the loop conditions allow for valid values from 1 to `m`, we will keep the loop valid by ensuring `j` is adjusted to `m + 1`, and `m` should be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`**
