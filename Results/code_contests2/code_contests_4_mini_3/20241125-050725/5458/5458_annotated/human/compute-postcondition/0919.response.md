Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
