According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates a total of `n ** 2` times, where `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n ** 2 - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `i` would have reached `n ** 2 - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n ** 2`. Additionally, since `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute in the first place, this condition must still hold. 

No other states need to be adjusted because the other variables (`m`, `s`, and any related conditions in the loop body) are not relevant to the execution of the outer loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n ** 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
