The code executes a `continue` statement, which does not change the values of the variables but skips the current iteration of a loop. The values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, `k`, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, `k`, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
