To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop conditions and the states provided.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `j` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `s` is greater than or equal to 3
   - `k` is currently 3

3. **Next Execution of the Loop**: The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since `k` is currently 3, we need to ensure `k` is incremented for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be adjusted to 4.

4. **Adjusting `s`**: Since `k` (now 4) must be less than or equal to `s`, `s` must be adjusted to be at least 4 to satisfy the loop condition.

Thus, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect these changes.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is 4**
