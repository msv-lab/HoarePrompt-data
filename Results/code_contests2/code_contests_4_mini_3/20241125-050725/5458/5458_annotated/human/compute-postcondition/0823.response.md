Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and additionally includes `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The function handles cases where `j` is exactly equal to 3 and ensures that `dp` is modified appropriately when `m` is greater than 2. If `m` is less than or equal to 2, `dp` remains unchanged.***
