According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 1 to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented, which means that `j` should be equal to `m` at the end of the previous iteration to allow the next iteration to be `j = m + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is at least 1. Since `j` is at least 1, it can be incremented in the next iteration as long as it is less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is equal to `m`, which will allow `j` to reach `m + 1` in the next iteration.

Thus, we adjust the state as follows:
- `j` should be set to `m` to allow for the next increment to `m + 1`.

Since `i`, `m`, and `k` do not need adjustments for the loop to execute again, the final state must reflect the incremented `j`.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is at least 1**
