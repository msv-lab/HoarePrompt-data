Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds accordingly.***
