The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index of a multi-dimensional array `dp`. 

1. The value of `i` is `0`. Therefore, `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`. So the first index of `dp` is `1`.
2. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to `2`. Thus, when `j + 1` is computed, it will be at least `3`. Therefore, the second index of `dp` will be at least `3`.
3. The value of `k` remains `1` as per the initial state.

Therefore, the assignment modifies the value at `dp[1][j + 1][1]` to `1`, and the states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1**.
