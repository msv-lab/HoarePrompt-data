Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no change to the state of `dp` and the next iteration proceeds without this update.***
