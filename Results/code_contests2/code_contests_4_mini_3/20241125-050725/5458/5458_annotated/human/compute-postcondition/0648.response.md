The line of code assigns values to `n`, `m`, and `s` by using the `map` function to convert the input received from `raw_input()` into integers. The initial state of `dp` is not altered, but `n`, `m`, and `s` are now initialized with the values from the input. Since these values can be any integers based on the user input, the output state will reflect the current state of the variables.

Output State: **`dp` contains values based on dynamic programming relations; `n`, `m`, `s` are input integers**
