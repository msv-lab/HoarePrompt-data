Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, we copy the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made, and the execution proceeds to the next part of the program.***
