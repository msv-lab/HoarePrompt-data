The `continue` statement is executed, which causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as before the execution of the `continue`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `dp` remains unchanged, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
