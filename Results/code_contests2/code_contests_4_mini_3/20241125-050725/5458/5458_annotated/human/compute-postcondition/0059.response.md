The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but skips the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros; `k` is equal to `s + 1; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] which is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
