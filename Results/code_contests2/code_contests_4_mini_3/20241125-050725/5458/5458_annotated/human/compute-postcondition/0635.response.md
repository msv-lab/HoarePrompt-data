The values of the variables do not change due to the `continue` statement, but it causes the loop to skip the remaining statements for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
