The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop that we are directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
