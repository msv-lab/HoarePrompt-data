Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, the values of `dp` are modified according to the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
