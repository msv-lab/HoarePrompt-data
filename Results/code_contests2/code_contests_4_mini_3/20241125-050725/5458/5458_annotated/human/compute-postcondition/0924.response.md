The code `continue` causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged; therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
