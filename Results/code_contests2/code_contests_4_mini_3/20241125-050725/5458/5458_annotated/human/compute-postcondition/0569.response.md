Output State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`; if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged.**
