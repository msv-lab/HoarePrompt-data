Postcondition: ***`s` is at least `1`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `m`, `dp` maintains its current state, and `k` is `1`. If `i` is `0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`. If `j` is less than `1`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than `0` and `j` is greater than `1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and if `j` is less than or equal to `1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The values of `dp` are adjusted based on the conditions, taking into account the boundaries of `j` and the current states of `i` and `k`.***
