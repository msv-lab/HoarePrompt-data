Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, while ensuring all updates respect the modulo operation.***
