Output State: **`s` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is at least 1. After the loop executes, for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`, if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and also includes the contribution from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` under modulo conditions. If `s` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and all values in `dp` remain unchanged.**
