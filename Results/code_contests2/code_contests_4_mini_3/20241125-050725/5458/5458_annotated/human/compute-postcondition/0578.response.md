The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional array `dp`. Here, `i` is 0, `j` is 2 or greater, and `k` is 1. 

1. The calculation `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `(0 + 1) & 1` which is `1 & 1`, resulting in `1`.
2. The value of `j + 1` is at least `3` since `j` is `2` or greater.
3. `k` remains `1`.

Thus, the assignment sets `dp[1][j + 1][1]` to `1`. The variables `s`, `m`, and `dp` remain unchanged in value.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 2 or greater, and `dp` remains unchanged, but now we also note that `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to `1`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 2 or greater, `dp` remains unchanged, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1**
