Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros if `s` is 0. If `s` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the computation involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In summary, when `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, and if `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged, ensuring all edge cases concerning the relations between `j`, `k`, and `i` are accounted for.***
