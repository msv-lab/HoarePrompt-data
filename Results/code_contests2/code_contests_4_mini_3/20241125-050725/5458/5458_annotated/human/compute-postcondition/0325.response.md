The line of code assigns values to `n`, `m`, and `s` by mapping the integers from the input string split into three components. Since the initial state does not specify the input, `n`, `m`, and `s` will be assigned values based on the input provided during execution. The state of `dp` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, we note the initial conditions and the new assignments.

Output State: **`dp` will be updated based on the relationships defined, `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values based on input**
