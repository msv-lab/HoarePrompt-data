According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1), `k` is 3**
