Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][m + 2], and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, while the conditions `k + 1 < n`, `m >= 1`, `j >= 1`, and `s >= 2` remain satisfied. If `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
