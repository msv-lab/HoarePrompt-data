According to the code, the outer loop will execute for each `i` from 0 to `n^2 - 1`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n^2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has reached a certain value, and if we want the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Since the provided state indicates that `i` has not reached `n^2` yet, we need to increment `i` to indicate that it will be `i + 1` in the next iteration. 

Thus, if we denote the current value of `i` at the end of the last iteration as `current_i`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `current_i` is less than `n^2` and increment `i` accordingly.

State: **`i` is `current_i + 1`, where `current_i` is less than `n^2`**
