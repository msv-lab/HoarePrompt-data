The code contains the statement `continue`, which causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop. This does not change any variable states, but it indicates that the loop continues to the next iteration. The values of `s`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is greater than 0, `i` is `n` and not equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
