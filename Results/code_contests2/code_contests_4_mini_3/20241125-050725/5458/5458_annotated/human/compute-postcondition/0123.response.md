Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to match `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`, otherwise no changes are made to `dp`.**
