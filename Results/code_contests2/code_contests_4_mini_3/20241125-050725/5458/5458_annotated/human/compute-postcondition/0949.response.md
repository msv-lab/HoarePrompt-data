The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement is executed, which skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2]`.
