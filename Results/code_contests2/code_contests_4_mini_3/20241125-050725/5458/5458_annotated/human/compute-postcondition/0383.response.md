Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1). If `j` is greater than `k` (which is 2), the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, reflecting the state of `dp` before this assignment. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
