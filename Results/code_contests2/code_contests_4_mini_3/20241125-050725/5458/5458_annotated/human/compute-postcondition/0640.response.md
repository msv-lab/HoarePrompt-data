To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop and the current state. 

The loop statement is `for k in xrange(1, s + 1):`, which means that `k` will take on values starting from 1 up to `s`. 

Currently, we have the following state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is at least 3
- `m` is at least 3
- `j` is 3
- `k` is 3

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must become 4, since the loop continues as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Given that `s` is at least 3, it needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is at least 4 to allow the loop to continue.

Thus, the only states that need to be adjusted to allow the loop to execute one more time are:
- `k` should be adjusted to 4.
- `s` should be adjusted to be at least 4.

No changes to `m` or `j` are needed as they do not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 4**
