The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the rest of the loop body and continue with the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes have been made to the variables, but we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is modified based on previous values, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
