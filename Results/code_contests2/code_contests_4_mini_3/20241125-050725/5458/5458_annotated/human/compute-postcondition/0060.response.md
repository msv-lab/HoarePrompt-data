Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, which is zero, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the current state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
