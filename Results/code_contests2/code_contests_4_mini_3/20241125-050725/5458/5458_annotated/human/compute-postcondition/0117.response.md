Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. There are no changes made to the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, or `k` if `j` is less than `k`.***
