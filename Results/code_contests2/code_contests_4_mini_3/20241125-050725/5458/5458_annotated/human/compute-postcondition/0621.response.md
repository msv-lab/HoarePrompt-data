Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and `dp` is modified at index `[1][j + 1][k]` (which corresponds to `[1][4][1]`) and set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and also incorporates `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The value of `dp` at various indices may have changed based on these conditions. The program maintains the condition that `dp` remains unchanged outside these specified updates.***
