Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp` remains unchanged except for the update at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the state of all variables remains the same.***
