According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`, which iterates from `1` to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 2 (the next value in the range).

No other states need to be adjusted since `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `s` do not directly affect the loop execution in the context of the range defined for `k`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2.**
