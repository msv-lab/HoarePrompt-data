Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the iteration continues normally.***
