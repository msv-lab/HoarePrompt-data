Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `dp` remains unchanged, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, ensuring that the state of `dp` related to the specified indices reflects this assignment while the rest of `dp` remains unchanged. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no change in the program state.***
