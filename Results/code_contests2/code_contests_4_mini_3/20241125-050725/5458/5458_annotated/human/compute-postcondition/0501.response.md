According to the code, the loop can execute if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `k` must be equal to `s` for the loop to exit. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to `s + 1`. Additionally, since `s` must remain greater than or equal to 3, we do not change `s`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `k` should be adjusted to `s + 1`.

No other states need to be modified as `i`, `j`, and `s` are not directly affected by the loop incrementing `k`.

State: **`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is `s + 1`**.
