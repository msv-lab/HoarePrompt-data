According to the code, the `for` loop will execute as long as `k` is in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `2`, and `s` is greater than or equal to `2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented, which means it needs to be `3`. Additionally, `s` must be at least `3` to ensure that the loop can run with `k` set to `3`.

So the adjusted states are:
- `k` becomes `3`.
- `s` needs to be greater than or equal to `3`.

State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3.**
