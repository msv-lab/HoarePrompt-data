Postcondition: ***If `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is `n + 1` and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `dp`, specifically it is computed as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The relationships between the variables and their respective indices are maintained throughout these operations.***
