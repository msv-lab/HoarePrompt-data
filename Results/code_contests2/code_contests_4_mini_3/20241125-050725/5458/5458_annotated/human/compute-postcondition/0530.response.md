The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop without executing the remaining code in the current iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
