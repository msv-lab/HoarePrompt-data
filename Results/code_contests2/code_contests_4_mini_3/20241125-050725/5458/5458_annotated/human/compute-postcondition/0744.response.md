According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from 1 to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented. After the last iteration, `k` is 2, meaning the next value of `k` should be 3. Since `k` must be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 3. 

No other states need to be adjusted as the other variables (`i`, `j`, and `dp`) are not relevant for determining whether the loop can execute again.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `k` is 3**
