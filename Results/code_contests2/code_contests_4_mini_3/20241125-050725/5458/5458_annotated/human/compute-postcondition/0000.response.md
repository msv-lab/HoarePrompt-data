The value of `mod` is assigned the constant value `100000`. This assignment does not affect the values of `N`, `M`, and `S`, which remain within their specified ranges. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000, and `mod` is 100000.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000, and `mod` is 100000**
