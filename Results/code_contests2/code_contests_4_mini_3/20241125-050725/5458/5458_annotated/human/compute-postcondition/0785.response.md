The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, while the values of the variables remain unchanged, the execution flow of the program is affected as it will not proceed with the remaining code in the current iteration. 

The output state remains the same regarding the values of the variables. Thus, the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
