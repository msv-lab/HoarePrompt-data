According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` in relation to `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is unchanged, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted to `k + 1`, which means we need to ensure `k` is at least 2 (it will become 2 in the next iteration) since `s` is at least 2.

Thus, we need to adjust `k` to 2. 

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2**
