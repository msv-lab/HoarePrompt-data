To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop's parameters and the conditions provided.

1. The loop iterates over `k` starting from 1 up to `s`, inclusive. For the loop to execute again, the value of `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 
2. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s`. Thus, in order for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented to `s + 1`, which is not within the range defined by the loop.
3. Therefore, `s` must be increased by at least 1 for the loop to be able to execute again.

Taking into account these points, we can adjust the states accordingly.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], s is greater than or equal to 2.**
