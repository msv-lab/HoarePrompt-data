Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then no assignment occurs to `dp`. If `i` is `n` and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This covers all cases, including the edge cases where `j` is equal to `k` and the variations in values of `j` in relation to `k`.***
