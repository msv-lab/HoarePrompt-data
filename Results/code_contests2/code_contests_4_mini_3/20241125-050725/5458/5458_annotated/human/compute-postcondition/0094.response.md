Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is `m`, `dp` maintains its current state, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the if statement, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
