The code snippet updates a multidimensional array `dp` based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The specific value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

- The variable `i` is `n`, but its specific value is not provided.
- The variable `j` is `m + 1`, where `m` is greater than or equal to 1, so `j` is at least 2.
- The variable `k` is 2.

Since the specific values of the array `dp` and `n` are not given, we cannot determine the exact change in `dp`. However, we know that the assignment is based on the values derived from `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the assignment is made, but without exact values for `dp` or `n`. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
