According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for `j` starting from 1 to `m`, which means `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to have any iterations. The current state shows that `i` is 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop. 

For the loop to be executed, `m` needs to be greater than 0, and `j` should start at 1 for the first iteration. Therefore, we can summarize the necessary adjustments in the state.

State: **`dp` is a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
