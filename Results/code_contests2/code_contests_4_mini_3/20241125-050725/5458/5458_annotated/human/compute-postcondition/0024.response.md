The expression `i + 1 & 1` will yield either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. Since `dp` is a 2D list, the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updating one of its elements based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but we know that `k` is 2. Therefore, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` will be set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][2]`. 

Since the previous state of `dp` has not changed other than this assignment, we can summarize the output state. The output state will reflect that one element of the `dp` array has been updated based on the previous value.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][2]`**
