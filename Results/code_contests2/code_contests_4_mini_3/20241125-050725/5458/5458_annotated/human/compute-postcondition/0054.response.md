Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is equal to `m + 1` (which is greater than or equal to `k`), then `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod` and adding it to the previous value. In all cases, the values of `dp` reflect the updates based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
