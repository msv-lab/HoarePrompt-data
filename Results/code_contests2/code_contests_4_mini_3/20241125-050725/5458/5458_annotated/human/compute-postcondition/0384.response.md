Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1); if `j` is greater than `k` (which is 2), `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, reflecting the state of `dp` after this assignment; if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`.**
