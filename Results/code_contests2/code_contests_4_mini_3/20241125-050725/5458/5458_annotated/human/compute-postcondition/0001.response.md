The code assigns values to `n`, `m`, and `s` by taking input from the user and mapping it to integers. The initial state specifies that `N`, `M`, and `S` can take specific values within their respective ranges. The input will determine the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `s`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of `N`, `M`, and `S` as well as the values of `n`, `m`, and `s` after input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned input integer values.**
