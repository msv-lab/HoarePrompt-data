According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate for values of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Additionally, `s` must be at least 3 to allow for another iteration since the loop continues as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is `m`, and `k` is 3**
