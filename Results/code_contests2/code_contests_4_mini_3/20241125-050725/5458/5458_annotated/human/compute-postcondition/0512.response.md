The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Although this doesn't change the values of `s`, `j`, `m`, `k`, or `i`, it affects the flow of the program by skipping any remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
