Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros if `s` is 0; if `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is updated based on values of `j` and `k`. `i` is equal to 0, `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer equal to 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
