The code executes a `continue` statement, which does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the remaining iterations of the nearest enclosing loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1` (and thus greater than 0), `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
