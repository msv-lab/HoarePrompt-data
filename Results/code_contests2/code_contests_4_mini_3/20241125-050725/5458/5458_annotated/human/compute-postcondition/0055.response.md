According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently `s` (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `s`). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to `s + 1`. 

No other states, such as `dp` or the indices `i` and `j`, need to be adjusted since they are not directly affected by this loop's termination condition.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros, `k` is equal to `s + 1`**
