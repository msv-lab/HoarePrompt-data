The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index in a 3D list or array `dp`. The index for the first dimension is `i + 1 & 1`, which can result in either `0` or `1` depending on the value of `i`. 

- If `i` is `0`, then `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` is `1`.
- If `i` is not `0`, then `i + 1` is at least `2`, and `2 & 1` is `0`.

The second dimension index is `j + 1`, which is simply incrementing `j` by `1`. The third dimension index is `k`, which is equal to `s + 1`.

Thus, the output state reflects the way the `dp` array is updated based on the possible values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

- If `i` is `0`, the update affects `dp[1][j + 1][k]`.
- If `i` is not `0`, the update affects `dp[0][j + 1][k]`.

The values of `j` and `k` are not changed by this operation, and the operation does not return any value.

Output State: **`i` is 0 or not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to `s + 1, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1**
