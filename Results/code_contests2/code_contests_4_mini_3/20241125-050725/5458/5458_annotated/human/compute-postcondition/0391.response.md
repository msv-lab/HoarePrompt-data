The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables in the program; it simply skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1); `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
