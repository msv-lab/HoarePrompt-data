Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is `m`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[1][m + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than 3, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is modified based on the previous values in the `dp` array. If `j` is less than or equal to 3, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][3]` modulo `mod` and updated by adding `dp[0][j][3 - j]` modulo `mod`. No changes are made to the `dp` array if `j` is less than 3.***
