According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, which is already stated in the initial conditions. The loop variable `k` will start at 1 and will increment until it reaches `s`. 

Since `s` is at least 1, `k` will initially be 1. The condition for `dp` does not affect the execution of the loop, as it remains unchanged. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `s` must be at least 1, `k` is initialized to 1, and `dp` remains unchanged.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `k` is 1**
