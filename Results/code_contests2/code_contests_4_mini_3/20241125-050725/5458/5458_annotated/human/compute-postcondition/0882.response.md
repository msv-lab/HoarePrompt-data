Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is unchanged, and `s` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes occur in `dp`, and the loop continues to the next iteration with the original values.***
