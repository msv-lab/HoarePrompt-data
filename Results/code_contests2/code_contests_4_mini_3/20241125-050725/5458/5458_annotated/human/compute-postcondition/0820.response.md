Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the if block, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
