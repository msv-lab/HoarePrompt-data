The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input arguments. Instead, it operates based on a loop that continues to process input values for `N`, `M`, and `S` until all three values are zero. The constraints specify that `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, and `S` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000. The function produces output based on the processed values of `N`, `M`, and `S` under these constraints. 

Functionality: **The function processes input values for N, M, and S, where N is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), M is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), and S is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), and continues until all three inputs are zero.**
