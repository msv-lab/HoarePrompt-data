According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, which means the loop has executed for `k` values of 1 and 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 3 (to allow `k` to take on the value of 3), and `k` should be updated to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 3**
