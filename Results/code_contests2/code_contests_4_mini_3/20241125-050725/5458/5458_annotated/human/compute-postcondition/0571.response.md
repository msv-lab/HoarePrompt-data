Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` after applying the modulus. Thus, the state of `dp` is updated according to these conditions.***
