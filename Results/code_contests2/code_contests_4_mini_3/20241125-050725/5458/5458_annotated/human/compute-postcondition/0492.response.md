According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `j` is `m + 1`.
- `k` is 2.
- `s` is greater than or equal to 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. This means `k` needs to be adjusted to 3. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 2, it is possible for `s` to be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `k` is 3 (to allow one more iteration of the loop).

No other states need to be adjusted as `i`, `j`, and `s` are already in a valid state for the loop to continue.

State: **`dp` is updated based on the state of `i`, `j`, and `k`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3**
