According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop iterates from `k = 1` to `k = s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2, and it must still be less than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is at least 1, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 2 for the loop to continue.

So, we need to adjust the states to reflect that `k` is now 2 and `s` is at least 2.

State: **If `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2.**
