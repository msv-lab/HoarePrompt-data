Postcondition: ***If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes occur to the `dp` array. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and incorporates the previous value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` into its computation. Overall, `s` is at least 2 and `k` is 2 throughout the execution.***
