The code assigns the value `1` to the element at the position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unchanged except for `k`, which is incremented by `1` from its previous value. Therefore, the output state reflects that the specific element in the 2D list `dp` is updated to `1`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at position [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] to 1, `k` is now k + 1**
