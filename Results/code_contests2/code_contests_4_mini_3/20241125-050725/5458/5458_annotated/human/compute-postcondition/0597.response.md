To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state at the end of the previous iteration and the for loop statement.

The loop iterates over `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `i`, `j`, `s`, and possibly other variables are involved in the state, but we do not have explicit values for them.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.

Since this is a `for` loop starting from 1 and going up to `s + 1`, this means:
- At the end of the last iteration, `k` must have been equal to `s` in order for the loop to execute one more time (as the next value of `k` will be `s + 1`, which will exceed the loop's boundary).

Thus, we adjust the state to indicate that `k` should be equal to `s + 1` at the start of the next iteration. 

Considering this, the required state adjustments are:
- `k` should be `s + 1` to reflect the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`i` is 0 or not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to `s + 1`**
