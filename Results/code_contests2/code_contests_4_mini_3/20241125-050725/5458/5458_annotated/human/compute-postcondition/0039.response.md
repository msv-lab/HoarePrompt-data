According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. The loop iterates from 1 to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can continue, `k` must be adjusted to `k + 1`, and this must be less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `s`.**
