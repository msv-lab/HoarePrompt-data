The code contains a `continue` statement, which causes the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop to end, skipping the remaining code in that iteration and proceeding to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables do not change, and there is no additional context about the loop or other state changes, the output state remains the same. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
