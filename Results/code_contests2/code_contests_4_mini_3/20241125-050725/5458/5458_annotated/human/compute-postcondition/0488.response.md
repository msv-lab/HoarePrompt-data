Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `j` is greater than `k` (where `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, there are no changes to `dp`, and the program proceeds without executing the update for `dp`.***
