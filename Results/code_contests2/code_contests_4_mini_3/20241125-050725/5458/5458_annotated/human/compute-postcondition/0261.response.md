Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the dp array is updated such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no update to the dp array and the flow of execution moves to the next iteration without changes.***
