Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, and if `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][1]`, while the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the current iteration will proceed without any changes to `dp`, effectively skipping the assignment operation.***
