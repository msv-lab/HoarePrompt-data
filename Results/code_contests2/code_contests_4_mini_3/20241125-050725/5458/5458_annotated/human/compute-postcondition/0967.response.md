According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which means it has already exceeded `n ** 2` since `n + 1` is greater than or equal to 1 (assuming `n` is at least 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`.

To adjust the state, we need to set `i` to a value that is less than `n ** 2`. A possible adjustment can be to set `i` to `n ** 2 - 1`, which ensures that `i` is still valid for the next iteration.

State: **`i` is `n ** 2 - 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is between 1 and `m` (inclusive), `k` is between 1 and `s` (inclusive, if `s` is at least 1), `dp` remains unchanged.**
