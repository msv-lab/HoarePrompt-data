Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to `m`, `j`, `k`, or `s`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no action is taken, and the loop continues, maintaining the values of `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `s`.***
