Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then the value of `dp[1][4][2]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. For the case where `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][4][2]` is updated based on previous values of `dp` with consideration of modular arithmetic. In all cases, the index modifications and updates respect the given conditions.***
