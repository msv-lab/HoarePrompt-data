According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `k` would have been equal to `s` since it iterates up to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`, and since the loop condition specifies `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, the loop cannot be executed again. 

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`dp` is a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, k is 1**
