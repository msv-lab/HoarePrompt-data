Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, if `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. There is no change to the state when `j` is less than or equal to `k` since there is no else part defined.***
