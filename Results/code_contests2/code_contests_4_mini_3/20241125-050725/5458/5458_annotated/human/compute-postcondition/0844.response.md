The statement `continue` causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop in which it is located and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `i`, `m`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the current values of the variables and indicates that the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is 2, and execution continues to the next iteration of the loop**.
