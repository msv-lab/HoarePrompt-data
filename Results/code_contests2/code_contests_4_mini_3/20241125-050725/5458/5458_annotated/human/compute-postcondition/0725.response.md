The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The current value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` equals `1`. The variable `j` is `m + 1` and `k` is `1`. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to `1`, so `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is targeted.

Since `j` is `m + 1`, `j + 1` evaluates to `m + 2`, and `k` is `1`. Therefore, we are assigning `1` to `dp[1][m + 2][1]`.

The values of other variables (`s`, `dp`, `j`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged, but now `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is set to `1`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is assigned the value 1**
