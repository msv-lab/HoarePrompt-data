The provided code snippet assigns a value to a multidimensional array `dp`, specifically at the indices `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. The value assigned is taken from another index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

In the initial state:
- `i` is `n`
- `j` is `m + 1`
- `k` is 3

The value of `j` can be expressed as `m + 1`, and since `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is at least 2. 

The expression `i + 1 & 1` affects the first index of the `dp` array, determining whether it results in `0` or `1` based on the parity of `i + 1`. 

Thus, the output state remains unchanged for `s`, `m`, `j`, and `k`, but the specific assignment operation does not change their values. The output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3**
