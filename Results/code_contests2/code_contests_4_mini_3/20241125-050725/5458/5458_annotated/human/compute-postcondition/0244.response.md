The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next one. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values remain unchanged, and we note that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3; continuing to the next iteration of the loop.**
