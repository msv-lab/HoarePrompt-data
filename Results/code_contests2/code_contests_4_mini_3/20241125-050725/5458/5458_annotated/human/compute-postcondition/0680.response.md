The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables, but it affects the flow of control in the program. Since `dp` is a 2x(m + 2) list and the previous assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has been made, the values within `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
