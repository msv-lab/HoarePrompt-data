Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` before continuing to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made, and the program proceeds with the next steps.***
