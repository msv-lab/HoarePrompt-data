The code snippet is modifying a specific element in a 3-dimensional array `dp`. The index for the first dimension is calculated as `i + 1 & 1`, which will yield either `0` or `1` depending on the value of `i`. Given that `i` is `0`, `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`. 

Next, the second dimension index is `j + 1`. Since `j` is defined as `m + 1` and `m` is greater than or equal to `1`, `j` will be at least `2`. Thus, `j + 1` will be at least `3`. 

The third dimension index is simply `k`, which is `1`.

Therefore, the code assigns the value `1` to `dp[1][j + 1][1]`, where `j + 1` is at least `3`. 

The values of other variables are not affected, so we maintain their states.

Output State: **`s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and dp[1][j + 1][1] is assigned the value 1**.
