According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over a range from 1 to `s + 1`, meaning it executes as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented. Therefore, `k` should be adjusted to 4, and `s` must be at least 4 to maintain the condition for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is 4**
