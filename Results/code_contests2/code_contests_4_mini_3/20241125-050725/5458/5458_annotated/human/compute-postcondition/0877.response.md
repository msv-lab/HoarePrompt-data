According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is unchanged, and `s` is at least 1. Since `k` is currently set to its maximum value of `s + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be adjusted to be at least 2 so that `k` can iterate through the range.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is unchanged, and `s` is at least 2**
