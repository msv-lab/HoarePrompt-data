Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
