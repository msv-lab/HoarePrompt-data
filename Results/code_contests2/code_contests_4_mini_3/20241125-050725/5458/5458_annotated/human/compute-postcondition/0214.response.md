According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop iterates from 1 to `m`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 4 (since `j` currently is 3). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and `m` is greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `m` to be at least 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is between 1 and `s`.**
