Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value 1. There are no changes made to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`, and the state of other variables remains unchanged.***
