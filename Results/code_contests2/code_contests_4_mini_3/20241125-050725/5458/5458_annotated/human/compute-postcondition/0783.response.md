Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
