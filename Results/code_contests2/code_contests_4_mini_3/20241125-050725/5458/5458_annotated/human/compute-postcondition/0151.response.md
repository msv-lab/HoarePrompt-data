Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp` at position `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp` remains unchanged.***
