The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is in and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the existing variables (`i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and `dp`) do not change as a result of this statement, but we do not have any information on the loop conditions or previous iterations for `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `s`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables while indicating that we have moved to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
