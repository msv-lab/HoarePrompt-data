According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 1, which means the loop can execute again if `k` can take on a value greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be adjusted to 3 (since `k` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration). Additionally, `s` must be at least 3 to allow `k` to reach 3.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3**
