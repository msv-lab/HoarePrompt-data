Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` remains n, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 2 or greater. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no change to the state of `dp` and the current iteration of the loop ends.***
