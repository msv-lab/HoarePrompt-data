The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state will reflect that there are no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
