Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and all other variables remain unchanged. If `i` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
