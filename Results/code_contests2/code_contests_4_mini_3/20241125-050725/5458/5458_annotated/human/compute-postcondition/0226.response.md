The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop, if there is one. Since no specific information about such a loop is provided, we can only state that we continue to the next iteration without modifying any variables.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values, and we note that we are continuing in the program.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is now 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
