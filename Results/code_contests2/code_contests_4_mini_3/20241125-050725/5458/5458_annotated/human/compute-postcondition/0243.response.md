The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` have specific constraints, but since they are variables, we do not know their exact values. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will result in either 0 or 1 based on the value of `i`. The state of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` is unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, we can summarize the output state based on the variables that are being modified.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
