Output State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The loop does not execute if `s` is less than 1, in which case the values of `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the `dp` array is not modified.**
