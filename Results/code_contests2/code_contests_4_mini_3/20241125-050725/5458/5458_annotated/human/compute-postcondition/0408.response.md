Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], `j` is equal to m + 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` list in this iteration.***
