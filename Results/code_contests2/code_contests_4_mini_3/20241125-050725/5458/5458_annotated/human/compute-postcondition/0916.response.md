Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not modify `dp` and continues execution without any changes to `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, or `s`.***
