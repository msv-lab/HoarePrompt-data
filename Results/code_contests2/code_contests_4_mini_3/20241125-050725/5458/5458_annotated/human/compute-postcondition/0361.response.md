Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 and `k` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged and `k` remains the same. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while `k` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value, while `k` remains unchanged. All updates respect the initial state of `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, `m`, and `s`.***
