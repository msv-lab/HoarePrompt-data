The statement `continue` does not affect the values of the variables but instructs the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the indication that the loop iteration has been continued. 

Output State: **`s` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
