According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. The variable `i` being equal to `n` does not impact the execution of this for loop, but for the loop to start, `j` must be initialized to 1 at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
