According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and the loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

To execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, which means `k` will be 2. Since `s` is at least 1, it can accommodate this new value of `k`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`, which should now be 2. All other states remain unchanged.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and `dp` is modified at index `[1][j + 1][k]` (which corresponds to `[1][4][2]`), based on previous conditions.**
