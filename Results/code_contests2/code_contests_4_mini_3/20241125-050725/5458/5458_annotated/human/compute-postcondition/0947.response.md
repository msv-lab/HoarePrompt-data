Postcondition: ***If `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2, then when `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. There are no changes to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`, and the values of `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
