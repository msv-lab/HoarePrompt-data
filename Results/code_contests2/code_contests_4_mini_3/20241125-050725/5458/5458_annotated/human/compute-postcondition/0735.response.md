According to the code, the loop is dependent on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute again. Given that `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Thus, if the loop was previously executed with `k`, for the next iteration to occur, `k` should be `k + 1` and it must be less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to be equal to 2 (assuming it was 1 in the last iteration).

State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2**
