Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros, `m` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dp`.***
