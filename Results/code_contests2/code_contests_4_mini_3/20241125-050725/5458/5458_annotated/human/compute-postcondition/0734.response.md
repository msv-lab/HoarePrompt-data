Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1; otherwise, if `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is greater than 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All operations respect the bounds of `dp` and take into account the modulus operation.***
