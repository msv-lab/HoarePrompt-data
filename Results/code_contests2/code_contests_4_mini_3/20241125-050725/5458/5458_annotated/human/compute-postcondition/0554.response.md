To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop conditions and the current state provided.

1. The loop iterates over `k` from `1` to `s + 1`. This means that `k` must be less than or equal to `s` to continue executing the loop.
2. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to `2`.
3. The variable `s` is currently stated as greater than or equal to `1`, which means it can support at least the value `2` for `k` to execute the loop again.

No other variables (`i`, `j`, `m`, `s`) need to be adjusted since they do not affect the loop's execution in this context.

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `k` is now `2`.

State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2**
