Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2]. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, this code segment does not modify any elements of `dp`, and `k` remains unchanged at that iteration.***
