Postcondition: ***`s` is at least `1`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `m`, `dp` maintains its current state, and `k` is `1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`. If `j` is less than `1`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged, and no modifications are made to its values.***
