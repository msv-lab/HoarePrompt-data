According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s` and the range of `j`. Since `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `m`, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that the loop executed `s` times. If `s` is at least 1, the loop must have executed at least once, meaning `j` would have been at least 1 at the start of that iteration. 

To execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is incremented from its last value. Therefore, if `j` is currently `m`, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be increased (or adjusted) to allow `j` to take a value greater than its last iteration value. 

Since the loop iterates from 1 to `m`, if it has executed `s` times, then `j` would be `m` after the last iteration. To allow the loop to execute one more time, we can set `m` to be at least `m + 1`.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure `j` can take the next value in the iteration.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least `m + 1`, `j` is `m + 1`**
