The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`s` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
