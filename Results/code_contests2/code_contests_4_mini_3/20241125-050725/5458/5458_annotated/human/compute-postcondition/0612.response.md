In the provided code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`, the following happens:

1. The operation `i + 1 & 1` evaluates the expression. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1. The expression then becomes `1 & 1`, which results in 1.
2. The variable `j` is at least 3, so `j + 1` is at least 4.
3. The variable `k` is 1.
4. Thus, the assignment `dp[1][j + 1][1] = 1` modifies the value in the `dp` array at the specified indices.

The values of `s`, `m`, `j`, `dp`, and `k` remain unchanged overall, but the specific entry in `dp` is altered.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `dp` is modified at index [1][j + 1][1], `k` is 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
