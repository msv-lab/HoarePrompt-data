Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]`. In the case where `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3] % mod` and incremented by `dp[i & 1][3][0] % mod`, where `k - j` is 0. This ensures that all relevant conditions regarding the values of `j` and `k` are addressed in the final state of the `dp` array.***
