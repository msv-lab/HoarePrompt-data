Output State: **If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all greater than 0, the loop executes, and `dp` is updated according to the dynamic programming relations based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `s`. After the loop completes, the printed output is `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`. If any of `n`, `m`, or `s` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `dp` will remain uninitialized (or at its initial state), with no output printed. The loop terminates when the input values are all zero, leaving `n`, `m`, and `s` unchanged in this case.**
