According to the code, the `for` loop will execute `n ** 2` times for `i` from `0` to `n ** 2 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` will be `n ** 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n ** 2`. 

Since `i` is incremented in each iteration starting from `0`, we need to represent the state such that `i` is now equal to `n ** 2`. The value of `n` does not change, and since `i` is the only relevant variable being modified for the loop control, that is the only state that needs to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is `n ** 2`**
