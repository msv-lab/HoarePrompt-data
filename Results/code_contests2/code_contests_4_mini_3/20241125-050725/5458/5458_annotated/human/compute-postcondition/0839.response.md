Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0, `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The state of the `dp` array is modified based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`, while ensuring that all values respect the modulus operation where applicable.***
