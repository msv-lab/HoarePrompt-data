Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the element at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no updates to `dp` occur, and the program proceeds without modifying the state of `dp`.***
