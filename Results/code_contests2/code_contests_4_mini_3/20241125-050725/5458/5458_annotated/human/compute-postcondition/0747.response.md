The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `s` and `k` do not directly affect this statement. However, the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of the `dp` array after this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
