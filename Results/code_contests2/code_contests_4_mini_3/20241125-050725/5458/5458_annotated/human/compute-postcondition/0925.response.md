Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. There are no changes to the variables if the condition `j > k` is not met.***
