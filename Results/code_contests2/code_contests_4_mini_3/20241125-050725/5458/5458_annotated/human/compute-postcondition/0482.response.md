Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the state of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than or equal to `k` (1), then `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The variable `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1 throughout the execution.***
