According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from `1` to `s`, meaning it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4. Therefore, `s` must be greater than or equal to 4 to ensure that the loop can execute for `k = 4`. 

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 4**
