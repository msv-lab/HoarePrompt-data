Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` is set to 1, specifically `dp[1][3][2]` when `i` is 0 and `dp[0][3][2]` when `i` is greater than 0. No changes are made to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`.***
