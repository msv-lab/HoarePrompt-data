Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration without any changes to the state of other variables. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp` or the state of the program.***
