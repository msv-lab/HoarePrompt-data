According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1 since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `s + 1`. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is unchanged. To ensure the loop executes, we need to verify that `s` is at least 1. Additionally, `k` will start at 1 at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is unchanged, `dp` is unchanged, `s` is at least 1**
