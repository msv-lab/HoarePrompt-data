Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `k` is 1, `i` is greater than 0, and if `j` is greater than 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop. If `j` is less than or equal to 1, the program does not modify `dp` and continues without further actions.***
