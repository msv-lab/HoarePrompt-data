Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][m + 2], `i` is 2, `n` is such that k + 1 < n, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1 or greater than or equal to `k`, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`.***
