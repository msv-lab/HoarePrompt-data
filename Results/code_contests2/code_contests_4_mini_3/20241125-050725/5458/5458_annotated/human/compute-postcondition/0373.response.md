The code `continue` means that the program will skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables in the initial state remain unchanged, and the state of the program does not alter any of the variable values. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`; `j` is greater than `k` (1) and less than or equal to `m`; `i` is greater than or equal to 1; `m` is unchanged; `s` is greater than or equal to 1; `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`; `j` is greater than `k` (1) and less than or equal to `m`; `i` is greater than or equal to 1; `m` is unchanged; `s` is greater than or equal to 1; `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
