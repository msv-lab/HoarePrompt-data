Output State: **After the loop executes `s` times, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` is set to 1 for the last iteration. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` remains unchanged. If `i` is `n` and `j` is greater than `s`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][s]`. For `i` not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][s]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `s`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` is updated based on both `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][s] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][s - j] % mod`. The loop will execute `s` times if `s` is greater than 0; if `s` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `k` remains 1, while `i`, `j`, and `m` retain their initial values.**
