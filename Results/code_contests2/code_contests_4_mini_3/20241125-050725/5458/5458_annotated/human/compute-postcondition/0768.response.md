Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than 0, `i` is `n` and not equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program proceeds without making any changes to `dp`, but the values of the variables remain as described.***
