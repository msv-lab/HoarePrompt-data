Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, and `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `dp` are adjusted based on the conditions involving `i`, `j`, and `k`, while ensuring all constraints on the variables remain satisfied.***
