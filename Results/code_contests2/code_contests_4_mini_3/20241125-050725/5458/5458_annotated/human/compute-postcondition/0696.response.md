The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables or data structures, but it does affect the control flow by skipping the current iteration of a loop. Since `dp` is updated prior to this statement, the previous state of `dp` remains unchanged due to the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state is `dp` has been updated before the continue statement, and we skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` has been updated before the continue statement, and we skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop.**
