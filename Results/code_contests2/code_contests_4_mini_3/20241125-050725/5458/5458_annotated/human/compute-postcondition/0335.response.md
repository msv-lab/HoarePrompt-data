Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1). If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index [1][j + 1][1] of `dp` is updated to 1. The variables `i`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged, with `i` equal to 0, `n` greater than 0, `m` greater than or equal to 1, `j` greater than or equal to `k`, `k` equal to 1, and `s` greater than or equal to 1.***
