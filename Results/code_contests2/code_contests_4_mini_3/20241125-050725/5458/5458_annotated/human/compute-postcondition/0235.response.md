The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
