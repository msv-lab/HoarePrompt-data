According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, since `k` starts at 1, it will be 1 at the beginning of the loop. 

The list `dp` appears to be structured based on the value of `s`, but the specifics of its content do not directly affect the execution of the loop. However, we can note that if `s` is 0, the loop will not execute at all, which is not desired if we want to ensure the execution.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, `s` must be at least 1, and `k` should start at 1.

State: **`dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros if `s` is 0; if `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is updated based on values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, `j` is `j + 1` (where `j` is less than `m`), `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
