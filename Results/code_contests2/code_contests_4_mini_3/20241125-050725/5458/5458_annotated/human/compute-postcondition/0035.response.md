Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, which remains 0, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not modify `dp` and proceeds to the next part of the code.***
