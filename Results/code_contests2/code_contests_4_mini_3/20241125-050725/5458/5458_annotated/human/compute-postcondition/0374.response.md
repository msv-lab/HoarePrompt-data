Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1); if `j` is greater than `k` (1), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; `j` remains between 1 and `m`, `i` is at least 1, `m` is unchanged, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1; otherwise, no changes are made to `dp` and the loop continues.***
