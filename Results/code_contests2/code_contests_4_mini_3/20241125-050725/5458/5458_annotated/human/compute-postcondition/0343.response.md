Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, with the variables `i`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remaining unchanged. The values of `j` and `k` are constrained by the conditions of the if statements, ensuring that all edge cases concerning their relationships are accounted for in the updates to `dp`.***
