According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1, which is already satisfied in the current state. However, the starting value of `j` needs to be adjusted. Since `j` starts at 1 in the loop and is currently unchanged, this means it can directly take the value of 1 without any modifications. 

For the loop to be executed, the following states are sufficient:
- `i` can remain as `n + 1`.
- `m` is at least 1.
- `j` should take the value of 1, the first value in the range.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is unchanged, `dp` is unchanged**
