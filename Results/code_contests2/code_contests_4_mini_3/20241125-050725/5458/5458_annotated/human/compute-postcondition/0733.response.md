The statement modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will change, while the other variables remain unaffected. The specific values of `dp`, `k`, `j`, and `i` are not provided beyond their conditions, but the operation will depend on them.

Thus, the output state reflects that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the specified calculation.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, `j` is m + 1 and greater than 1, `k` is 1, `i` is greater than 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
