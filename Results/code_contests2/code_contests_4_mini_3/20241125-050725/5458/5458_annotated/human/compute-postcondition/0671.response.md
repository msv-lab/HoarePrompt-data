The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and go to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][1]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][1]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
