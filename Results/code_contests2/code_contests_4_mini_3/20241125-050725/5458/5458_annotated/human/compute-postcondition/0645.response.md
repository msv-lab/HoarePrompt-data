Output State: **If n > 0, m > 0, and s > 0, the loop will execute n² times, updating the dp array based on the conditions involving i, j, and k. After the loop completes, `dp` will contain values based on the dynamic programming relation defined in the loop. If n ≤ 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged with all elements initialized to [0] * (s + 1). If m < 1 or s < 1, the loops for j and k will not execute, respectively, leaving `dp` unchanged. In cases where j < 1 or j > m, the loop does not execute for those j values, and dp remains unchanged for that iteration.**
