Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1). If `i` is 0 and `j` is between 1 and `m`, then for each `k` from 1 to `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then for each `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `j` is less than 1 or greater than `m`, the loop will not execute, leaving `dp` unchanged with all values initialized to 0. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged.**
