The code contains a `continue` statement, which is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `s`, `k`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects that there is no change in the values of these variables, and it indicates that we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` remains n, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 2 or greater, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
