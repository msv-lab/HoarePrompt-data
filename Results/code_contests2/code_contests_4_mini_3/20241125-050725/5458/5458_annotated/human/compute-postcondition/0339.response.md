The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but we note that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is updated such that `dp[0][j][k] = dp[0][j + 1][k]`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
