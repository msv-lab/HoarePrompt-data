The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration in the loop. 

Output State: **`i` is 0 or not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to `s + 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
