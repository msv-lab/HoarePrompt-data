The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
