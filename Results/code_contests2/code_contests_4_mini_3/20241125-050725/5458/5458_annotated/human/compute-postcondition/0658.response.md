Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated to 1; otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged at the specified position.***
