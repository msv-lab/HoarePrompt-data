The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same, and it indicates that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
