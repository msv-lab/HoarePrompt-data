Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is 2, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the execution proceeds without modifying `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
