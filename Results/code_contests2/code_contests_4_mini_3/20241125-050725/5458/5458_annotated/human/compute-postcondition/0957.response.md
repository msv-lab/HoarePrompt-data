The code assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variable `i` is currently 0, so `i + 1` is 1, and `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 1 (since both are 1 in binary). The variable `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3. The variable `k` is 3 and remains unchanged. The state of the `dp` array changes based on the operation.

However, since we do not have explicit values for the `dp` array in the initial state, we cannot define specific values for the elements being read or assigned. We can only state that the assignment is made based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

The output state will reflect that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
