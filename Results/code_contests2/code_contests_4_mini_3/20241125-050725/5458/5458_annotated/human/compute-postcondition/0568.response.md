Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the if block and continues to the next iteration without modifying `dp`.***
