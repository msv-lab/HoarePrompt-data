The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the `dp` array at the indices calculated from the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The value of `i` is unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is `2`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will compute the value based on the binary AND operation, which results in either `0` or `1`, depending on the least significant bit of `i + 1`. 

The specific value of `m` is not provided, but since `j` is `m + 1`, we can only say `j` is greater than or equal to `2`, given that `s` is greater than or equal to `2`.

Thus, the output state reflects the changes made to the `dp` array at the specified indices, without altering the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is updated based on `i + 1 & 1`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2.

Output State: **`dp` is updated based on `i + 1 & 1`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2**
