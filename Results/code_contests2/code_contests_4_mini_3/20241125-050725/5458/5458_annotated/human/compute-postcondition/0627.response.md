Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program continues with the next steps without modifying `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
