Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2]. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes occur to `dp`. The variable `i` remains equal to 0, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1.***
