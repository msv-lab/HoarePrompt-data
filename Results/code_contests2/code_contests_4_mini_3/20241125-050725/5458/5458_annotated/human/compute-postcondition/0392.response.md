Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1); if `j` is greater than `k` (which is 3), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration, effectively skipping any subsequent operations in the current iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp` in this block.***
