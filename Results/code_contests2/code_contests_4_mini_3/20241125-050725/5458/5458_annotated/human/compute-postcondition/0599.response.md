Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. There are no changes to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`, but given the precondition, `j` will always be greater than or equal to `k`, ensuring that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1 in this context.***
