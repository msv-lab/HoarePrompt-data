According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its maximum value of `s`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`. Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to `s + 1`. Other states, such as `dp`, `i`, and `j`, do not need to be changed since they are not directly influenced by the execution of the loop in this context.

State: **`dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros if `s` is 0. If `s` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the computation involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, k is `s + 1`**
