Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, ensuring that the program accounts for the modulus operation with `mod`. In all cases, the modifications to `dp` reflect the values and relationships dictated by the conditions of `i` and `j`.***
