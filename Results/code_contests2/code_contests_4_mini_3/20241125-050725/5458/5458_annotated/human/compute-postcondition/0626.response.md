The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables `s`, `m`, `j`, `k`, or `dp` but skips the current iteration of the loop it is within. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
