Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is between 1 and `m` (inclusive), `k` is between 1 and `s` (inclusive, if `s` is at least 1). The loop executes `m` times if `m` is at least 1 and `s` is at least 1; if `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `j` remains undefined while `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include both `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `m` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and the values of `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `dp` remain unchanged.**
