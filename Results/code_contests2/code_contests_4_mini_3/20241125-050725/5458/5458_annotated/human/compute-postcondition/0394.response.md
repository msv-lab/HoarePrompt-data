Since `dp` remains unchanged and no specific values for `i`, `j`, or `k` are provided, the operation does not affect the state of the variables. The operation relies on conditions that are not met, so there are no changes to `dp`.

Output State: **`dp` remains unchanged since no specific values for `i`, `j`, or `k` are provided, and the operation does not affect the state.**
