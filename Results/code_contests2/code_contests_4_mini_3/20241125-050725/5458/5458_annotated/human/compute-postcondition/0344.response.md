According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute again.

Given that the loop starts with `k` equal to 1 and continues until it is less than or equal to `s`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, if the current value of `k` at the end of the last iteration is `s`, it should be adjusted to `s + 1` for the loop to stop. To execute one more time, `k` must be `s + 1`, indicating that the loop will not execute again since it exceeds the range.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1), `i` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `k` is greater than `s`**
