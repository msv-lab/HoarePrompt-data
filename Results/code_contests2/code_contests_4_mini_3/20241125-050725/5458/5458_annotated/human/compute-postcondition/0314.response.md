Since the code snippet provided indicates that the assignment only occurs when `j` is greater than `k`, and given the initial state specifies that `k` is 2, if `j` is not greater than `k`, then the body of the if statement does not execute and no changes are made to `dp`. Therefore, we can only conclude the state based on the information given.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and no changes are made to `dp`**.
