Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2; if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`; if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no modifications are made to `dp`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
