According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`, which means the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be adjusted to allow the loop to execute one more time. If the last value of `j` was `m`, then for the loop to execute again, `j` should be `m + 1`. Additionally, the loop will not execute if `s < 1`, but since it was specified that `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged if that is the case, we can assume that `s` is not impacting the ability of the loop to execute.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `j` to `m + 1`.

State: **`dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is unchanged**
