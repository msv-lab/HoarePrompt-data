The values of the variables do not change, but we continue with the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp` is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp` is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**.
