According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, `j` must be adjusted to `m + 1`. The value of `m` itself does not change based on the loop's execution.

State: **`i` is 0, `m` is unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is unchanged, and `dp` is unchanged**
