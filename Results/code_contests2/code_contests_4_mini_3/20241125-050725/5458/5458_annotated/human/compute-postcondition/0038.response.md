Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `s`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j < k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged at 0. If `i > 0` and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i > 0` and `j <= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, potentially modifying the value based on the previous state.***
