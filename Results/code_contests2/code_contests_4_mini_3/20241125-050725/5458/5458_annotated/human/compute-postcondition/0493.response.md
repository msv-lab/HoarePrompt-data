The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` updates the value of the 3D array `dp`. The indices used for this update are determined by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, while `j` is `m + 1` and `k` is `3`. 

The operation `i + 1 & 1` is a bitwise operation that will yield either `0` or `1`, depending on the value of `i`. The value of `j + 1` will be `m + 2`.

Since `s` is greater than or equal to `3`, it does not directly affect the assignment but indicates that there may be conditions related to `s` that are satisfied.

The output state reflects that the value of `dp` at the indices computed has been set to `1`, without changing the previous values of `i`, `j`, or `k`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][m + 2][3]` to 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3**
