The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the loop, continuing to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the values of the variables, but we note that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is `n` and is not equal to 0; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is greater than 1; `k` is 1; `s` is greater than or equal to 1; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
