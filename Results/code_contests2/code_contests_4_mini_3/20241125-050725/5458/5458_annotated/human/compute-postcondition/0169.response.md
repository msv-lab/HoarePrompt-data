According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3.

Thus, the condition for the loop to execute again is that `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which means `s` should be at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3.**
