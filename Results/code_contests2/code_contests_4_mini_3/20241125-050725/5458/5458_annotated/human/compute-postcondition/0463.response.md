Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][m + 2], `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged as it is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the iteration continues without any modifications to the state. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged in this iteration.***
