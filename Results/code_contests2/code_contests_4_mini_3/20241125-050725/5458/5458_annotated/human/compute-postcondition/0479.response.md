Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while `i` remains unchanged, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
