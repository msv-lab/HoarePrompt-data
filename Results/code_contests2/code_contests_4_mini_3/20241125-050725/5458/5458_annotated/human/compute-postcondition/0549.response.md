The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement, but we acknowledge that we are skipping the rest of the current iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `n` and not equal to 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and an entry in the `dp` array has been updated based on the current indices.
