According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 since it iterates over `i` in the range of `n ** 2`. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all. At the start of the loop, `i` will need to be initialized to its starting value, which is 0 for the first execution of the loop.

For the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0, and initially, `i` is 0. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with 2 lists, each containing (m + 2) lists of (s + 1) zeros, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
