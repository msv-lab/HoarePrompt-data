Postcondition: ***`i` is `n` and not equal to 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the entry in the `dp` array at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` array.***
