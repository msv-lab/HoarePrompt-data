Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros if `s` is 0; if `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is updated based on values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1.***
