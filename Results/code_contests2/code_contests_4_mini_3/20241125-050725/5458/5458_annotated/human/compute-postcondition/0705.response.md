The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we are inside due to the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is updated such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is updated such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**
