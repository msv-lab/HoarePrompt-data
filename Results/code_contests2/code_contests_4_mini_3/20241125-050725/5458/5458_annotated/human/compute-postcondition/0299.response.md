According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`. The variable `s` is at least 1 at the end of the previous iteration, which means that the loop can execute again if `s` is greater than or equal to 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `k` must have been `s` for the loop to run one more time. For the loop to execute again, `k` should be incremented to `k + 1`, which means it should be at least `2`. However, since `k` was in the range of `1` to `s`, and `k` could only take values up to `s`, we need to adjust `s` to be at least 2 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`s` is at least 2**
