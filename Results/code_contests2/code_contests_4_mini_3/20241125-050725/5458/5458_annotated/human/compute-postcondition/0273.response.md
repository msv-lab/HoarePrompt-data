Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` can be either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1; otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp` is updated to maintain the previous state at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged from its previous state. In summary, if `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, reflecting the initial conditions of the variables.***
