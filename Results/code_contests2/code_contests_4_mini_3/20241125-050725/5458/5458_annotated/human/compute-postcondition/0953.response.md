Postcondition: ***If `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, and given the conditions for `m`, `j`, `k`, and `s`, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][3][2]` is set to the value of `dp[0][2][2]`, otherwise `dp[1][3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[0][2][0] % mod` to its current value. In all cases, the values of `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
