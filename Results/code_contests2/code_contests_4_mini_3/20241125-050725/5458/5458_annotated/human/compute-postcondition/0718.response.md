Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` plus the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The structure of `dp` is maintained, with its elements being updated based on the conditions related to `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
