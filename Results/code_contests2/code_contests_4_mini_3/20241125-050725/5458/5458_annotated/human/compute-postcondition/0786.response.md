Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made, and the program proceeds without modifying the `dp` array.***
