Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated such that if `j` (which is `m + 1`) is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 2), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. Additionally, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2.***
