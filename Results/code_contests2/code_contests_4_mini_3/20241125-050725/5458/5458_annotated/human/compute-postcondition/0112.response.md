According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. Since `n` is given to be greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to `n`, it is not directly related to the execution of the loop. Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 1, and we also need to define the initial state of `j`, which should start at 1 (the first value in the range).

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
