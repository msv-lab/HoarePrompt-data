According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop runs for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4, and `s` must also be at least 4 to allow that iteration. 

Since `s` is already greater than or equal to 3, we can adjust it to be at least 4 for the next iteration. Therefore, the relevant states that need to be adjusted are:

- `k` should be updated to 4.
- `s` should be updated to be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is 4.**
