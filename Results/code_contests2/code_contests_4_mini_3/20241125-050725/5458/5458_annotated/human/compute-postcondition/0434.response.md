According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` would be equal to the current iteration count, which is `i`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n ** 2`.

Assuming `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `k + 1`, and we need to ensure that `k + 1` is still less than `n ** 2`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the rest of the conditions do not affect the loop execution.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1), `i` is k + 1, `n` is such that k + 1 < n ** 2**
