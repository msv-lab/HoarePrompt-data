Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][m + 2]. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 2 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, plus the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The conditions `k + 1 < n`, `m >= 1`, `j >= 1`, and `s >= 1` remain satisfied throughout.***
