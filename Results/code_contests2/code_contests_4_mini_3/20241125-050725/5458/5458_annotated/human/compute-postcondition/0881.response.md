The statement `continue` causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of executing this statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is unchanged, and `s` is at least 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
