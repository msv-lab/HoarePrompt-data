Postcondition: ***If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding it to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, ensuring that all operations respect the conditions given by `s`, `k`, `m`, and the values of `i` and `j`.***
