The code updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous state of the affected variables is as follows: `i` is either 0 or not 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`. 

Since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, it implies that `k - j` will be less than or equal to `s`. Thus, the access to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is valid, and the addition will be performed.

The output state summarizes the changes made to the `dp` array based on the current conditions. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is either 0 or not 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `k` is equal to `s + 1; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`i` is either 0 or not 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `k` is equal to `s + 1; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
