The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that the current iteration of a loop will be skipped, and the next iteration will begin immediately. Therefore, the output state is `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 4, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
