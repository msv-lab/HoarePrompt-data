Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `dp` remains a 2x(m + 2) list containing lists of (s + 1) zeros, `j` is m + 1 and greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. There is no else part in the code, indicating that if the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dp`, and the loop proceeds as per its design.***
