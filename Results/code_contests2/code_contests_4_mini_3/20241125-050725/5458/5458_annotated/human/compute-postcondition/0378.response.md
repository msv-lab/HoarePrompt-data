According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from `k = 1` to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented. Thus, the next value of `k` should be 2 for the loop to continue executing.

Since `s` remains unchanged, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 2], where each element is a list of [0] * (s + 1), k is 2**
