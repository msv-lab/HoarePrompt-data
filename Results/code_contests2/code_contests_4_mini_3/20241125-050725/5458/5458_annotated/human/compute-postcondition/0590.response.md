Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` remains n, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 2 or greater. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, indicating that the condition for `j` being at least `k` is satisfied, while no changes occur to the variables if `j` is less than `k`.***
