According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been updated to some value between 1 and `m`. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to `j + 1`. The condition also implies that `m` must be at least `j + 1` for the loop to continue executing.

Since we do not have explicit values for `j` and `m`, we can state that `j` should be adjusted accordingly and `m` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1` to allow the next iteration of the loop to occur.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`**
