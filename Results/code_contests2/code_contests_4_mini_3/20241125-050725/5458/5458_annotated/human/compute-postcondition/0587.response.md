Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` remains n, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 2 or greater. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp` remains unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, considering the modulus operation. The edge cases of `j` being exactly equal to `k`, and whether the updates to `dp` depend on the current state of `dp` when `i` is not 0, are also covered.***
