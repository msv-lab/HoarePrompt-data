The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop it is currently in. Therefore, the output state reflects that no values have changed, and we are continuing to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or between 1 and `n-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration.**
