The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop, moving to the next iteration instead. Therefore, the output state is unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` remains n and is not equal to 0, `m` remains greater than 0, `j` is 2, `dp` remains unchanged, and `j` is greater than `k`.**
