The function accepts three integer inputs, `n`, `m`, and `s`, from user input and processes them until all three inputs are zero. For each set of inputs, it uses dynamic programming to compute a value based on the relationships defined in the nested loops and stores the results in a 3D list `dp`. Finally, it prints the computed value `dp[n
