To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements:

### Problem Requirements:
1. Create a bingo card of size `N x N` with integers from `1` to `M`.
2. The integers must be unique and their sum must equal `S`.
3. Each column must be sorted in ascending order.
4. Each integer in a square must be larger than any integer in the column to its left.
5. The output should be the remainder of the number of distinct bingo cards that can be created, divided by `100000`.

### Provided Code Logic:
1. The program reads multiple datasets until it encounters `0 0 0`.
2. It initializes a dynamic programming table `dp` to count the distinct bingo cards.
3. It uses nested loops to fill in the DP table based on the constraints outlined in the problem description.
4. Finally, it prints the result from the DP table for each dataset.

### Code Analysis:
- The code uses a dynamic programming approach to build up the number of valid configurations for the bingo cards.
- It checks conditions based on the sum and the constraints of the bingo card (column order and uniqueness).
- The key operations involve indexing into a 3D DP table, which is structured to handle the card size, range of integers, and the target sum.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Values**: What happens if `N = 1`, `M = 1`, and `S = 1`? In this case, the only possible bingo card is `[[1]]`, which meets all criteria. It should return `1`.
2. **Maximum Values**: If `N = 7`, `M = 2000`, and `S = 3000`, does the program still hold correct logic under maximum constraints?
3. **Sum Condition**: For cases where `S` is less than the minimum possible sum (e.g., `N=3`, `M=5`, `S=5`), the program should recognize that no valid cards can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The code logic seems to handle the basic constraints, but it might not adequately cover scenarios where the required sum `S` is not achievable with the provided `N` and `M`. 

**Example of Failure Case**:
- If `N = 3`, `M = 5`, and `S = 5`, the minimum sum of the smallest unique numbers would be `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28`, which is already larger than `5`. Hence, the program should return `0` for this case, but it may not handle this case correctly.

Thus, since the program does not account for cases where the sum `S` is impossible to achieve, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
