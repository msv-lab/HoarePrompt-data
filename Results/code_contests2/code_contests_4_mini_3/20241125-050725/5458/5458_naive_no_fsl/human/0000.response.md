To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and constraints of the program.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Bingo Card Requirements**:
   - Size is N x N.
   - Values are between 1 and M, and all values are unique.
   - The sum of the values must equal S.
   - Each column should be in ascending order.
   - Each value in the card must be greater than any value in the previous column.

2. **Input/Output**:
   - Input consists of multiple datasets with N, M, and S until a line containing "0 0 0".
   - Output should be the number of valid Bingo cards modulo 100000.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of valid Bingo cards based on the given constraints.

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - `dp[i][j][k]` represents the number of ways to fill the first `i` cells with maximum number `j` and summing to `k`.
  
2. **Logic Flow**:
   - The outer loop iterates over the total cells (NÂ²).
   - The inner loops iterate through possible values (1 to M) and possible sums (1 to S).
   - The program checks conditions to fill the DP table based on previously defined values.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Column Ascending Order**: The program does not seem to explicitly enforce that each column must be in ascending order when filling the table. It uses the condition `if j > k:` to skip invalid placements, but this does not guarantee that the values in columns will respect the ascending order requirement.
2. **Unique Values**: The program also does not seem to check for the uniqueness of the values as it fills the DP table. It only checks if a value is greater than the current sum, which may lead to duplicates being considered.

### Example Case:
Consider the case where:
- N = 2, M = 3, S = 4
- The valid Bingo card should be:
  ```
  1 3
  2 0 (not valid since 0 is not allowed)
  ```
  The only valid card would be:
  ```
  1 2
  3 0 (again not valid)
  ```
  Hence, there are no valid cards, but the program may incorrectly count arrangements due to the lack of checks for uniqueness and column order.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not effectively ensure the constraints of the Bingo card as described in the problem, we can conclude that there are potential cases where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
