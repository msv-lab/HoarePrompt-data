The function accepts multiple sets of integer inputs for `n`, `m`, and `s`, processing each set until the input "0 0 0" is encountered. It computes a dynamic programming table `dp` based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, and prints the result of `dp[n^2 & 1][m + 1][s]` modulo 100000 for each valid input. The function does not return any value but outputs results directly to the console. It handles edge cases where `n`, `m`, and `s` are all zero, terminating the input loop without further processing.
