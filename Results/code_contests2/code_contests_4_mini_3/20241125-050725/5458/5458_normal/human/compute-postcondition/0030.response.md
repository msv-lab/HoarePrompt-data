According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `k` must be less than `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than `s`, specifically `k` must be changed to `s - 1`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `n`, `i`, `m`, and `s` do not change due to the loop execution.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is equal to `s - 1`**
