According to the code, the `while 1` loop is an infinite loop, meaning it will certainly execute one more time regardless of the current state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states to allow the loop to execute again. 

State: **`if n <= 0`, `m < 1`, or `s < 1`, then `dp` remains unchanged as a 2D list filled with zeros, and the function returns `dp[n`**
