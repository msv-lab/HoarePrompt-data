The statement modifies a two-dimensional list `dp` based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` determines which index to access in the first dimension of `dp`, resulting in either `0` or `1` depending on the value of `i`. 

- If `i` is `0`, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`, so `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`.
- If `i` is `1`, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0`, so `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`.

Other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`) are not directly affected by this operation, and their values remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables, along with the assignment operation performed on `dp`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
