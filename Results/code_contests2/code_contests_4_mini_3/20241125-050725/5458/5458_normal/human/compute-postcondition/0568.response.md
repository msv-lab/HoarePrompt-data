Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not modify `dp` and proceeds with the next iteration of the loop. The conditions ensure that all necessary values and relationships are maintained throughout the execution.***
