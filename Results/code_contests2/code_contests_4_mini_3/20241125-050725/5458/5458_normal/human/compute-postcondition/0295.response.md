Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1 & 1][2][k]` depends on the values of `i`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to 2, with `i` greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no assignments are made to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
