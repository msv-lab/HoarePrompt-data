Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. There is no else part, so if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the given block and may proceed with other logic not shown here.***
