Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring that all updates to `dp` adhere to the defined relationships of `i`, `j`, and `k`. These conditions collectively ensure that the integrity of the `dp` data structure is maintained throughout the operation.***
