The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` implies that a specific element in the `dp` array is being assigned a value of `1`. Here, the index for the first dimension is `i + 1 & 1`, which means we need to evaluate `i + 1` first and then apply the bitwise AND operation with `1`.

Given that `i` is `0`, we calculate:
- `i + 1` is `1`
- `1 & 1` is `1`

Thus, the first index for the `dp` array becomes `1`.

The second index is `j + 1`. Since `j` is at least `1`, `j + 1` is at least `2`.

The third index remains `k`, which is `1`.

Therefore, we assign `1` to `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. The other variables `m`, `s`, and `j` are not directly affected by this assignment.

The output state is:
`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and the assignment `dp[1][j + 1][k] = 1` takes place.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][k] = 1`**.
