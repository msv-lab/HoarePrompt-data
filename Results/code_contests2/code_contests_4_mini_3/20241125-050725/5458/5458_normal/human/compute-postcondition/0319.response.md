According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, which is the last index used in the previous iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since the loop starts from `j = 1` and goes up to `m`, if `j` is currently `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to `m + 1`.

State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`, where `j` is now `m + 1`**
