Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the next iteration of the loop continues. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the if block, and the values of `dp` remain unchanged in this context.***
