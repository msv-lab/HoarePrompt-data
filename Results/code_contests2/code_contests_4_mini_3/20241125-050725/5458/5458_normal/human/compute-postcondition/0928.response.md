Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All updates to `dp` depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, ensuring the constraints on all other variables remain intact.***
