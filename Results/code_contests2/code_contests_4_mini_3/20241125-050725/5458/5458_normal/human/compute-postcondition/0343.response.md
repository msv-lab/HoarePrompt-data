Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 0, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to `dp`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
