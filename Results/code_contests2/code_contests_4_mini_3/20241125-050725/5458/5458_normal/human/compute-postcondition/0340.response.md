Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 0, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; during this iteration, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes to the variables occur, and the program does not continue.***
