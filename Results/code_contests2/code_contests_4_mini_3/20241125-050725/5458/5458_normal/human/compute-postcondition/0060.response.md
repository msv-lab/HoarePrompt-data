Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program assigns `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and continues to the next iteration of the loop, skipping any further execution for the current iteration.***
