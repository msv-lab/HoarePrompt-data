Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `i` is a positive integer, and `m` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the execution does not modify `dp` and continues to the next iteration without any changes.***
