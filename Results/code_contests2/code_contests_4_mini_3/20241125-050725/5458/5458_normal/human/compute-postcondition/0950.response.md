Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without executing further statements, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
