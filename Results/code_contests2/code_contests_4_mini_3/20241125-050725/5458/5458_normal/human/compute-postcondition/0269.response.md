The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the rest of the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. Since the values of `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, the output state will reflect that no changes were made to the variables, and we indicate that we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
