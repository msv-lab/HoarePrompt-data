The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
