The statement `continue` is encountered, which causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is still equal to `dp[1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
