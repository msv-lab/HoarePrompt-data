The statement assigns the value `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i` and `k` remain unchanged, while `j` is assigned the value of `m`. Since `s` is at least 2 and is not directly affected, we note that `s` remains at least 2. The impact of the operation is that it sets a specific element in the 3D array `dp` to `1` based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m`, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
