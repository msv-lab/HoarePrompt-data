Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the assignment and continues to the next iteration without any changes to `dp`.***
