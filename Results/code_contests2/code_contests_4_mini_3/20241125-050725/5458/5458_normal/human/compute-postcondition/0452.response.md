The code assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `s`, `j`, `m`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment, but `j` is incremented by 1 for the indexing of the `dp` array. The other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 2, `j` is at least 1 (now incremented to at least 2), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2**
