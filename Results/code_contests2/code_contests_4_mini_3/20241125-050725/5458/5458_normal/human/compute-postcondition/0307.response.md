Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is 2), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, the operations respect the precondition that `s` is greater than or equal to 2 and `m` is greater than or equal to 2.***
