The code assigns the values obtained from `raw_input()` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `s`, converting them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are overwritten with new integer values from input. The specific values of the new integers are not provided, so the output state indicates that the variables have been reassigned. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `s` is an integer between 1 and 3000 inclusive, and the new values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned from input.**
