The variable `mod` is assigned the value 100000. The initial states of `n`, `m`, and `s` are not affected by this assignment, as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged initial values along with the new assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `s` is an integer between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is 100000**
