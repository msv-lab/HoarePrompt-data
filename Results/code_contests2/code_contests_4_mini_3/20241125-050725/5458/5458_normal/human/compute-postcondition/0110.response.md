Output State: **`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, where `j` varies from 1 to `m` and `k` varies from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j < k`, `dp` remains unchanged at that index. If `i > 0` and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i > 0` and `j <= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on values from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, while considering modulo. The loop will not execute if `s` is less than 1, in which case `k` will not be defined and `dp` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `j` is less than or equal to `k` for all iterations, the corresponding entries in `dp` may not get updated, reflecting the specific relationship between `j` and `k`.**
