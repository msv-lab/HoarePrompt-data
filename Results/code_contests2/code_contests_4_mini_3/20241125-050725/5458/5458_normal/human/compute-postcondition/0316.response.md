Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variables `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`, ensuring all edge cases are handled.***
