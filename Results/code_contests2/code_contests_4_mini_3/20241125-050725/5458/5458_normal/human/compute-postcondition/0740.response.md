Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without further modifications to `dp`. There are no changes to `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, or `k` in this case, as the else part is absent.***
