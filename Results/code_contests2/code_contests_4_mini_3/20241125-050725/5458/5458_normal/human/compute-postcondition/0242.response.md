Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is an integer (either 0 or a positive integer), `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In the case where `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
