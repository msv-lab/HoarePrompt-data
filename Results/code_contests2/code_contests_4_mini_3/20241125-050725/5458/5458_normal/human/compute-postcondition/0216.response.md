According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n ** 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. Since there is no direct information on the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, but we can infer it must be less than `n ** 2` for the loop to execute.

If `i` is currently at its maximum value of `n ** 2 - 1`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n ** 2`, which will cause the loop to terminate. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to indicate that it has reached the end of the range.

Since there are no other variables that need to be adjusted based on the information provided (like `m` or `s`, which are not directly involved in the execution of this specific loop), we will keep the values of `m`, `s`, and `dp` unchanged.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is n ** 2 - 1**
