According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `k` as 3 and `s` as at least 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4, and `s` needs to be at least 4 to ensure the loop can continue.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 4**
