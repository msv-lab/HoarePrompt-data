The code snippet provided is an assignment operation that involves multi-dimensional indexing of a data structure `dp`. The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

In this context, the variables affected are `i`, `j`, and `k`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` would determine which specific indices of the `dp` array are being accessed. 

- `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, but since `n` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value. However, we know `i + 1` will be at least 2.
- `j` is given as 2, and since `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1), this is valid.
- `k` is 1.

The operation modifies the `dp` array at the indices based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since the operation does not change any of the values of `s`, `j`, `m`, `i`, `k`, or `dp`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
