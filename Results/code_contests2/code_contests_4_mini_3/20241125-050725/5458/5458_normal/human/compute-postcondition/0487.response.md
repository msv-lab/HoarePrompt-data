The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the remaining code inside the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same for the affected variables, but we note that we are continuing to the next iteration.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
