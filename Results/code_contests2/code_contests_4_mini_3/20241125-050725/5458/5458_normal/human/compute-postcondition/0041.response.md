According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop iterates `j` from 1 to `m`, meaning that for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 2, since the last valid value of `j` in the previous iteration must have been `m`. 

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that the loop has already executed for `j = m`, to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `m + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 2.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`**
