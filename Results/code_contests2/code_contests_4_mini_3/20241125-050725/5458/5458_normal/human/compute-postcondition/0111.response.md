According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `i`, which ranges from 0 to `n ** 2 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be less than `n ** 2` for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is updated in the loop, it will increment by 1 for each iteration.

Since `i` is currently at its value at the end of the last iteration, to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to `i + 1`. Thus, if `i` was at its maximum value of `n ** 2 - 1`, for the loop to execute, `i` should now be `n ** 2`. 

No other states need to be adjusted, as `n`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by the loop's control variable `i` in this context.

State: **`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, where `i` is `n ** 2`, `j` and `k` remain unchanged.**
