Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1. There is no change to the state of `dp` if `j` is less than `k`.***
