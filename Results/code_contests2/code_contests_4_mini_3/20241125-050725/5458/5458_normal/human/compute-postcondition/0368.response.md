The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a data structure `dp`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to determine which specific element is being assigned the value of `1`.

1. **Impact of the code**:
   - The index `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate `i + 1` first. Since `i` is `0`, `i + 1` equals `1`. 
   - The bitwise AND operation `1 & 1` results in `1`.
   - The index for `j` is `j + 1`. Since `j` is `m + 1`, this index will be `m + 2`.
   - The index for `k` is simply `k`, which is `1`.

2. **Summary of affected variables**:
   - The index for `dp` is determined to be `[1][m + 2][1]`, and this entry in the `dp` array is assigned the value `1`.
   - The values of `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` are unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflecting the changes is:
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is assigned the value 1**.
