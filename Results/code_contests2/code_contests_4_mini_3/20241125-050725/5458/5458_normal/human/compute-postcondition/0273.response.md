Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is positive and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is positive and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring the `dp` array reflects the necessary state transitions based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
