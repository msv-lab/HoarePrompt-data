Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n`, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, both taken modulo `mod`. All modifications to `dp` take into account the constraints and initial values provided in the precondition.***
