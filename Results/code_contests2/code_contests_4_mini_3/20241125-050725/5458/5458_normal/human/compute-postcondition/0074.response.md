Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least `m + 1`, and `k` varies from 1 to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the `dp` array. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` added to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The loop will not execute if `s` is less than 1, in which case `k` will not be defined and `dp` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `j` is less than or equal to `k` for all iterations, the corresponding entries in `dp` may not get updated, reflecting that specific relationship between `j` and `k`.**
