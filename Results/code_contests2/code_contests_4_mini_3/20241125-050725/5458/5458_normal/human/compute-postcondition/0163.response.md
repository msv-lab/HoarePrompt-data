The line of code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` affects the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is even or odd. The variable `j` is incremented by 1, so `j + 1` will be 2. The variable `k` remains unchanged at 2.

The code assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `j` was 1 and becomes 2; `k` is 2 and remains unchanged; `i` is either 0 or a positive integer which affects the index accessed in `dp`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `s` is greater than or equal to 2,
- `dp` is unchanged,
- `j` is now 2,
- `k` is 2,
- `i` is either 0 or a positive integer.

Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 2, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer**
