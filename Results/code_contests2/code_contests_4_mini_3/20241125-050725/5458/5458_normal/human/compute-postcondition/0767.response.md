The code executes a `continue` statement, which causes the current iteration of a loop to be skipped, moving directly to the next iteration. No changes are made to the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k`, or `i`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values, but we note that the loop iteration continues. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with the value from [i + 1 & 1][j][k], `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
