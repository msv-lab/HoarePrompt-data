The `continue` statement does not modify the values of any variables or affect their states; it simply causes the program to skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions of the variables as they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
