According to the code, the loop is a `while 1` loop, which means it is an infinite loop and will continue to execute indefinitely as long as the program is running. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1; `dp` has been updated based on the loop execution, and the function prints `dp[n]`**
