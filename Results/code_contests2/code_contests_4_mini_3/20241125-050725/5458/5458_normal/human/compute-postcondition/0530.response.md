The execution of the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the remainder of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, reflecting the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
