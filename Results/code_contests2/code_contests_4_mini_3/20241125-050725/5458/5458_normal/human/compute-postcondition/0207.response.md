The statement `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since the values of `s`, `k`, and the `dp` array remain unaffected by the `continue` statement, we note that the loop continues without any changes to these variables.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and the `dp` array remains unchanged; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
