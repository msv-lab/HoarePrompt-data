Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. For the case where `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All updates are done modulo `mod`, ensuring the values remain within the bounds defined by the modulo operation.***
