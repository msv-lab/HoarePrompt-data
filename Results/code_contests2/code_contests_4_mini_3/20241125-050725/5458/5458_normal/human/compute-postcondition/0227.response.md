Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is a positive integer larger than 0, and if `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1), the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made, and the program moves past this block.***
