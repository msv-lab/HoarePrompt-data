According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` in relation to `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4. Additionally, since `k` is now set to 4, `s` must be greater than or equal to 4 to ensure the loop can continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is 4**
