Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, this block of code does not execute, and the program proceeds to the next statement without any changes to the state related to `dp`.***
