The code updates the `dp` array at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `k` is defined as `s + 1`, but without the specific values of `i`, `j`, `s`, and `dp`, we cannot determine the exact state of `dp`. Therefore, the output state remains general, indicating that the update occurs but does not specify the contents of `dp`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with value from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
