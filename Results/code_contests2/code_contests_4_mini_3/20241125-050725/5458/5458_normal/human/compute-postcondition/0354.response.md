The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the multi-dimensional array `dp`. The specific indices being accessed are `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. The value at that specific index in `dp` is set to `1`. 

For the index `i + 1 & 1`, we need to evaluate the result of `i + 1 & 1`. 
- If `i` is 0, then `i + 1` is 1, and `1 & 1` gives us 1.
- If `i` is greater than 0 (1 or more), then `i + 1` will be 2 or more, and `2 & 1` gives us 0.

For the index `j + 1`, since `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `j + 1` will be at least 2.

The index `k` is fixed at 3.

Thus, the index `dp` will be modified as follows:
- If `i` is 0: `dp[1][j + 1][3] = 1`
- If `i` is greater than 0: `dp[0][j + 1][3] = 1`

The other variables `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state summarizing the values is as follows, including the modification to `dp` based on the scenarios for `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and `dp` is modified with either `dp[1][j + 1][3] = 1` if `i` is 0 or `dp[0][j + 1][3] = 1` if `i` is greater than 0**
