Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In the case where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` after applying modulus. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is thus determined based on the comparisons of `j` and `k`, reflecting the calculations made based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
