Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the state of `dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur to `dp`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. All conditions maintain their respective values throughout the execution.***
