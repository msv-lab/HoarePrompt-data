Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is either 0 or a positive integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is at least 2, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is 1, then if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated using the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it, which accounts for the case when `j` is equal to or less than `k`, ensuring all edge cases regarding the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are covered.***
