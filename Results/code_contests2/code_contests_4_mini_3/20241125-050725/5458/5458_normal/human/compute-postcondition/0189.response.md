The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `i` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
