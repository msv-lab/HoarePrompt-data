The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Since `i` is a positive integer, `i + 1` will also be a positive integer, and the bitwise operation `& 1` will result in either `0` or `1` based on whether `i + 1` is even or odd. The variable `j` is `m + 1`, which is greater than `1`, and `k` is `1`.

The state of the variables `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remains unchanged as the assignment operation does not affect their values.

Therefore, the output state is: `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and we assign the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and we assign `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`**
