The code snippet `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it affects the flow of execution by skipping the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the values of `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is an integer (either 0 or a positive integer), `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.**
