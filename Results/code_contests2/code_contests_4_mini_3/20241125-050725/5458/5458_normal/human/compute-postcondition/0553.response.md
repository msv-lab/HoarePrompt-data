Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring that all operations respect the modular condition and maintain the integrity of the dp array values.***
