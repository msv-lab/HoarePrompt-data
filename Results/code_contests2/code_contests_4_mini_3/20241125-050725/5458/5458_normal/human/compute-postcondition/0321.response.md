According to the code, the outer loop will iterate based on the variable `i` which ranges from `0` to `n ** 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 0, since the loop has executed `m` times. 

However, there are no specific values for `n` provided, and since `i` must be less than `n ** 2`, we should adjust `i` to be equal to its last value plus one, which means `i` will be incremented to `1`. The loop will only execute again if `i` remains less than `n ** 2`. 

Since we don't have further information about the values of `m` or `s`, we will assume they remain unchanged as we are only focusing on the loop iteration for `i`.

State: **`i` is 1** (and all other states `m` and `s` remain unchanged)
