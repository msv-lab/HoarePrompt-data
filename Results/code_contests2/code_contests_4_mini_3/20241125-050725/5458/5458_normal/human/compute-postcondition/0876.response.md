Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, if `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is at least 1, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no change to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. In the else block, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
