Postcondition: ***Given that `s` is at least 3 and `k` is 3, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on both `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring all calculations are taken modulo `mod`.***
