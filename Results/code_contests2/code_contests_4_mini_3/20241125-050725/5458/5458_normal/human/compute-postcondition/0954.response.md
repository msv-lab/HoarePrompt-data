According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will continue executing as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. The loop starts with `k` at 2 and will continue until it reaches `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3, and this means that `s` must be at least 3 to allow for this increment. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j` do not affect the loop execution itself in this context.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is 3**
