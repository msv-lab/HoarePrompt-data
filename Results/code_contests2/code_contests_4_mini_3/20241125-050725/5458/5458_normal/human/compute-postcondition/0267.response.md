Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, meaning `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 when `i` is 0, or `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 when `i` is a positive integer. This ensures that the state of the `dp` array is updated accordingly based on the value of `i` and the condition of `j` relative to `k`.***
