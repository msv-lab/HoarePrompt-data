According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 3, meaning that the loop has executed for values of `k` from `1` up to at least `3`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` must be incremented to `4`, and for the loop to be valid, `s` must be at least `4`. Therefore, we need to adjust `s` to be at least `4` so that the loop can execute again.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is 4**
