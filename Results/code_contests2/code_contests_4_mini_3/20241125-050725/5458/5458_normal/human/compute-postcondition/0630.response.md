Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` added to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Overall, the updates to `dp` depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, maintaining their constraints.***
