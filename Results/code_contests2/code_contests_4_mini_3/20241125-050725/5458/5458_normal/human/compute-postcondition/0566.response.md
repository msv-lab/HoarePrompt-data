The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns a value to a specific position in a 3D array `dp`. The value being assigned is taken from another position in the same array. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes the value of `i + 1` bitwise ANDed with `1`, which will yield either `0` or `1`. This means that `dp` will be accessed at either the index `0` or `1` for the first dimension.
2. The value of `j + 1` increments `j` by `1`, which suggests that it will access the next index in the second dimension of the `dp` array.
3. The variable `k` remains unchanged and continues to point to the same index in the third dimension during this operation.

Since we do not have specific values for `i`, `j`, or `k`, we can only state that the action affects the `dp` array at the specified indices, but we cannot determine the exact resulting state of `dp` without knowing the values at those indices. 

Therefore, the output state summarizes the situation without exact values for the indices:

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
