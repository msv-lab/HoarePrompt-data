The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 2, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
