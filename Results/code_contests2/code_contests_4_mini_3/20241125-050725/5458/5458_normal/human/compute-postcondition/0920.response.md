According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. The loop starts with `k` being 2 and increments `k` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `s`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 3 so that `k` can take on the value of 3 and the loop can continue executing.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `k` is changed to 3.
- `s` is adjusted to be at least 3 to allow the loop to run.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, and `k` is 3.**
