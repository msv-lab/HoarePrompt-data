The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the remainder of the current iteration of a loop, proceeding to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that no variables have been modified but indicates that we are continuing to the next iteration.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
