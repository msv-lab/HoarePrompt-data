Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program also continues to the next iteration.***
