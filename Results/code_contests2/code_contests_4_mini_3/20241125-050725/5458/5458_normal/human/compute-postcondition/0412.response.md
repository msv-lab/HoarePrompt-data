According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop iterates over `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2, and it is necessary for `s` to be at least 2 in order for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `k` is now 2 and that `s` is at least 2.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m`, and `k` is 2**
