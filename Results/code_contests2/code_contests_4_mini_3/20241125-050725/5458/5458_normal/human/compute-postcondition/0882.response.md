Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program moves past this statement without any changes to the values of `dp` or the variables.***
