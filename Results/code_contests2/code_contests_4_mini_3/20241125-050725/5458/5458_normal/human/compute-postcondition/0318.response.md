Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k` for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The loop executes `s` times if `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `s` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. All edge cases regarding the relationships between `j` and `k` are handled.**
