Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `j` is greater than 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. There is no change in the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` in this case.***
