The code assigns a new value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is derived from the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Since `j` is less than `m` and `k` is 3, we must check if `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, as stated, no changes to `dp` occur. Thus, the output state remains unaffected for `dp`.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 3, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 3, and no changes to `dp` occur.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 3, and no changes to `dp` occur.**
