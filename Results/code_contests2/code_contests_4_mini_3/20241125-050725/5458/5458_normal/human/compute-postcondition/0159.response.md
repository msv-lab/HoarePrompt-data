Postcondition: ***`s` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is either 0 or a positive integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to `dp`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, the values of `dp` depend on the specific values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod`, but the conditions outlined above will dictate the changes made to `dp`.***
