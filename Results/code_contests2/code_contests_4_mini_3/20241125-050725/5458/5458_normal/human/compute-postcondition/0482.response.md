Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, and if `i` is equal to 0, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring that `dp` reflects the appropriate changes based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
