The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but skips the current iteration of the loop in which it is located. As a result, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
