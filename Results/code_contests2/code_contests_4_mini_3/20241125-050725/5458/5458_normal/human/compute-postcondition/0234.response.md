The code assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific values of `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` do not affect this operation since they are not directly involved in the assignment. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers with `i` being either 0 or a positive integer, `j` being at least 1, and `k` being at least 2. The state of the other variables (`m` and `s`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged variables and the assignment operation.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is an integer (either 0 or a positive integer), `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
