Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, none of these updates occur, and the program does not alter the state of `dp` or the loop iteration.***
