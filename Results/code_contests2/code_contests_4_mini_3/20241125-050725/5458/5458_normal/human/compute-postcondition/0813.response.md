The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This means that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` taken modulo `mod`. The previous state of `dp` at the specified indices influences this operation, but without the specific values of `dp`, we can only describe the impact in terms of changes made.

Therefore, the output state reflects the state of `s`, `n`, `m`, `j`, and `k`, along with the update made to the `dp` array.

Output State: **`s`, `n`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is less than `m` and at least 1; `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
