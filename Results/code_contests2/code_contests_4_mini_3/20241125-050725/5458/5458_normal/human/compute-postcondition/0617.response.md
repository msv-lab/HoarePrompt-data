The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
