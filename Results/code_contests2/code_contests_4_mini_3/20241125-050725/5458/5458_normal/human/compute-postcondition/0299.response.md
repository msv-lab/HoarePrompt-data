According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` in the range from 1 to `s` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2. Additionally, since `s` is stated to be greater than or equal to 1, it must be at least 2 for the loop to continue executing. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]` is determined by the values of `i`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `m` is greater than or equal to 2**
