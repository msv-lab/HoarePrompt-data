Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute the if block, and the state remains unchanged. Thus, the overall effect depends on the condition of `j` relative to `k`.***
