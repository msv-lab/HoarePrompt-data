The operation updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. However, since the initial state mentions that if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the if block, we conclude that the assignment does not take place. Therefore, the values of `dp` remain unchanged in this context.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and the values of `dp` remain unchanged.**
