According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop runs from 1 to `s` (inclusive), so for it to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 4, allowing `k` to be updated to 4 in the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, meaning the next iteration will be for `k = 4`. 

Therefore, the state `s` must be adjusted to be at least 4 to allow for `k` to increment to 4. Since `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is equal to `m`, there are no further adjustments required for those variables.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `m`, and `k` is 4**
