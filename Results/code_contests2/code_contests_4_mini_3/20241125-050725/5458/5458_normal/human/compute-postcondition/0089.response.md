According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is at least 1 (since the loop starts at 1) and `s` is at least 1 as well. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is less than `s` at the start of the next iteration. Since `k` is at least 1, in order for the loop to run again, we need to adjust `k` to be at least 2, and `s` must be at least 2 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2, and if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
