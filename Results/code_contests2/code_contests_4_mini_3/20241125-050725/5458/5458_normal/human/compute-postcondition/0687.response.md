According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 (the starting value of the loop), and since `m` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute as long as `j` remains less than or equal to `m`.

After the last iteration, `j` would be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, `m` needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) filled with zeros.**
