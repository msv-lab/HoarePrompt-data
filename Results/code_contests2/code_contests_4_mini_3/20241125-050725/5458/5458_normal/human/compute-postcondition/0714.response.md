The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables without alteration.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
