Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring all cases where `j` is equal to or less than `k` are handled. If none of these conditions hold, the values of `dp` remain unchanged, but the computation modifies `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on previous values of `dp` and the defined operations.***
