The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `s`, `j`, `m`, `i`, and `k` are not directly affected by the assignment. However, we note that `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `j` while noting the unchanged state of the others.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n`, and `k` is 2**
