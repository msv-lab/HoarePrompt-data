Output State: **If n is at least 1, m is at least 1, and s is at least 1, then dp will be updated based on the values of i (ranging from 0 to n^2 - 1), j (ranging from 1 to m), and k (ranging from 1 to s). If i is 0 and j >= k, then dp[1][j + 1][k] will be set to 1. If i > 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will equal dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If j <= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be calculated based on previous values of dp, considering the modulo condition. If any of n, m, or s is less than 1, the loops will not execute, and dp will remain unchanged. An edge case occurs if k - j is negative when accessing dp[i & 1][j][k - j], which requires handling to avoid invalid memory access.**
