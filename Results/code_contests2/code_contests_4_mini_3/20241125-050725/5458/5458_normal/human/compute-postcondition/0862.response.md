According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value (which is the last value it took in the loop), and `n` remains at least 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. Thus, if `i` was `n ** 2 - 1` (the last valid index), it must be adjusted to `n ** 2`, which means the loop will not execute again because `i` would be equal to `n ** 2`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n ** 2 - 1` to allow the loop to run once more.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is `n ** 2 - 1`**
