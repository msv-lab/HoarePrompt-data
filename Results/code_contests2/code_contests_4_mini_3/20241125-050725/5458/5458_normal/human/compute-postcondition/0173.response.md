The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the execution will jump to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
