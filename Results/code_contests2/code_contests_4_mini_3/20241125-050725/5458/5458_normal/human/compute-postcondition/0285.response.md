According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. Since the loop starts at `j = 1` and iterates up to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 (the loop will execute with `j` incrementing in subsequent iterations). To execute one more time, `j` should be adjusted to 2, and it should be ensured that `m` is greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to be able to proceed.

Since there are no other adjustments needed for `i` or `k` based on the provided conditions, we will not change those values. 

State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][2][k]` depends on the values of `i`, `k`, and `m` is greater than or equal to 2**
