Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to the value of `dp[1][j][2]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no change to the `dp` array in this block.***
