The code contains a `continue` statement, which will skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp` remains unchanged while we continue to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp` remains unchanged while we continue to the next iteration.**
