The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but we know:

- `i + 1 & 1` will yield either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is even or odd.
- `j` is greater than 1, so `j + 1` is at least 3.
- `k` is 1.

The state of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`) remains unaffected by this operation.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 1; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
