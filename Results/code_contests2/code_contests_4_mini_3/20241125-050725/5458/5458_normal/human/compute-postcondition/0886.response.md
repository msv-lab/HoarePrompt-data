According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which takes values from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 2, and `s` is at least 2. In order for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be adjusted to be 2 (the next value in the range) and `s` must remain at least 2. 

Therefore, the state needs to be modified to reflect this change in `k`.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 2**
