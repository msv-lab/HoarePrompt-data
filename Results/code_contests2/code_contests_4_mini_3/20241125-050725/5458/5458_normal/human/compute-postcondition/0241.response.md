The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` indicates that the value at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` of a 3-dimensional list (or array) named `dp` is being assigned the value `1`. 

1. The calculation `i + 1 & 1` is performed to determine the first index. The bitwise AND operation `&` will yield `0` or `1` based on the value of `i`:
   - If `i` is `0`, `i + 1` equals `1`, and `1 & 1` equals `1`.
   - If `i` is any positive integer, `i + 1` will be at least `2`, and `2 & 1` equals `0`. 
   Thus, the first index is either `0` or `1`, depending on whether `i` is `0` or a positive integer.

2. The second index is determined by `j + 1`, which will always be at least `2` since `j` is at least `1`.

3. The third index is simply `k`, which is `2`.

This means that after executing the code, we are updating the `dp` array at either `dp[0][j + 1][2]` or `dp[1][j + 1][2]` to be `1`, depending on the value of `i`. The values of `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not altered by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state is represented as follows:
- `m` is at least `1`
- `s` is at least `1`
- `i` is either `0` or a positive integer
- `j` is at least `1`
- `k` is `2`
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
