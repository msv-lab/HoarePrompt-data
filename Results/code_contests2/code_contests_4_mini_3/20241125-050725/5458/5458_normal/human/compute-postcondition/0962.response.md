Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the value derived from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, ensuring that all values reflect the current state of `dp`, and that the operation respects the modulo defined by `mod`.***
