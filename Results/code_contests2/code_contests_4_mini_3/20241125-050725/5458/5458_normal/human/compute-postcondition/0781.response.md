According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have the following states: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 2, it is possible for the loop to execute again because we need `s` to be at least 3 for the next iteration (assuming the minimum condition of `s` is met, which is greater than or equal to 2).

Thus, `k` needs to be increased to 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3.**
