According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` in relation to `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, which means we need to ensure that `k` is less than `s`. Hence, the condition must reflect that `k` is now in the range that allows for another iteration.

Thus, if `k` is currently equal to 2, then for the loop to iterate again, `s` must be at least 3, otherwise if `k` is less than `s`, we can simply increment `k` by 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3**
