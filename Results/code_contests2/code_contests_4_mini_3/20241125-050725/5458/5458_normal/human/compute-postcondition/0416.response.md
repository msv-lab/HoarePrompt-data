The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for all variables. 

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m`, `k` is 2, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` remain unaffected**.
