The code updates `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `k` is `1`, and `s` remains unchanged. The specific values of `i` and `j` are not provided, but the state of `dp` is modified based on these indices. The previous values of `dp` are not known, so we cannot determine the exact change. However, the output state reflects that `dp` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, where `k` is 1 and `s` remains unchanged**
