Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, `j` is at least 1, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `k` remains undefined, while `dp` values are unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on previous states, respecting the modulo condition.**
