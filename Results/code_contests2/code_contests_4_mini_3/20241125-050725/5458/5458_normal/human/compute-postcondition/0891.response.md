Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made, and the program continues with the current state of the variables.***
