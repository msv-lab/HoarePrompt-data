Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, ensuring the structure of `dp` is maintained.***
