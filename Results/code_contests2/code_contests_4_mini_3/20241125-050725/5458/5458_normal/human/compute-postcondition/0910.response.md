Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In the case where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and additionally `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` incorporates the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Edge cases include when `j` equals `k`, where the update depends solely on the `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` value, and when `j` is less than `k`, where the calculation considers both previous states of `dp`.***
