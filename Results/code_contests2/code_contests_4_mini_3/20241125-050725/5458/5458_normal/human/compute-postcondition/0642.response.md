According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we do not have a specific value for `j`, but we know that it must be less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute again.

If `j` is currently at its maximum value of `m`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least `j + 1`. 

Since `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `m`, for the next iteration, `j` will increment by 1. Therefore, `j` will need to be adjusted to `j + 1`, which would be `2` after the first iteration. We also need to ensure that `m` is at least `2` to allow for this adjustment.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
