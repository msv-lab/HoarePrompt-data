The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next step in the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration or step in the program.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration or step in the program.**
