Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n`, and `k` is 3; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there are no changes made to `dp` or the loop iteration.**
