The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` affect the indexing of the `dp` array, but since `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is 1, the indexing remains valid. The state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is preserved in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Other variables (`s` and `m`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the assignment operation.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
