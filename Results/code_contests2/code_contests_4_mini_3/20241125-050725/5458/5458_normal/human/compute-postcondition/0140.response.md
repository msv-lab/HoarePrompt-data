Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` (where `k` is 1) if `j` is greater than 1. In this case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][1]`. The variable `s` remains unchanged, and if `j` is less than or equal to 1, there is no update to `dp`.***
