According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Additionally, since `s` is at least 1, `s` must also be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing. 

No other states need to be adjusted. Thus, the modified state can be presented as follows:

State: **`s` is at least 3, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is 3**
