According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, which means that the loop has executed once. To allow the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. Additionally, `m` must be adjusted to ensure that it is at least 2 to allow for this increment. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be 2,
- `m` should be at least 2.

The other states (`s`, `dp`, `i`, `k`, and `mod`) do not need to be explicitly adjusted based on the information given for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is 2, `k` is not defined, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, `m` is at least 2**
