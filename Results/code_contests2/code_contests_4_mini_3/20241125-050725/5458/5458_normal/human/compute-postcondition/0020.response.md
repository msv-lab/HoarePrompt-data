Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) and each inner list is of size (s + 1). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` array. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` while taking modulo into account. The overall state of the `dp` array reflects these updates.***
