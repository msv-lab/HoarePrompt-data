Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is updated to be equal to `dp[1][j][2]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is updated based on `dp[1][j][2] % mod` and the value of `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod` is added accordingly. The state of the `dp` array reflects these updates based on the conditions of `i` and `j`.***
