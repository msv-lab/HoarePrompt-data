Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute any statements related to this condition.***
