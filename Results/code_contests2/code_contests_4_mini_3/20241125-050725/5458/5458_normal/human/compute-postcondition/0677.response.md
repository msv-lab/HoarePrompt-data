The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` affects the 2D list `dp`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to the result of adding 1 to `i` and performing a bitwise AND operation with 1. Since `i` is initially 0, `i + 1` equals 1, and `1 & 1` results in 1. Therefore, the first index of `dp` accessed will be 1.

The index `j + 1` is also evaluated, and since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is at least 1, `j + 1` will be at least 2.

The index `k` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `s - 1`.

Assuming `k` is within the bounds of the dimensions of `dp`, the code sets the value at `dp[1][j + 1][k]` to 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and the rest of the `dp` array) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) filled with zeros except `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `s - 1**
