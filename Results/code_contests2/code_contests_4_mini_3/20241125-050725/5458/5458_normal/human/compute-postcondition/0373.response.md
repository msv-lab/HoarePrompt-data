The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and the assignment statement has not been executed due to the `continue`.

Output State: **`i` is not equal to 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and the assignment statement has not been executed.**
