Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `k`, and `s`, where `k` equals `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp` in this iteration.***
