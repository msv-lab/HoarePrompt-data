The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
