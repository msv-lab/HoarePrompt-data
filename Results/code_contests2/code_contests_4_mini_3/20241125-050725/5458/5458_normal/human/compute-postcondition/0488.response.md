Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not enter the if block, and the state of `dp` may be updated based on other conditions outside this fragment. The conditions ensure that the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` respect the boundaries defined, and all operations maintain the necessary relationships among the variables.***
