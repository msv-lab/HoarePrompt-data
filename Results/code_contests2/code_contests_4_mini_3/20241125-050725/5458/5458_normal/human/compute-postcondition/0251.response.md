According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `m`. The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time. 

Given the state:
- `m` is at least 1 (ensuring that there is at least one iteration possible).
- `j` is at least 1, which means it could be equal to `m` or less than `m`.
  
To allow for one more iteration of the loop:
- If `j` is currently equal to `m`, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be incremented to `m + 1`, and `j` will then take the value `m + 1` in the next iteration. 

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted so that `j` is now `m + 1`.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s`.**
