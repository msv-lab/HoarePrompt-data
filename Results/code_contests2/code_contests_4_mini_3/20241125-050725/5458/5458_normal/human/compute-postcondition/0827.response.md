According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. The variable `k` starts at 1 in the first iteration of the loop.

The current state indicates that `k` is unchanged, which means it will take the value from the loop. So, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute, and when the loop starts, `k` will be 1.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` is 1**
