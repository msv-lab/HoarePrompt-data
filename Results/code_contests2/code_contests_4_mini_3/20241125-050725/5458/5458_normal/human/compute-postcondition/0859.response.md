Output State: **`if s is at least 1 then k is the last value in the range from 1 to s. If i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for the first iteration. If i is not 0 and j is greater than k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If j is less than or equal to k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed using previous values of `dp` with modulo operations. If s is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and the values of `k`, `dp`, and the other variables remain unchanged, with `dp` retaining its initial state.**
