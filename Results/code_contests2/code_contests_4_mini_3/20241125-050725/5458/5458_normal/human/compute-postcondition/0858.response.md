According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4. Additionally, since `s` is at least 3, it ensures that the loop can still execute as long as `s` is equal to or greater than 4.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `k` is now 4 and `s` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, and `k` is 4**
