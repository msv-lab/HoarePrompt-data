The statement `continue` indicates that the program will skip the remainder of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `s`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `i`, and the state of `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop continues without any changes to the existing variables.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `i` is at least 1, and the state of `dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
