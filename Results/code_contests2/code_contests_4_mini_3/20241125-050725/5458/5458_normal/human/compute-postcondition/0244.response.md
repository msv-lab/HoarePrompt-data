The code `continue` is used within a loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one. It does not change the values of any variables, and the previous states of the affected variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the note that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is an integer (either 0 or a positive integer), `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
