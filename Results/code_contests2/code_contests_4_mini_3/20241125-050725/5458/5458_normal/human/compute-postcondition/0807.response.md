The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` is an assignment that updates the value of `dp` at the specified indices. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are involved in indexing into the `dp` array. Given the initial state, we know:

- `s` is at least 1
- `n` is at least 1
- `m` is at least 1
- `j` is less than `m`
- `k` is 2

The impact of the code is as follows:

- The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to the result of adding 1 to `i`, then performing a bitwise AND with 1. This will either yield 0 or 1, depending on whether `i` is even or odd.
- The index `j + 1` will be used directly, which is valid since `j` is less than `m` and `m` is at least 1, making `j + 1` at least 1.
- The variable `k` is given as 2, which is a straightforward index here.

Thus, `dp` at the calculated indices will be updated to 1. The other variables `s`, `n`, `m`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**.
