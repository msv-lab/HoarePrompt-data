Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is greater than 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop iteration continues to the next cycle. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in the values of `dp`, and the program proceeds without executing the if block.***
