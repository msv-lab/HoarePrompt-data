Postcondition: ***`s`, `n`, `m` are at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All updates to the `dp` matrix are performed modulo `mod`.***
