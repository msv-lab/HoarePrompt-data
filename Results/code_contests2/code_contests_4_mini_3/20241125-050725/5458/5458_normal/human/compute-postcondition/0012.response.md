Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) and each inner list is of size (s + 1), `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` array.***
