The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a data structure `dp` based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The operation `i + 1 & 1` will determine which index to use for the first dimension of the `dp` array. Since `i` is at least 1, `i + 1` will be at least 2, and `2 & 1` results in `0`. Thus, the first index will always be `0` in this case.
  
2. The second index is `j + 1`, and since `j` is greater than 1, `j + 1` will be at least 3.

3. The third index is simply `k`, which is `1`.

Therefore, the expression effectively becomes:
```
dp[0][j + 1][1] = dp[0][j][1]
```

This means that the value at `dp[0][j + 1][1]` is set to the value of `dp[0][j][1]`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not modified by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1; dp[0][j + 1][1] is assigned the value of dp[0][j][1]**
