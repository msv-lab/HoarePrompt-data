The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the current iteration of the loop in which it resides. As a result, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
