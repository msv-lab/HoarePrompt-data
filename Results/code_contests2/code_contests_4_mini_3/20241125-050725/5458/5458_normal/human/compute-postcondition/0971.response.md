Output State: **The loop will execute repeatedly, updating `dp` based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `s` provided in each iteration. If `n`, `m`, or `s` is 0, the loop will terminate, and no updates to `dp` will occur, maintaining its values as initially set. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all positive, the loop will continue to execute until a line containing "0 0 0" is input, at which point the output will be `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`. If the input is invalid (i.e., if `n` is less than 1 or greater than 7, `m` is less than 1 or greater than 2000, or `s` is less than 1 or greater than 3000), the program does not handle these cases explicitly and will proceed with whatever values are provided, potentially causing unexpected behavior.**
