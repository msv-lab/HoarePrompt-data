According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4, and `s` must be at least 4 to ensure the loop can run.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 4**
