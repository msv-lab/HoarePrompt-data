Output State: **If `s` is at least 1, the loop executes `s` times, and `k` will take values from 1 to `s`. After the loop, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 for each `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains its previous value. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then it computes based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `s` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp` values remain unchanged.**
