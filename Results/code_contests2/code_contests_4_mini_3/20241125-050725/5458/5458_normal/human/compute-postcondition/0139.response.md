The code `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and move to the next iteration. As a result, the values of the variables `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is updated based on `i`, `j`, and `k` (where `k` is 1), and `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is updated based on `i`, `j`, and `k` (where `k` is 1), and `s` remains unchanged**
