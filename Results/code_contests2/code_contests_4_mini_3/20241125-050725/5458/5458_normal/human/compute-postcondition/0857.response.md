Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In cases where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, with all operations done modulo `mod`. Overall, the program modifies `dp` based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`, ensuring proper updates according to the provided logic while maintaining the initial constraints for the variables.***
