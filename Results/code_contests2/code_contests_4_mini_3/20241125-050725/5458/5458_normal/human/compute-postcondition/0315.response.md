Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
