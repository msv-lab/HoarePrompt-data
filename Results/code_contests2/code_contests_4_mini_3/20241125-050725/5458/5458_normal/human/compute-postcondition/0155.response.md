The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
