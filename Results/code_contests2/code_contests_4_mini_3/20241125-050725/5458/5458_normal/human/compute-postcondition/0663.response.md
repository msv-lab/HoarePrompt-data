Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) filled with zeros, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and execution continues normally.***
