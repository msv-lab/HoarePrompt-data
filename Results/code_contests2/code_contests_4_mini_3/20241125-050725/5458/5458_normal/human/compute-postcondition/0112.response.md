According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. The variable `j` will start from 1 at the beginning of the loop. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
