Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no updates are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds to the next line of code or next iteration. This ensures that the state of the program properly reflects the condition of `j` in relation to `k`.***
