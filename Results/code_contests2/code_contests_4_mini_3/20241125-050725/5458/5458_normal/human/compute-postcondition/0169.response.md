According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the value of `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop runs from `k = 1` to `k = s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, indicating that the loop has executed for at least `k = 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to the next value, which would be `k = 2`. Therefore, the state of `k` must be adjusted to reflect this increment.

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2**
