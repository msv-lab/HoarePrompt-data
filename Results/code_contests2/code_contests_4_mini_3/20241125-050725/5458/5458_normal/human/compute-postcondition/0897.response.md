According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute for values of `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1 and at most `m`, meaning `j` can take on the value of `m` in the last iteration. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented to `j + 1`, and since `j` is currently at most `m`, it must also be ensured that `j + 1` does not exceed `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to `j + 1`, and it must be ensured that `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`. 

Since `j` is at least 1 and at most `m`, `j + 1` will be at least 2 and at most `m + 1`. Therefore, `m` must be adjusted to be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is the final value, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, and `k` is between 1 and `s`.**
