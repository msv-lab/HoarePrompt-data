According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `j` will be initialized to 1 at the beginning of the loop. The variable `i` being equal to `n` does not affect the execution of the loop in this context.

Thus, the states that need to be considered are:
1. `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
2. `j` should start at 1, as that is the initial value when the loop begins.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is n, `j` is 1**
