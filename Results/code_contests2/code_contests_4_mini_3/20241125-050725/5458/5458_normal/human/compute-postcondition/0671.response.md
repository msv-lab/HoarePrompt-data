The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables directly. Instead, it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, and `dp` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `k` is less than or equal to `s and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
