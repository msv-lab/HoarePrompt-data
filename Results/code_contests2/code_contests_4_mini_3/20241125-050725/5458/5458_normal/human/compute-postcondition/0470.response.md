According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it will execute for each integer value starting from 1 up to and including `s`. 

Given that `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `k` will start at 1 during the first iteration. There are no additional adjustments needed for `j` and `m` as they do not affect the loop's execution.

Thus, the states that need to be accounted for are that `k` starts at 1 and `s` is still at least 1.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `2`, `k` is 1**
