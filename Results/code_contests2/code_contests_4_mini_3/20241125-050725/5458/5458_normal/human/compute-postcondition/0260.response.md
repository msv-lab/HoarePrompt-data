The code contains a `continue` statement, which means that it will skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, the values of the variables themselves do not change due to the `continue` statement. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
