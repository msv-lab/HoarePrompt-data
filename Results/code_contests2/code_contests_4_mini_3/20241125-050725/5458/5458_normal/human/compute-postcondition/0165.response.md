Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 2, `dp` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop without modifying `dp`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the if block, and the values of `dp`, `j`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
