Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is an integer (either 0 or a positive integer), `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute the if block and moves on without any modifications to `dp`.***
