To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `m` is at least 1
- `s` is at least 1
- `i` is an integer (either 0 or a positive integer)
- `j` is at least 1
- `k` is 2

### For Loop Statement:
```
for k in xrange(1, s + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop iterates `k` from `1` to `s`, inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`.

2. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 2. To allow the loop to run again, `k` must now be updated to the next integer value, which would be 3.

3. Since `s` is at least 1, we do not know its exact value, but `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute with `k` set to 3. If `s` were less than 3, the loop would not execute again.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `k` must be updated to 3 for the next iteration.
- The state of `s` must be adjusted to at least 3 to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `i` is an integer (either 0 or a positive integer), `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3**
