Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `k`, and `s` such that if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the iteration continues; since `j` is initialized to 1 and `k` is 1, the condition `j > k` will not hold true, thus this block will not execute. Therefore, no modifications are made to `dp` in this case. The preconditions ensure that `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to 1, and `i` is not equal to 0, further confirming the stability of the state of `dp` after execution.***
