The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with value from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with value from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
