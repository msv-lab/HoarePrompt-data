The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables directly. Instead, it is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but the execution will skip to the next iteration in the loop where this `continue` statement was executed. 

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
