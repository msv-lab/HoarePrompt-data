According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` from 1 to `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` can take on a value that is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, ensuring that it still remains within the range specified by `s`. Since `s` is at least 2, this condition is satisfied.

No other states need to be adjusted as `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j` do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 2**
