Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][4][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][4][k]` is updated to `dp[1][3][k]`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][4][k]` is updated to `dp[1][3][k] % mod + dp[0][3][k - j] % mod`, ensuring the updates respect the modulo operation.***
