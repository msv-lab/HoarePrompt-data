The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
