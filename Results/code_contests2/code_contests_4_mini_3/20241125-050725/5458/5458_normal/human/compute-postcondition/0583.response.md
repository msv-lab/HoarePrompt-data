The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and notes that we continue to the next iteration. 

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
