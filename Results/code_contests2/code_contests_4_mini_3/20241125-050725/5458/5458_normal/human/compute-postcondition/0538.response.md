Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` will iterate from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is recalculated based on previous values. If `s` is less than 1 or `m` is less than 1, the outer loop does not execute, leaving `j` and `k` undefined, and `dp` remains unchanged for all indices. If `i` is less than 0, the logic for updating `dp` is not executed, indicating a potential edge case.**
