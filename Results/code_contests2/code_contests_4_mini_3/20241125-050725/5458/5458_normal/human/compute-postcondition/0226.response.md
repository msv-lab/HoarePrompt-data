The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and since no specific loop context is provided, we assume we are inside a loop. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is a positive integer larger than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is a positive integer larger than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
