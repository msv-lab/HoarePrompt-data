The `continue` statement is encountered, which means that the current iteration of the loop will be skipped, and the program will move on to the next iteration without executing any further code within the loop for this iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and the loop continues.
