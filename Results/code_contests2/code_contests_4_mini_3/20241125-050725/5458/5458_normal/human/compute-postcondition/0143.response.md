Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, where `k` is 1 and `s` remains unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][1]`. If `j` is less than or equal to 1, and `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is updated based on the modulo operation involving `dp[i & 1][j][0]`. In all cases, `k` remains 1 and `s` stays unchanged.***
