Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `k`, and `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged as it takes the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` plus the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The overall state of `dp` reflects these updates according to the conditions specified, ensuring all edge cases are addressed.***
