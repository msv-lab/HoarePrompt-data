The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
