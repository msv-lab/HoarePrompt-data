Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is an integer (either 0 or a positive integer), `j` is at least 1, and `k` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program proceeds without any modifications to `dp` and continues execution after the if statement.***
