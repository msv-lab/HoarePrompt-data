According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 since `n ** 2` must be greater than 0 for the loop to run. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 and will increment until it reaches `n ** 2 - 1`, meaning it will have `n ** 2` iterations.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
