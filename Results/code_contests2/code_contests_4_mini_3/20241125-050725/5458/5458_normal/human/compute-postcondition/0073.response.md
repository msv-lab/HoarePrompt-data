According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be adjusted to 4 since the next iteration will increment `k` by 1.

Additionally, `s` remains at least 3 since it was not stated that it changes during the loop.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 4**
