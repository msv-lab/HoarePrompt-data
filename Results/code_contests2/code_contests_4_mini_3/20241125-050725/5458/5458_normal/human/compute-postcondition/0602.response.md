Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not enter the if block, and no changes are made to `dp` or the loop iteration.***
