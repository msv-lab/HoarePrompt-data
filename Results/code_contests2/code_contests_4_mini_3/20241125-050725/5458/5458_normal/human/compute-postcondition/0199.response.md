Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, if `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without making any changes to `dp`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the body of the if statement and the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
