According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `s`, which determines the upper limit of the range for `k`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1, which is satisfied since `s` is at least 1. The variable `k` will start at 1 and increment until it reaches `s + 1`. 

Since `k` is re-assigned within the loop header, its initial value before the loop starts is irrelevant, as it will be set to 1 when the loop begins. The current state of `j`, `m`, and `k` before the loop does not affect the execution of the loop itself, as the loop will control `k`. 

Thus, the necessary state for the loop to execute is that `s` is at least 1, and `k` will start from 1 when the loop begins.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
