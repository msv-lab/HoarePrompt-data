The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the loop in which it is executed. The values of `s`, `j`, `m`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n`, `k` is 3, and the loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n`, `k` is 3, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
