Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is updated by adding `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][3]` remains unchanged.***
