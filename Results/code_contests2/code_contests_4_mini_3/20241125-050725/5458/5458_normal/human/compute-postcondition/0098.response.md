According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` from 1 to `s`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is at least 2, and `s` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented to 3, and `s` must be at least 3 to allow for this increment.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, `i` is equal to 0**
