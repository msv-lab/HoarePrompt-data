According to the code, the loop executes for values of `j` ranging from 1 to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must allow for an additional iteration beyond the current value of `j`. Since `j` is at least 1 at the end of the last iteration, and it can take values up to `m`, we want to ensure that `j` can continue to increment. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variables are as follows:
- `s` is at least 1 (which allows the loop to execute),
- `m` is at least 1,
- `j` is at least 1.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `m` to at least 2, so that `j` can increment to 2. Additionally, we need to adjust `j` to reflect the next value in the range, which will be `j + 1`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state accordingly:
- `m` needs to be at least 2 to allow the loop to run for `j = 2`.
- `j` should be adjusted to `2` (the next value).

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
