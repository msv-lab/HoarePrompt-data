Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes occur to the `dp` array in this fragment.***
