The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a data structure `dp`. The variables involved are `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, which is not equal to 0, so `i` has at least a value of 1.
2. The operation `i + 1 & 1` will yield 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i` (even or odd).
3. `j` is 1, which is greater than `k` (which is 1). Thus, `j + 1` will be 2.
4. `k` is 1.

So when we evaluate the indexing:
- `i + 1 & 1` yields either 0 or 1 (the exact value depends on whether `i` is odd or even).
- `j + 1` is 2.
- `k` is 1.

The right-hand side of the equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` will access a specific element of `dp` based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

The left-hand side `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will store the value from the right-hand side to a different position in the `dp` structure.

Overall, the values of `s`, `m`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, while `j` and `k` continue to hold their values. However, the structure `dp` is modified based on the calculations.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is n, `n` is not equal to 0, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp` is modified based on the operation.**
