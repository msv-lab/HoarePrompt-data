According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for `k` values ranging from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Since `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `k` would be equal to `s`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `k` starts at 1 and will iterate up to `s`.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is n, `k` is 1**
