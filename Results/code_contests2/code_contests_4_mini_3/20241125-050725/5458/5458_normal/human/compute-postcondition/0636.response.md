Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, we update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the condition is not satisfied, and no changes are made to `dp`.***
