Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) filled with zeros, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, where `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is between 1 and `s - 1` (inclusive).***
