Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` will iterate from 1 to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and the values of `dp` remain unchanged. If `j` is less than 1, the loop will also not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged.**
