Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. In the else part, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the previous states of `dp`, specifically taking into account modular arithmetic with `mod`. All modifications respect the conditions from the precondition and ensure the integrity of variable relationships.***
