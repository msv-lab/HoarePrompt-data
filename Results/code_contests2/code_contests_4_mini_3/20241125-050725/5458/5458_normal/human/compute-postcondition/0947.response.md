Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]` is set to 1, indicating that the specific index of the `dp` array has been modified. There is no change to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`.***
