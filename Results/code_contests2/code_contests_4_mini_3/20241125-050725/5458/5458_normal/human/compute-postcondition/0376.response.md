The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the specific values of `dp` are not provided. Thus, we can only describe the operation performed on `dp`.

Output State: **`i` is not equal to 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
