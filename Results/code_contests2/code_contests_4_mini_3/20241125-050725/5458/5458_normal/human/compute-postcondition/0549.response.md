The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop's current iteration and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement, but we proceed to the next iteration of the loop we are currently in.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
