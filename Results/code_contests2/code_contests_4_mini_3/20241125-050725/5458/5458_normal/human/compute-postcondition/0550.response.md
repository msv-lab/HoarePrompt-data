Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. There is no change to the state if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
