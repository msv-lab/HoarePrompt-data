Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration; if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the dp structure and the loop continues.***
