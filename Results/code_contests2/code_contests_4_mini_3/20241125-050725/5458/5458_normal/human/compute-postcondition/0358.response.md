Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues; otherwise, no change occurs as there is no else part. This ensures that the program can handle the case where `j` is exactly equal to `k` while proceeding with the loop only when `j` exceeds `k`.***
