According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is at least 1 and `m` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be adjusted to be at least 2, assuming it was 1 in the last iteration.

Thus, the next values would be:
- `j` should be increased to 2.
- Since `m` is at least 2, it can still be valid for `j` to be 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is at least 1**
