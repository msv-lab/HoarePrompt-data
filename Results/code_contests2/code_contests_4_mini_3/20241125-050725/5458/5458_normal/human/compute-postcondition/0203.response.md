According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented. Therefore, `k` should be adjusted to 3. The condition for the loop to execute again is satisfied as long as `s` is at least 3.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `k` is 3**
