Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2 and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. There is no change to the state of the program if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, and the program does not execute the update in that case.***
