Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 1, and if `i` is 0, then since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Thus, the final state of the program reflects these updates to the `dp` array based on the conditions evaluated.***
