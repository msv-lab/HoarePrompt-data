Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[1][3][1]` is also set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, covering the cases where `j` is equal to or less than `k`.***
