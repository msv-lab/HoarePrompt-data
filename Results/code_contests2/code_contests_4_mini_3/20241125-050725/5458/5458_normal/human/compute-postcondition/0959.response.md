Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.***
