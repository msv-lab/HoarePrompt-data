In the given initial state, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. We check if `j` is greater than `k`. Since `j = m + 1` and `k = 1`, if `m` is at least 1, `j` will indeed be greater than `k`. This means the assignment statement can be executed.

The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is not equal to 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
