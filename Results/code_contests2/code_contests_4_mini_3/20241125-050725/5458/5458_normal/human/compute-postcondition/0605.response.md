Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n`, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, thus reflecting all potential updates based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
