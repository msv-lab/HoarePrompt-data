According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the condition that it must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, which means `k` should be 2. Additionally, `k` must remain less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, `s` must be adjusted to at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `k` is 2**
