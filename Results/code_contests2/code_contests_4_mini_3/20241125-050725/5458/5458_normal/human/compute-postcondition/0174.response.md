Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 2 and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made, and the program proceeds according to the logic following this condition.***
