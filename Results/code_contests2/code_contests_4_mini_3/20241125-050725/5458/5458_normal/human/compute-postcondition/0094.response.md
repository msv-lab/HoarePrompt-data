Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged in this fragment, but the behavior of the program continues based on subsequent code not shown here. All conditions and values maintain their integrity as described in the precondition.***
