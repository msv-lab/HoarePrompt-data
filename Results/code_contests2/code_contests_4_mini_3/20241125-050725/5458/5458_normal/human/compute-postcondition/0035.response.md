Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is equal to `s - 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. There are no modifications to the state if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
