According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `s + 1`. Given that `s` is stated to be at least 1, the loop is set to execute. 

At the start of the loop, `k` will be initialized to 1, which is the first value in the range defined by `xrange(1, s + 1)`. The state of `i` and `j` does not affect the loop execution directly in this case, but we note their values for completeness.

Thus, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute are already satisfied, and the relevant states can be summarized as follows:

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
