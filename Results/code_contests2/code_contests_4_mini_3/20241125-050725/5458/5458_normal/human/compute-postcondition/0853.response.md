The statement `continue` is a control flow statement that causes the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop to end immediately and proceeds to the next iteration of that loop. However, the values of the variables themselves remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
