Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute any updates or continue, leaving the values of `dp` unchanged for this iteration.***
