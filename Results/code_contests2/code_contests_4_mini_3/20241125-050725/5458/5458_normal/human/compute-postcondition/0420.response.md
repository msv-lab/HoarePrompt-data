Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m`, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than 2, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` added to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, thus accounting for both cases of `j` being greater or less than or equal to `k`.***
