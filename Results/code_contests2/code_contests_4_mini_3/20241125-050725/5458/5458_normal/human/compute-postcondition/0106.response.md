Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, and `i` is equal to 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is updated to `dp[1][j][3]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is the remainder of `dp[1][j][3]` modulo `mod` plus `dp[0][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
