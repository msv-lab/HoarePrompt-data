Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `m`, and `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][3]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is updated with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][3] % mod` and also incorporates `dp[i & 1][j][3 - j] % mod`. The state of `dp` is modified based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
