Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute any action related to this condition.***
