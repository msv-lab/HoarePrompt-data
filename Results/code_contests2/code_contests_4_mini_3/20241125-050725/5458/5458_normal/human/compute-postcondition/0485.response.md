Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the appropriate updates to `dp` based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are ensured to maintain the integrity of the data structure, reflecting the necessary calculations.***
