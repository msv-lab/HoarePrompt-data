Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, leaving the state of `dp` otherwise unchanged. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, plus the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
