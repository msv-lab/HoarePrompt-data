Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` at index `[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` at index `[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged at 1 during these operations.***
