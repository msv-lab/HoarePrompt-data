Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. Additionally, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`.***
