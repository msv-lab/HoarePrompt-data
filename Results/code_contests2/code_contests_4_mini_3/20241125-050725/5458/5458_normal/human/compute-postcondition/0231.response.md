According to the code, the for loop iterates over the variable `k`, starting from 1 up to `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 1, and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1. Therefore, if the previous value of `k` is at least 1, we can adjust the state so that `k` becomes at least 2, and `s` remains unchanged, assuming `s` is at least 2.

Thus, the adjusted states would be:
- `k` should be updated to `k + 1` (which is at least 2).
- `s` remains at least 1.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is an integer (either 0 or a positive integer), `j` is at least 1, and `k` is at least 2**
