To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop and the states provided.

The provided state at the end of the previous iteration indicates:
- `s` is at least 3, which means the loop can potentially execute multiple times since the loop runs from `k = 1` to `k = s`.
- `k` is currently 3.

The loop iterates over `k` ranging from 1 to `s` (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s`. Since `k` is currently 3, we need to ensure that `s` is greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

Therefore:
- `s` must be greater than 3 to allow the next iteration of the loop (i.e., `k` would then be incremented to 4 in the next iteration).
- The current value of `k` should be updated to 4 for the next iteration.

Thus, the adjustments to the state are:
- `s` is at least 4 (to ensure the loop can continue).
- `k` is now 4 (to reflect the next value of `k` for the next iteration).

State: **`s` is at least 4, `k` is 4**
