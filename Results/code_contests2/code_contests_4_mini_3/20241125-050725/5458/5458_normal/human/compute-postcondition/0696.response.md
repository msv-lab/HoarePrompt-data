The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, it does not affect the values of any variables directly; it simply alters the flow of control in the program. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
