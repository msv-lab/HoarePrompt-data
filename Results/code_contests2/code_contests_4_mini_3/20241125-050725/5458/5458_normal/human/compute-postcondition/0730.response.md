The code contains a `continue` statement, which means that the current iteration of a loop will be skipped, and the control will move to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there are no variable assignments or modifications occurring in this specific code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
