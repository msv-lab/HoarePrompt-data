The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
