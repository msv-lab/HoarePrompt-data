The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified and only the flow of control is affected, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
