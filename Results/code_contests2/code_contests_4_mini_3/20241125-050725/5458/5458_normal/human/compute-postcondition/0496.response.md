The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values of the variables remain unchanged, and we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
