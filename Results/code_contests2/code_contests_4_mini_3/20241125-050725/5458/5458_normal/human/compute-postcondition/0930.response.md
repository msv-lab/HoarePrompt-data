Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, and `k` is between 1 and `s`. The loop executes `s` times, iterating over `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` keeps its previous value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The loop does not execute if `s` is less than 1, in which case `k` remains undefined, and `dp` does not get updated, leaving its previous state intact.**
