The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the 2D list `dp`. 

- The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1` if `i` is `0` (since `0 + 1 = 1` and `1 & 1 = 1`) and evaluates to `0` if `i` is `1` (since `1 + 1 = 2` and `2 & 1 = 0`). However, given the initial state where `i` is `0`, `i + 1 & 1` will be `1`.
- The expression `j + 1` will be `j + 1`, but the specific value of `j` is not given, only that it is greater than or equal to `k`. So, `j + 1` is at least `2` (since `k` is `1`).
- The value of `k` is `1`.

Since `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(2, m + 2)`, the indices used will be as follows:
- The first index will be `1` (from the evaluation of `i + 1 & 1`).
- The second index will be `j + 1`, which we know will be at least `2`.

Thus, the code assigns `1` to `dp[1][j + 1][1]`.

The output state remains focused on the values of the modified variables and the fact that `1` has been assigned to the specified index in `dp`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` has `1` assigned to `dp[1][j + 1][1]`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
