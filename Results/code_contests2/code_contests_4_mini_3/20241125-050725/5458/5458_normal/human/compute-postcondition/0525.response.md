Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated using the formula involving `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, ensuring that it remains within the bounds of the modulus operation.***
