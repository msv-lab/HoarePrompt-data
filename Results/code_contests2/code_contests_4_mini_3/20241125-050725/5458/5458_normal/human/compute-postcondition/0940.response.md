The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `j` is greater than `k`, and the value at `dp[0][4][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[0][3][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
