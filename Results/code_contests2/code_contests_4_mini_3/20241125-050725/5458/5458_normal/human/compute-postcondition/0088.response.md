Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 1, and if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures that all cases regarding the relationship between `j` and `k` are handled correctly, with appropriate updates to the `dp` array based on the conditions specified.***
