According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its last value before exiting the loop (which is `s` since the loop iterates from 1 to `s + 1`). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be set to `s + 1`, and the loop's condition must allow for that.

Since the loop is designed to start from `1` and go up to `s`, if `k` were to be `s + 1`, it means that in the next iteration, the loop would not execute as `k` would exceed `s`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `k` is currently `s + 1`.

State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `s + 1`**
