The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves array indexing and assignment. The operation `i + 1 & 1` calculates the value of `i + 1` and then performs a bitwise AND with `1`. Given that `i` is `0`, `i + 1` becomes `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`. Therefore, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be updated.

The variable `j` is `m + 1`, but since the value of `m` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `j + 1`. However, we know that `s` is at least `3` and `k` is `3`.

The output state reflects that the value of `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, but since we do not have the specific values of `j` and the contents of `dp`, we can only state the changes in terms of what is known.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[1][j][k]`**
