According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `k` is currently 1, and `s` is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2.

Since the loop iterates from `k = 1` to `k = s + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 2 (to allow `k` to take on the value 2). Therefore, `s` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 2, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `i` is either 0 or a positive integer.**
