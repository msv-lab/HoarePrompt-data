Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` when `j` is greater than `k`, where `k` is 2, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, this block of code does not execute, leaving `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` unchanged. Thus, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains determined by the previously defined values when `j` is not greater than `k`.***
