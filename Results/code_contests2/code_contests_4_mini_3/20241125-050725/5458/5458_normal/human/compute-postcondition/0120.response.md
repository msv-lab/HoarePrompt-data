The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` updates the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, `k`. The specific indices being accessed and modified in the `dp` array are determined by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

- The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes to either `0` or `1`, depending on the parity of `i`. 
- `j + 1` increments the value of `j` by 1, impacting the array access.
- The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is copied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which implies that the state of the `dp` array is modified for the new indices based on the current state of `dp` at the specified indices.

The values of `m` and `s` are not altered by this operation, and the states of `m`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state captures the changes made to `dp` and the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] based on [i + 1 & 1][j][k]; `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k`.**
