Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `dp` remains unchanged except for `dp[1][3][1]`, which is set to 1 if `j` (which is 2) is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1). Since `j` is always 2, this condition is always satisfied, and thus `dp[1][3][1]` will be set to 1. The values of `k`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged with `k` being 1, `i` being 0, and `m` being at least 2.***
