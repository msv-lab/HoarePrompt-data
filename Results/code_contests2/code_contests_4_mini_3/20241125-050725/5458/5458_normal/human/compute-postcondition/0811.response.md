Postcondition: ***`s`, `n`, `m` are at least 1, `j` is less than `m` and at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not modify the `dp` array, leaving it unchanged.***
