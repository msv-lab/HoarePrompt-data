According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, and since the loop should execute one more time, `m` must be at least 3. Additionally, `j` needs to be incremented to 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is between 1 and `s`.**
