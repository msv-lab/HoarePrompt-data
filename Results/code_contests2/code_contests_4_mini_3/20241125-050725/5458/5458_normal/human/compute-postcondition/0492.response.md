According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, to allow the loop to run again, `s` must also be adjusted to ensure it is at least 3.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 3**
