The code assigns `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Since `j` is greater than `k`, the assignment takes place. The previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are not specified, but the assignment updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the modulo value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
