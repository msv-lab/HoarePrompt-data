Output State: **If `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute for `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for each `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged at that index. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on values from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` while considering modulo. If `s` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged.**
