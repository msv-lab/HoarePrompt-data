Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1 & 1][2][k]` depends on the values of `i`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to 2, with `i` equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[1][j + 1][1]` remains unchanged.***
