According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2, and it must still satisfy the condition that `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, `s` should be at least 2 to allow for this increment.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2**
