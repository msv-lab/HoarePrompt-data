Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and if `j` is greater than 1, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while `dp` remains unchanged for other cases. If `j` is less than or equal to 1, the `dp` array remains unchanged.***
