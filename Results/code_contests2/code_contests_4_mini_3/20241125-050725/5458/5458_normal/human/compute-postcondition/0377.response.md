Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, maintaining the integrity of the `mod` operation. The overall state of the program reflects these conditions based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
