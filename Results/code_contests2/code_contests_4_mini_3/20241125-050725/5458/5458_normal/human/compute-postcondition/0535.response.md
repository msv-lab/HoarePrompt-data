To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the loop condition and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop iterates with `k` in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. The previous state indicates that `s` is at least 3, which means that `s + 1` is at least 4. Therefore, the loop can execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to at least 4.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` must have been at least 1 (since the loop starts at 1). If the last executed value of `k` was `3`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `4`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect this:

State: **`s` is at least 3, `k` is 4**
