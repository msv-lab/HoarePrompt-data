Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m`, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 1][1]` is set to 1, while all other elements of `dp` remain unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains entirely unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In all cases, the values of `dp` are influenced by the conditions on `i`, `j`, and `k`, and the modifications depend on the relationships among these variables.***
