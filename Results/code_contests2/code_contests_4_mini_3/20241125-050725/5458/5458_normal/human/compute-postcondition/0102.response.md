The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
