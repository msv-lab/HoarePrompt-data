According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 1, and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `s` is at least 1, it must be adjusted to at least 2 to ensure that the loop can execute again.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and if `i` is equal to 0, then since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
