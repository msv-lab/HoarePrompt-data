Postcondition: ***Given `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, taking into account that `k - j` could lead to an index that needs special handling if `j` is greater than `k`, ensuring that all updates respect the boundaries of the matrix.***
