According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `s`, since the loop will then be able to execute for the value of `k` equal to `s`.

No other states need to be adjusted because `n`, `i`, `m`, and `s` already satisfy their conditions to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is equal to `s`**
