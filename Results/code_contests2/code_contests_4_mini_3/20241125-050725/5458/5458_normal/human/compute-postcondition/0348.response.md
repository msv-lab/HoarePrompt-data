The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. It does not change the state of the variables directly, but it impacts the flow of execution. Since the variables are not modified by this statement, the output state remains the same as before the `continue` statement was executed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2; the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
