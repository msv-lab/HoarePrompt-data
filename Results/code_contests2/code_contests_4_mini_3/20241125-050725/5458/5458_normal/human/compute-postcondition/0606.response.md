According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute while `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 3 and `k` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4, which means `s` must be at least 4 to ensure that the upper limit of the range (`s + 1`) accommodates this new value of `k`.

Thus, we need to adjust `s` to be at least 4 to allow for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is at least 4, `j` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n`, and `k` is 4**
