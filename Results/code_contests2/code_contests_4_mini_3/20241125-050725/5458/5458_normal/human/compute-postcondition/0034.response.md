The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but skips the current iteration of the loop in which it is contained. Since `n`, `i`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, the output state reflects their existing values. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s - 1, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
