The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns a value to a specific index of a data structure, which appears to be a 3D list or array. The operation `i + 1 & 1` would evaluate to either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `i`. 

Given that `i` is 0, `i + 1` will be 1, and `1 & 1` evaluates to 1. Therefore, the assignment will refer to `dp[1][j + 1][k] = dp[1][j][k]`. 

The variable `j` is at least 1, so `j + 1` will be at least 2. The variable `k` is at least 2, so `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`.

Since we do not have the specific values of the `dp` array, the output state will reflect the operation without changing the absolute state of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, or `k`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`**
