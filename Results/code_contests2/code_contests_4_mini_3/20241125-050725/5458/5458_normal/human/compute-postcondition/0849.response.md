According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3, and `s` must be at least 3 to ensure that the range of the loop allows for that value of `k`. 

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `k` needs to be updated to 3.
- `s` needs to be updated to at least 3.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` is 3**
