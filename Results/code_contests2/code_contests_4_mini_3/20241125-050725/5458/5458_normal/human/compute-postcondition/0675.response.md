Postcondition: ***Given `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) filled with zeros, and `k` is less than or equal to `s`, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues without further modifications. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the sum of modulus of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The `dp` array is modified according to these conditions while maintaining all relationships among `n`, `m`, `k`, and `s`.***
