Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) filled with zeros, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is between 1 and `s - 1` inclusive. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the current iteration will proceed based on the next conditional logic outside of this block.***
