Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is equal to `s - 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
