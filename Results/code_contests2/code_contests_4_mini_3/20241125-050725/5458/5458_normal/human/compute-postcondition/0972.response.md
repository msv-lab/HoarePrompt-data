The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates based on three inputs: `n`, `m`, and `s`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, and `s` is an integer between 1 and 3000 inclusive. The function continues to process these inputs until the values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are all zero, at which point the input terminates.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle the inputs of `n`, `m`, and `s` according to the specified constraints and to terminate input processing when all three values are zero. 

Functionality: **The function accepts input values for n (1 to 7), m (1 to 2000), and s (1 to 3000) and continues processing until n, m, and s are all zero, at which point it terminates.**
