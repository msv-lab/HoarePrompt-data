The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the current iteration of a loop should be skipped, and the next iteration should begin. The values of `n`, `m`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is modified at specific indices, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is modified at specific indices, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
