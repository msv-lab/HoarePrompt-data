The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop, moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
