According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. Since the loop is set to run while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, we need to ensure that `k` is adjusted to be 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `s` is greater than or equal to 2, we can conclude that it meets the requirement for the loop to continue.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` needs to be incremented to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted because `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j` are sufficient for the loop to execute again based on the conditions provided.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1**
