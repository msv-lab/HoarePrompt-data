Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is modified based on the value of `i`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The value of `dp` remains unchanged for all other indices not affected by these operations.***
