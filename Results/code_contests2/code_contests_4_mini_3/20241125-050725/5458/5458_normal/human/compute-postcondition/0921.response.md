The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` updates the value in a 3D list or array `dp`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` performs a bitwise AND operation. 

1. If `i` is `0`, then `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`.
2. If `i` is `1`, then `i + 1` is `2`, and `2 & 1` results in `0`.

Thus, the first index of `dp` can either be `1` (if `i` is `0`) or `0` (if `i` is `1`).

The second index `j + 1` will always be at least `3` (since `j` is at least `2`).

The third index is always `k`, which is `3`.

Therefore, the impacted state depends on `i`:
- If `i` is `0`: `dp[1][j + 1][3] = 1`
- If `i` is `1`: `dp[0][j + 1][3] = 1`

The states of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, `k` is 3; `dp` is updated based on the value of `i`**.
