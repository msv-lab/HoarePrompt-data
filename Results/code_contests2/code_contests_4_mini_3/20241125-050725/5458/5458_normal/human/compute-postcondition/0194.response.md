According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted to 2 (the next integer after 1). Since the loop iterates starting from 1, `s` must also be at least 2 to allow for the next iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `s` is at least 2 and `k` is now 2.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `k` is 2**
