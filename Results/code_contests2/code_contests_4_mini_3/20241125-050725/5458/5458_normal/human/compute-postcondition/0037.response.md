Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s - 1`, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
