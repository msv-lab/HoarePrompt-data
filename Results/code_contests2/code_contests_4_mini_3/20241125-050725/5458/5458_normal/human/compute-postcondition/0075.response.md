According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `m`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is in the range from 1 to `m`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `j` is at least `m + 1`. This means that `j` has already exceeded the maximum value that allows the loop to execute. To enable the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted back to at least `1` and `m` also needs to be adjusted so that it can be equal to or greater than `1`. Thus, `m` must be at least `1` to allow `j` to be within the valid range of the loop (from `1` to `m`).

State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and `k` varies from 1 to `s`.**
