Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `k`, and `s` (where `k` is equal to `s + 1`). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to the previous computed value. The updates to `dp` respect the modulo operation to handle potential overflow.***
