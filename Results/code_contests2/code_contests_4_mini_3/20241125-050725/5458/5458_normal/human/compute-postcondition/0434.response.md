According to the code, the loop executes `n ** 2` times, with `i` iterating from 0 up to `n ** 2 - 1`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is still less than `n ** 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum value of `n ** 2 - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n ** 2`. This means that `i` should be adjusted from `n ** 2 - 1` to `n ** 2`.

No other states need to be adjusted because `s`, `j`, `m`, and `mod` are not directly affected by the loop iteration control variable `i`.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is n ** 2, `mod` is defined and non-zero**
