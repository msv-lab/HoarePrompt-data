To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration and the loop header.

1. **Loop Header Analysis**: The loop iterates over `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute an additional time, `k` must be less than `s`, as it will increment `k` by 1 on each iteration.

2. **State Analysis**: 
   - We know that `s` is greater than or equal to 1, so `s + 1` is at least 2. 
   - From the information provided, since `k` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be updated to 2 in the next iteration.
   - Thus, we need to ensure that `k` is less than `s`. Since `k` is currently 1, `s` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run again.

3. **Conclusion**: 
   - We need to adjust `s` to ensure it is greater than 1 (i.e., `s` is at least 2) in order to allow `k` to be incremented from 1 to 2 for the next iteration. 
   - `k` should also be updated to 2.

Therefore, the adjustments needed for the states are:
- Set `s` to be greater than or equal to 2.
- Set `k` to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2**.
