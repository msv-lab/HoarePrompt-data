The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since the variables and their values remain unchanged by this statement, we can conclude that there are no changes to `n`, `i`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, or `k`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values along with the note that we are continuing in the loop.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is larger than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) and each inner list is of size (s + 1), `j` is greater than `k`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 and we continue in the loop.**
