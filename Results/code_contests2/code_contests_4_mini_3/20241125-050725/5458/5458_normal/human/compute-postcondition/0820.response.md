Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes to `dp` occur in this fragment.***
