According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop continues as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 2 and `k` is 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, `k` needs to be adjusted to 3, while `s` remains unchanged since it is at least 2.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m`, and `k` is 3**
